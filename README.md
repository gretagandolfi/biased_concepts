Shared repository for codes and data. 

__corpus__ contains the Reddit dataset. By now, I aggregated data from the following subreddits: 
- democrats + friends grops + moderators
- republicans + friends grops + moderators

__scrape__ contains the jupyter notebooks with codes to extract data. You will find two different notebooks used to collect data from moderators' production and submissions.
