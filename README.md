Shared repository for codes and data. 

__corpus.zip__ contains the Reddit dataset. By now, I put together data from the following subreddits: 
- democrats + friend groups + moderators + update: r/SandersForPresident and mods + r/politics and mods 
- republicans + friend groups + moderators + update: r/Conservative and mods + r/The Donald and mods 

__scrape__ contains the jupyter notebooks with codes to extract data. You will find two different notebooks used to collect data from moderators' production and submissions. 

__fasttext__ contains the folder code (with the python files on training, optimization, perturbation and evaliation) and the folder eval_dataset (MEN and SimLex dataset).  

__updates.md__ is a summary of what I've been doing/what I have to do (week by week)
