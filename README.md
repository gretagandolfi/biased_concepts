Shared repository for codes and data. 

__corpus__ contains the Reddit dataset. By now, I aggregated data from the following subreddits: 
- democrats + friend groups + moderators
- republicans + friend groups + moderators

__scrape__ contains the jupyter notebooks with codes to extract data. You will find two different notebooks used to collect data from moderators' production and submissions. 

__fasttext__ contains the jupyter notebooks with codes to build the representations of the corpora and to evaluate them against the similarity scores of MEN dataset.
