# thesis
Shared repository for codes and data. 

__corpus__ contains the Reddit dataset. By now, I aggregated data from the following subreddits: 
- democrats + friend groups + moderators
- republicans + friend groups + moderators

__scrape__ contains the jupyter notebooks with codes to extract data. You will find two different notebooks used to collect data from moderators' production and submissions. 

__fasttext_gensim__ is the notebook in which I built the vectorial represenation of both corpora.
