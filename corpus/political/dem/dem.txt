Please go out and vote for whichever candidate checks all those boxes for you. It doesn’t matter if that’s Sanders, Warren, Biden, or anyone else running. JUST VOTE. When it comes to the GE, however, I just hope that everyone remembers that we must weigh pragmatism vs idealism. Yes, we would all like our ideal candidate to go against Trump. But that’s not how our elections work, and the two-party system is the system we have to work with. There are no moral or emotional victories in protest voting or abstaining from voting; not when migrant children are sleeping in cages at the border, not when back-door deals are made to pad the pockets of the ultra-rich, not when taxpayers are strapped with paying for golfing trips and military parades, not when the makeup of the Supreme Court is at stake, and not when vital agency positions are given to players hell-bent on tearing down the very functions and foundations of our government. Unless you can convince yourself that you are fine with these things happening, it is disingenuous and hurtful to throw your vote away to “prove a point.” Voting out Trump means voting for WHOEVER the Dem candidate running against him is.

Please Beto, Run against Cornyn!  Please Abrams, run for the Senate in Georgia.  Please please please Hickenlooper!  You can take out Gardener.Please stop running for President!  The senate is more important that the white house!  We have all of our eggs in one basket!                                                                                                                            In an Op-Ed in today's NYT "Straining to Keep Faith with America" Bret Stephens has trashed Trump in no uncertain terms by adding this in his piece "John McCain knew that we are better than Trump."To that I like to add my own thoughts saying that maybe, I emphasize the word "maybe" again to say that maybe a healthy Senator McCain could put a stop to a marauding president called Trump. But with the Republican Senator John McCain's death, there is nothing that can stop Trump from destroying each and every American values that this country developed over two centuries plus more.Even a Republican president Ronald Reagan's description of America was much different from Trump's vision.By quoting a phrase from Jesus's Sermon on the Mount, Reagan declared that our country is like "a shining city on a hill".But since Trump took over the presidency, every Americans are "straining to keep Faith with America", the country they love dearly unlike Trump and his followers who only think of what they can get. Even Democratic president John Kennedy's words on his inauguration on January 20th, 1961, "Ask not what your country can do for you_ask what can do for your country", have no sway over the minds of these fake "swamp cleaners" like Trump. Trump is more interested in finding how much money he can milk from his presidency than giving some of his assets to the countrymen who were really struggling everyday to keep their faith on America.Their struggles to keep faith on our institutions are four hundred times more now than before Trump took office on Jan 20th, '17.That is the reason why we've to feel sorry for John McCain's permanent absence from an institution, mainly the Senate where he grilled each and every Trump's appointees and his cabinet members to hit hard at Trump's illogical policies.Trump on the other hand didn't have the decency to go to McCain before his death or to his wife and families now to apologize saying, "I should've never said that I don't care for people like you who got captured at war. As you know I didn't go to Vietnam for my bad foot. But I really appreciate your pains and sufferings due to terrible tortures at the hands of the Vietcong guerrillas. I'm really sorry that you endured those tortures for five plus years just to keep our country safe. May God bless your soul."Am I really dreaming that Trump would say those kind words and apologize to John McCain or his wife Cindy or his children or to all our POWs ?  Not in a million years ! No way .         I used to be a very hard right man. I wanted jobs for Americans only. I wanted punishment for people sneaking across the border, and I wanted everyone to think like me. A few days ago I took the political compass test and it turns out I'm actually more of a democrat. I've come to learn that the wealthy are hoarding the wealth and people like me a suffering. I look across the pond and see my Scandinavian cousins and their free healthcare and tuition free college and more time off and I'm dismayed. I've been lied to my whole life about who really cares about poor folks like me and now that my eyes are open, I'm coming home!                           Check out @SpeakerPelosi’s Tweet: https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1087743517466787841?s=09                                            There are 20 Dems running in the primary. That means 19 *will* lose. Some early, some late; some will put up a good fight, others not so much. Sure, one may be chosen as VP candidate, but understand, chances are that your first choice guy/gal in the race will likely lose.Pragmatism is the name of the game when it comes to the GE; not nit-picky purity tests. Otherwise, staying home, or write-ins, or other forms of protesting the winner of the Dem primary because he/she was not your first choice just ensures another 4 years of Trump. There are 20 people running who I'd personally like to see occupy the the WH over its current inhabitant. We can't win the race when we're so set on fighting amongst ourselves.                                                                                                                                                                                                              “Republicans approve of the American farmer, but they are willing to help him go broke. They stand four-square for the American home — but not for housing. They are strong for labor — but they are stronger for restricting labor’s rights. They favor minimum wage — the smaller the minimum wage the better. They endorse educational opportunity for all — but they won’t spend money for teachers or for schools. They think modern medical care and hospitals are fine — for people who can afford them. They consider electrical power a great blessing — but only when the private power companies get their rake-off. They think American standard of living is a fine thing — so long as it doesn’t spread to all the people. And they admire of Government of the United States so much that they would like to buy it.”                                                                        Change my mind                                                                                                            Yes, if a partisan judge from Texas thinks he can make the lives of 133 million people worse by removing their only healthcare that they gained through Obamacare, then that crooked judge should've never gone to a law school to become a jurist.As a mater of fact that judge belongs to the same doghouse where his racist president belongs to.Mr. Reed O'Connor should not be respected or referred to as a judge by the people going to his court.Judge O'Connor rather deserves the ultimate anger and venom from the rest of the population of this country beside the millions of Americans who might lose their medical care if his judgement stands against the appeal by the State of California and 18 other states who made their oral arguments in front of him earlier to keep the A.C.A. as it is.In "A Partisan Ruling on Obamacare" Christian Farias has presented more facts than we can handle about this terrible judgement by Judge O"Connor.Mr. Farias also told us through his Op-Ed in today's NYT about where Trump and the Republicans stand on this horrible judgement by a partisan judge in Texas.Yes, in case some Americans do not know yet, Trump and the crooked Republicans stand to gain billions of dollars by signing new contracts with all the doctors and hospitals and medical clinics and the insurance companies all over the country if somehow they can win this game of scrapping Obamacare and get it replaced by their own version of Trumpcare.We know that Trump, who was always a crooked businessman along with his brothers and sisters, accepted this verdict very gleefully thinking how much money he personally would make from this huge turnover of a very popular healthcare known by his nemesis president Obama whom he hated from the core of his heart only because our last president was Black.In another Op-Ed in today's NYT titled," As the Trumps Dodged Taxes, their Tets paid a Price", Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig have presented us with a mindset of Trump, his father and his siblings who fleeced thousands of their father's tets in New York and other places by padding up their invoices of rendering small services in the entire apartment complex.In the '80s and '90s New York, this crooked bunch extracted higher rents from their poor tets living in Beach Haven Apartments in Brooklyn and other properties in Coney Island, Queens and Staten Island of NYC that his father Fred C. Trump owned by just submitting highly falsified invoices to the Rent Control Departments of New York."The padded invoices have been baked into the base rent used to calculate the annual percentage increase approved by the city" is how Trumps fleeced their tets as per the authors of this article.No wonder Trump took this verdict from another racist judge like him from Texas, as a testament to his power over a section of the population who dislike anything Obama had achieved as the president only because of the dark color of his skin.Trump also felt really happy inside from this judgement because of the way this verdict will pave the way for him to make more money than he ever made before.But as we all know that this ruling by this partisan judge might be overturned by the United States court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit or the Supreme Court ,Trump has no reason to be bragging about anything out of this fiasco.                title Bill Gates thinks the 1% should foot the bill for renewable energy, and he's offering the first $2B.

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a "business pitch" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.

If we treat this as an opinion, or a political agenda, we'll pay for it.                          WE NEED TO ORGANIZE UNDER ONE UMBRELLA TO SHOW REAL POWER.Hi I’m an average guy who woke up an activist on November 9th and found this march: Tell EVERYBODY. Game on, April 29, 2017.[Peoplesclimate.org](https://peoplesclimate.org/). Lets tell our representatives we want to **stay in the Paris Agreement!** If they don't, they'll see we're organized and will vote them out!10 million strong, seriously. Aim high. ACT LIKE CHAMPIONS! LET'S DO THIS! And then at least feel like we've tried and done something historic, ya know? ________**Edit:**To address concerns in the comments: **pledge to lower your CO2 spent to get to the march.** This sends a good signal, such as: train = if you can take a train. car = carpool. bus = rally bus. airplane = carbon offset (plant 25 trees per person). **Other ideas?** Especially for those who'd have to fly?Let’s take an extreme scenario where a many people fly all the way across the country. That would cost at most in hundreds of thousands of metric tons of CO2 emissions. [carbon calculator](http://calculator.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx?tab=3) Staying in the Paris Agreement **reduces carbon emissions by BILLIONS of metric tons and puts us on a sustainable course for good.**The top grey dotted line in [this info graphic](http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/US-emissions-chart.jpg) is if the Paris Agreement with American participation doesn’t happen. Game over._________[Peoplesclimate.org](https://peoplesclimate.org/) are the same folks that organized the biggest climate march to date in 2014 with hundreds of thousands. Now they’re at it again, on April 29th 2017 right before Trump's 100 days.Are there other groups that combine environmental organizations that you know of? If so, who? Get them to join this march! Are there other marches scheduled that others don't know of yet? How can we combine them into one massive showing?I think his election is scaring many of us (myself being an example) into activism mode, rather than assuming our gov is taking care of the problem (like the Paris global initiative Obama put together that Trump threatens to dismantle).___________________INVITE EVERYONE WHO ALREADY CARESPeoplesclimate.org is a combo of dozens of organizations, including 350.org, as seen at bottom of page. Let's help them add even more to the list. **Invite Bernie** and his millions on board, all democrats and more Environmental Organizations.Invite DiCaprio who made the powerful documentary Before the Flood, and has millions of twitter followers. And other passionate media folks and celebrities who can reach the masses. If you happen to know any, invite them!And the Clintons, and Gore. If this is really about the preservation of our planet, it's wake up time.Reach out to younger people in their 20s and even High School, who will inherit this planet. Reach to all environmental organizations and get them to join this march, like The Sierra Club and … ?How about religious organizations? Even the POPE spoke out recently!!! This involves ALL OF US. This is something we can all agree and come together on!__________REACHING OUT TO MODERATE CONSERVATIVESI've actually seen on reddit that moderate conservatives, many who voted Trump, still believe in climate change. I think we should make it a CENTRIST issue. Take out the political charge, and base it in stewards of our earth and country. Reach across the divide, why not? Have some real conversations based in fact. Know the economic concerns of those who push back against regulation and acknowledge them, and support them in adapting.Recent reddit comments brought up the fact that if sea level rise doesn't scare em into action, which may not matter as much to those inland as it does on the coast, then reframe it to the impact of stronger storms and tornados, and droughts on crop production. And overall the impact on our economy if the coastal cities and towns are under water.We need republican support in congress to move the needle. and if not, then they need to be afraid of getting reelected.This fella is trying, for example: [Jay Faison's Quest to Save the Planet (And the GOP)](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-11-01/jay-faison-s-expensive-maddening-quest-to-save-the-planet-and-the-gop)______________MASSIVE MOVEMENT BRINGS EDUCATION AND ACTION10 million people marching. I'm not even kidding. 20 million Muslims just marched in Iraq against ISIS. 2 million marched in South Korea against their president. If they all can organize in face of a dire threat, so can we.In addition to marching, just organizing into a mass movement can spread actionable ideas. Educating people on the low hanging fruit, the easier first steps towards reducing emissions in our day to day choices. If millions organize and speak with our votes and dollars ... support green initiatives and companies, then we fight through governmental and capitalist methods. The carbon tax for example is the biggest government move. We need to educate ourselves on a deeper level on the real issue(s), like the pros/cons of the carbon tax. I understand it could hurt business profit, which is the reason for so much push back. And that we're taking on more of the burden as part of the Paris Accord then the rest of the world, is another push back I've read. We need intelligent answers to these issues. And Climate Denial? The Pentagon and NASA have published proof of our impact on Climate Change. We need to counter the vocal deniers.  But we already have the numbers for massive action. There’s a reason why Obama was able to align 197 countries in the Paris Agreement.We fixed the ozone layer, we've increased fuel efficiency, and safety. We can do this heavy lift, even if it imposes on profit, if it's necessary to support life on freaking earth!__________________________LOCAL MAYORS ARE PROVING AWESOMEAlso, local moves. Mayors are powerful:Check this action out by Europe, 10 major cities banning diesel for green: http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-38170794WE can do this in the USA. 35 of OUR BIG CITY MAYORS just wrote this letter:https://www.good.is/articles/mayor-open-letter-trump-climate-changemore inspiration:http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2016/11/trump_s_anti_environment_agenda_could_propel_the_movement_forward.htmlReply here to keep brainstorming. It feels good to at least be doing something.And social media is how Trump won, we can wield it too. It's an insanely powerful force for any movement when the communication is solid.**TLDR:There's a major march to stay in the Paris Agreement and combat Climate Change. It's in D.C. on April 29, 2017. [Peoplesclimate.org](https://peoplesclimate.org/). This is our chance, please come! And link other organizations so we can build one massive movement and make this issue CENTRIST and CENTRAL to our government and all Americans.**                                                  I made the 3-piece-routine a habit a couple of weeks ago. This way I cleaned the  small wood where I go out with our doggo from every single bit of  trash. It’s not hard work and very satisfying! I will continue doing  that everywhere I go. Reddit, what do you think?!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Remember when Trump warned about “a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities”?  Trump seems to be doing his best to give these Wall Street banksters control of the government. Trump’s swamp includes:* A director of the National Economic Council (Gary Cohn) who is **president of Goldman Sachs**, the bank that helped bring down the economy in 2008.* A Secretary of the Treasury (Steve Mnuchin) who is the son of a Goldman Sachs partner and who **worked at Goldman Sachs himself for 17 years** (which the official GOP bio conveniently omitted). He then purchased and chaired OneWest Bank, which foreclosed on tens of thousands of innocent homeowners, and preyed on senior citizens. * A Chief Strategist (Stephen K. Bannon) who is a **former Goldman banker**.* A Secretary of Commerce (Wilbur Ross) who has **a private equity firm**, WL Ross & Co. that paid a $2.3 million fine for failing to properly disclose fees it charged.* A Secretary of Transportation (Elaine Chao) who made $1.2 million as **a director of Wells Fargo Bank** during the period the company created millions of fake customer accounts and fired employees who tried to stop the fraud.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I am angry.I am angry I can't even take public transportation (i.e. bus, uber, taxi, etc.) without fear of being kidnapped.I am angry that the idea of traveling alone places holds me back from exploring the world.I am angry that something as simple as declining to be romantically involved with a man may threaten my life.I am angry that I am not strong enough to physically overpower a man trying to hurt me, despite working out and lifting weights.I am angry that I automatically go into panic and suspicion mode as soon as the sun goes down.I am angry that being a woman has made me a target just by existing.I am angry that my male friends don't understand my fears.I am angry that male colleagues think I am over-exaggerating when I talk about how I am always on edge when I am doing something as simple as going to the grocery store alone.I am ANGRY. It's not fair. I just want to exist. I just want to be able to do whatever I want as an independent adult.Edit: thank you to whoever gave me my first gold! It means a lot to me. Secondly, I've gotten a lot of comment about not living in fear. I just wanna say that I am currently studying abroad in a foreign country and made this post after being annoyed at all the precautions the women in my program have had to take surrounding traveling versus the men and just needed to rant....I promise I'm not restricting my life because of this frustration :)                         This bothers me to no end. If women who squat didn't leave their urine on the seat, there would be no need to squat! Squatters who don't wipe causes a chain reaction of wet seats and squatting fuckery.                  So yesterday had a meeting at work with several board members. The issue is one that I have been working on for 6 years. Every time I start making progress on the issue I get stopped bc the board members get nervous. But yesterday the board invited a person who works independently on this issue to speak. He was old, he was white, and he was a man. He said everything I have been saying for the past 6 years. And they loved him. They agreed to everything. They were ready to throw money at him. It was ridiculous. So someone needs to start a business where you can rent an old white man to go to your board meetings, or go to your interviews, loan applications, and where ever else other old white men make decisions that will affect you bc obviously I don't speak that language.      Scrolling through r/guitar or r/freefolk I constantly see people saying like "hey boys" or "this guy gets it". It's just so disheartening. This assumption that only men are on the internet just perpetuates itself and I hate the lack of visibility women have on reddit. Why is it never gender-neutral language?! :/ Any idea how to change this?                    Today was a humbling day for me. I’ve always known what I titled this post to be true, but it really only hit me today when I watched the guy I like flirt with another girl all day. The point of this post is to remind everyone that crushing on people who aren’t reciprocating the way you want them to are a god damn waste of time. I’ve spent way too much time trying to convince myself that a guy I’m crushing on remotely likes me, even though deep down I know I’m lying to myself.Don’t ignore the gut feelings you have about people and don’t let your emotions blind you and make you forget the reality of the situation at hand. If someone likes you, you will KNOW. And that’s final. If they aren’t trying to talk to you, be around you, ask you out, etc...do yourself a favor and move the fuck on. You deserve someone who wants you, who can’t wait to talk to you and to spend time with you... don’t accept any less. I just wanted everyone to remember this because I forgot and blinded myself for a little too long and now I realize that I’m the fucking shit and I deserve better. For anyone who feels my pain, you deserve better too. Have a great evening folks. This morning, I put on shorts. Not because it was hot or because I wanted to look cute. But because, despite the overcast weather, I was lazy and didn't want to spare the mental energy of planning an outfit. My dog was whining to go outside and my husband was already answering texts from work. I, on the other hand, only had my appointment and the loose desire to write afterwards.So I wore a clean black top and the shorts that hung off of my dresser from the day before. I didn't even bother shaving my legs.Therapy was ripe. We discussed how my past trauma informed current day behaviors; how I exhibit fear behaviors in response to even benign expressions of frustration or anger. How an emotionally volatile childhood home made me afraid to express my feelings of fear and sadness in healthy ways.I cried when I left therapy. I sat in my car and cried. And then I thought about going home. But on my passenger seat was a bag of Lowe's returns, and it sucks getting paid biweekly. So I wiped my tears, I rubbed my cheeks, I flattened my hair, and I drove to Lowe's.When I got out, the $15 from the return mingled with the $20 in my wallet, and I decided I should deposit it (because, again, biweekly pay). Lucky me, my bank was in a grocery store right next door. I went in, used the ATM, got my receipt and left the building. My EMT friend replied to a joke I thought of in the waiting room ("Sometimes 'analgesic' is a pun") and I mustered a smile before starting across the parking lot. And then-And then a random guy in a truck sticks his head out of his window and into my bubble, looks me square in the face, and says, "Nice legs." Not even that I, a person, have nice legs. Just, "Nice legs."I come home and sit down to write, but what comes to me is not the fantasy story I want to tell. What comes to me is how sometimes, when women point out the things that make us uncomfortable (calling us "females" instead of women; telling us to smile), we are called "man-haters" or "over-sensitive" or "angry feminists" or "feminazis" in return (or "unbelievably stupid time-wasters obsessing on the least important things possible"). I think about how I'm not angry; I can't even muster the emotional energy to be angry at that guy who inserted himself into my day. I do not hate men; my favorite human happens to be a man. And perhaps for the first time in my life, I'm finally becoming sensitive enough to my needs to start treating myself with respect, so no, I don't agree with the assessment that I'm "over-sensitive." I just happened to dislike that man's behavior.And now I'm writing about that behavior, not to say, "Oh, poor victim me. Pity me. Mourn with me! Rage with me!" I am writing this to say that sometimes, the random little impulses that you, a stranger, have are so at odds with my interior life that it is jarring. It is uncomfortable. And sometimes, it triggers that fear response in me that makes me feel unsafe.          i don’t know where else to post this, or what to say, or how to feel. i just needed to tell someone.                            This morning I turned on a news channel to discover that a girl had been raped. She was around my age and was a veterinarian. She was a normal girl living away from her family for her career. She was raped by four men and burnt alive.  I stayed away from the TV and social media all of today. I know what I would've seen. Men saying not all men, Indian meme pages making content about this without sensitivity, politicians saying it isn't possible for police to be everywhere, and people questioning why she outside at night in the first place. An hour ago, I decided I would just check my IG. I opened my Instagram feed and saw all of this. And I also saw that another woman's charred body has been found in the same area. She was just living her life. The rapists noticed where she'd parked her Vespa, and slashed her tire. It was premeditated. It seems that women in my country have to move in packs if we want to survive. Her face and details are plastered over all the main media channels. I don't want to see her face, because I know this is not how any woman wants to be known. The same people who cry about women's safety today will go back to objectifying actresses and mocking feminists tomorrow. While I was looking at Instagram, trying to find something to take my mind off of this, I saw a picture of a former child actress. She seemed to be in her early teens, and the comments section was disgusting. I was only thankful that the picture was posted by some media outlet and not the child herself. I was hoping she wouldn't see the things written about her.I'm starting to dream of a place free of men. Not all men, as men so frequently say. Just, it seems, a place free of a majority of them.I'm not going to post links. You guys can find news on it if you want to. I just wanted to get this out somewhere, and just express my anger and frustration somehow.And now, on a final note, as I'm about to close my Instagram I see one last thing. Four rapists killed their friend, fighting over whose turn it was to rape a woman. I cannot make this stuff up.I'm going to go do something else before this completely overtakes me.                    So wanted to share something that happened today because I’m wondering what others would have done! So today I was driving down the street with my male friend in the back seat and as we stopped at a red light I noticed a young lady who was waiting for the bus and there was a man leaning up on her completely harassing her! You could tell by the look on her face that she needed help! I mouthed “are you okay?” And she shook her head! The light had turned green and there were cars behind me but I knew I had to do something so I stayed stopped rolled down the window and yelled “hey (selected a random name), Hop in!” I knew this was risky since I didn’t know her and she didn’t know me but she needed help! So she hopped in and he was yelling so as soon as she closed the door I hit the gas! I was only going to take her to the next bus stop but as we got to talking I realized she lives on Rez at the university I used to go to and I was going that way anyways so I offered to drive her the full way and she accepted! As we drove I introduced myself, learned that she was new to my area as she’s an exchange student from France, and we spoke about how she was settling in! I never got her name but she was so thankful and sweet when I dropped her off! If you were in a similar situation would you have offered for the woman to get in your car? Would you have parked your car at the first spot you could find and went over to stand with her until the bus came? Would you have confronted the guy?I felt kinda creepy just being like “hey you don’t know me but I know you need help so get into my (a stranger’s) car!” But at the same time I just couldn’t leave her there knowing a guy was harassing her and making her so uncomfortable! My mindset is women stand up for other women so I’m happy I could help her but now I’m curious as to how others would have handled the situation!

Specific situation: a guy friend of mine expressed that it is easier for women to get the same job as men. This statement infuriated me, especially because, considering the profession I am in, this is not the case. The fice world is very much white male dominated. I have experienced this for years and have been in situations where I very much felt disadvantaged to males. Did I whine about it? No I fucking strapped up my boots and delivered twice as much as a male would. And then for someone to go back and say “oh you just got this job because you’re a woman and they need to check off their diversity box”. I hate this. Makes me think that men are insecure about a woman outshining them. So they deflect their insecurities by using this lame excuse. If only they knew that women have to do twice as much just to gain the same recognition as them. I just needed to rant about this because I hear this lame fucking excuse way too often. Instead, men should be the first to recognize your achievements and applaud your hard work.   I way 131 lbs as of this morning. I jog in place while taking care of the baby and working a full time job from home until my apple watch tells me I have burnt 600 calories doing so. I do this everyday. My meals consist of blueberries, salami, and nutz. My bf asked the baby and me to move to dc with him last december. Here we are. In DC ( From Austin ) knowing full well I cannot afford to live here on my own. He says he will never be happy because he has so much pent up anger at me for the way I look. Just wtf guys.   I mean I thought this was common knowledge but apparently not. As the title suggests, a stranger today asked me how many weeks pregt I am and I am definitely not pregt. I was buying lunch today at a fast-food establishment and as these encounters usually are, it was an incredibly uncomfortable experience. I simply told her I am not pregt,  grabbed my food and got out of there. When I was driving back to the office I thought to myself I should have told her I  was a few weeks pregt and I would have saved both of us from feeling uncomfortable. However, I was not thinking this quick on my feet and in hindsight, I am glad I didn't because maybe this woman will be a little bit more careful in the future.Now a quick back story. I have PCOS which is a hormonal disorder that affects weight gain and it can be incredibly difficult for us to lose weight. Weight generally accumulates in the midsection so it is not uncommon for ladies like us to have a bit of a pouch. PCOS can cause infertility. It can also cause mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. Of course, this woman did not know this.Now with that being said, I am recovering from pretty bad disordered eating behaviors. Including but not limited to, undereating, over-exercising, and laxative abuse. She did not know this either.Overall I am in a very good place in my life. I am not the thinnest I have ever been but I am happy and comfortable with myself. I go out for dinner with friends, I enjoy food that comforts my soul, and I don't freak out if life gets busy and I miss a workout. I am proud of how far I have come but that does not give anyone a right to ask me such a personal question about my body. I am grateful that I am in the place that I am because if this happened a year ago it would have sent me into a complete emotional tailspin.I type this as I am shamelessly eating Doritos in bed because why the fuck wouldn't IEnd rant     today 2 hours in to a 14hour train journey I got my period. After giving up on any chance of getting a pad, I just looked to the girl in the adjacent seat. Went to her and said “can I borrow a pad?” , That’s all it took . She reached for her bag ,searched and gave me one. Thanks stranger sister. Sisterhood of bleeding women is real. Thanks for all kindness. edit: I use cup usually but I will carry one for anyone in need from now on to return the love! My (23f) roomate (22m) who I love like a brother PISSES ME OFF about how he talks about women a lot go the time. He’s a great guy, and I get so annoyed with him because he’s making no effort to see things from a woman’s perspective. I’ll give an exact example. He took the girl he’s dating and their friend on his boat and made a comment that he was annoyed he couldn’t stare at the friends boobs because she was so hot. And then made another joke about going over heavy wake so they could go up and down. Another time a girl he knew was simply brought up in conversation and he goes “she’s not as hot as she used to be.” Like ok? No one asked? He doesn’t see these examples as objectifying women and I don’t understand how he laughs at it. Are all men like this? Does he not know how creeped out these young women would be if they were to hear him say that? Please give me advice on how to communicate just how inconsiderate he is being.      Last night I was telling my husband a story from my past that had never come up before.I forget what exactly it was that brought us to the mouth of the rabbit hole, but something, some story did.He didn’t believe one of the details that I had shared. I followed it up with a few corroborating examples, one of which being a simple question: “How old do you think I was the first time that I was cat-called?”He was shocked that I had experienced something like that. So I asked him again: “How Old?”He was at a loss, so I told him: 10. I was 10 years old the first time that men would honk the horns in their pick up trucks and pull up slowly to yell things at me as I walked down the side walk.He couldn’t believe it.I told him that it didn’t stop there. That I couldn’t walk down the hallway if my middle school without getting groped.I told him about the callous words thrown at me by boys I had liked and ways that I was betrayed by boys who I had honestly thought were my friends. Boys from good upstanding families.I told him about some of the college parties that I’d thought I was so cool to be crashing while in high school. I told him him about some of the things that happened there...and that there were chunks that I couldn’t even remember. I don’t know why, but it’s like the floodgates broke. Everything, or nearly everything spilled out.My husband is a good man. A man who I truly believe loves me more than his own life.The one thing he kept saying over and over again was how “well adjusted” I am. That he never would have known or guessed. That I didn’t seem broken. I calmly told him that none of us do.All of the women who are casually degraded our entire lives aren’t broken by these things, but that doesn’t make them right.None of this was right, but I had so many friends who endured so much worse. All of it was just so normal. I’m not sure that I believe that it actually is better for anyone else.    i've been told that i'm naturally flirtatious but to me i'm just being friendly. i laugh and make strong eye contact and smile a lot when i'm in a conversation. men and women have mistaken this as me flirting with them. sometimes i don't mind and sometimes it's extremely annoying. especially when the person blames me for leading them on when they ask me out and i decline. since when is being a nice friendly person an automatic signal of flirtation? when i'm flirting with someone i think i'm extremely obvious and all my past bfs have confirmed this.  i'm not looking to change my personality but this has been happening more often lately and it makes me feel 1) bad for the person i "lead on" without even knowing and 2) it makes me feel like people only see me as hookup/dating material.anybody else get this a lot? i also have always worked in customer service where you have to be a naturally friendly and caring person.     This is a growing problem, and I wanna talk about it and see what other women experience.  I don't like butt-stuff. I don't like anal. I don't like it. I hate this "If you don't like anal you've never tried anal" bull shit. I've tried anal. I don't like anal. Cis women dont have a g-spot in their anus- and while some women may feel pleasure from this-- I just DONT.  The act of it doesn't innately upset me. It doesn't give me PTSD or anything else you usually get when you throw around the word 'rape'  But I've been like "Hey I dont like butt stuff." to guys. They put a finger in when we're intimate. I stop everything, look them stern in the eye and say "Hey I dont you I dont like butt stuff what the FUCK are you doing???"  they apologize.. Next time we're intimiate. BAM. I like just stop it. I'm like "WHAT THE FUCK."   Usually after that, they learn--- but they still werent compatible.  Now it's not EVERY partner i've been with-- but it's a good hunk of them. It hasn't been until the #metoo movement have I been like "WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING" and calling it out on the spot.   Cause I told them I don't like it-- they do it-- in a way that's rape. It's just a very casual rape compared to most.  It's still a lack of respect, it's still coming at my body how they want to even if it's at odds with my very clear verbal expressions-- and I'm PISSED AS HELL RIGHT NOW!  Blah! It just makes being intimate with guys that much harder because i think at this point in my life-- that's just a deal breaker if they can't listen the first damn time.&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;           Some "sexual" language obviously, body parts and all that fun jazz. I just needed a safe place to rant a little because my family and adult friends are driving me insane. I have spastic diplegic cerebral palsy. So basically my leg muscles are too tight. I've tried to explain to my friends and family that I don't need the sex talk over and over just because I'm in college. I physically can not have sex. You know why? Here's why. 1. "That" is a muscle. My muscles *are too tight* 2. Don't believe me? I'm over exaggerating? Well I tried wearing a tampon twice in my life. Both times went horribly wrong. The first time I was 12 and tried to pull the damn thing out myself. That was a fucking mistake. I was at a pool party and one of the moms could see I was in visible pain. The second time I was at the beach. Little older. Went home, removed it and laid in bed for three hours because I felt like a rod just split my body up the middle. People try to tell me my body works just fine. It doesn't. I avoid any screening from the OBGYN at ALL costs. I'm hoping when I'm old enough to get a pap smear they'll diagnosis me with vaginitmus or something. ALSO. I'm asexual sex repulsed. I don't WANT that. But again, no one believes me. I don't want any of that. I don't want kids. Stop going into nasty details               We met online in September. He lives about four hours from me but we see each other every 2-3 weeks. He’s the second guy I’ve dated since my divorce was final earlier this year, and you guys...he’s so amazing.He’s a real genuine cowboy. Not the type of guy I’d ever imagine being with, but life had other plans I guess. His voice makes me swoon and the first time he called me I said “Wow, I really like your voice” like a total weirdo. He’s polite, respectful of physical boundaries (we haven’t had sex yet but I am more than ok with that), genuine and kind..I could go on and on.He always opens the car door for me as well as the doors to restaurants or shops or whatever. I’m so not used to it. He was kind of grumpy on the phone the other day (his truck is having major issues and he’s without a vehicle this week), and he apologized for how he acted. The simple act of him apologizing really blew my mind - my ex husband was a total narcissist and did no wrong because everything was always my fault. It’s just so amazing to be treated with respect for once, to have actual conversations, to feel safe and not scared with I’m with him, to actually be not just looked at but seen. We also have the same tattoo in the same location in the same color! Totally crazy and it makes me smile whenever I think about it.I’m just really happy. I feel so undeserving of such a perfect guy. We are taking this slow and just really enjoying our time together. I met his parents and some friends about 2 months ago and celebrated Christmas with them this past week.Thanks for reading, I just had to share.    I usually shave my legs in the summer; but during the winter, I almost always have on pants, leggings, or tights.  How do you feel about letting people see your legs when you aren’t fresh shaven?      I'm just maaad right now, so here's a rant!I played a really great rock show tonight with my amazing all-woman rock band. It was so powerful and there was so much girl power in the room, everyone was feeling that beautiful vibe. Then while taking down my guitar gear some dumbass stranger (30-ish years old?) giggled and grabbed my butt, like what the FUCK?! I tore into him and told him he was a fucking predator and then he "apologized" quietly and hurried out of the bar.I'm just furious that there are people out there who feel that they are entitled to treating women like sex objects, that they feel they have the right to just touch whomever wherever on a whim and ruin their night. I'm not an object!, I'm a woman and I am a human being! Just seething right now, I want this world to not be one where I feel afraid to just play a little rock show at a local bar, it's always so shocking/unexpected and it's like fucking NOWHERE is safe for women & girls. Ugh! Anyone else feel my rage? I'm just so pissed. How do you deal with this anger towards predators? I would really love some advice on dealing with these emotions. Thanks in advance, and love to you all.                 Never posted here before, but another sub keeps removing it for no reason, and I just have to tell someone with a vagina this story, my man friends don't get it:&#x200B;i got a text from my boss "You there?"'yeah, what's up''just got a call from \[boss' boss\]''crap...good or bad?''good, i think. i guess there's an opening in fice and someone mentioned your name in regards to it. he wanted to know what i think, so i told him i thought it might be a good opportunity for you. didn't say more than that.'i am freaking STUNNED. i've only been in my position for 1 year. before that i spent 3 years in the call center pool as a grunt for customers to yell at, until my boss cherry picked me out for my corporate position.'oh. well that's unexpected. who's leaving?''\[so and so\] apparently.'never heard of her. look her up. she's a tier 2 manager... That would be a quantum leap from where i'm at. but i brushed it off thinking i'm never going to hear about this again, there's no way someone would offer this to me so why do i bother. then today talking with my boss on the phone, i find out that it's his boss' boss who threw my name out, and it's more likely i'll be approached than i thought, because the person that manager would answer to is someone i actually work with more closely than i initially thought.i'm a STEM chick with an art degree, working with like 95% men, all of women i am younger than by about a decade, many of them more than that. i don't exactly see myself as the picture of success, nor have i ever in the past. i am tickled the blushiest of pinks right now. i mean, no one has actually asked me yet, but to know that someone thinks i should be is just...wow.barely more than a year ago i thought i was never going to go anywhere in life, now there's a possibility i could be a manger at a corporate headquarters in an international corporation in charge of some global initiatives. just felt like sharing. goes to show, we can do it :) I recently realized I didn’t own a pair of sweatpants, so last time I was at H&M I decided to go buy some. I tried them on and they were super comfy, then today when I actually decided to wear them properly I realized they have no pockets🙃🙃🙃With jeans and leggings it’s one thing, I sort of get it, but with sweatpants it’s like ??? aren’t these DESIGNED to be comfy?? Yet no pockets. I don’t get it. I really don’t. Thank you for coming to my rant/TED talk.      I've tried three times to find a way to write this without being too emotional or too vague. I can't do it, I'm just going to have to stick to the facts and hope that some of you will take the time to read further.80% of the global supplies of coltan, cobalt and cassiterite are mined in the Congo. Those minerals go into our phones, televisions, laptops. There is a war being fought for control of the mines. International mineral companies are [fuelling the war](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8159977.stm). More than four million people have died. Guerrilla fighters use rape and mutilation to destroy villages, attacking any woman, from tiny babies to the elderly. The level to which rape, torture and death has affected these people is unimaginable to me. I know a girl who made a documentary about all of this. If you're in the UK, you should be able to watch it [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00rvbsj/The_Worlds_Most_Dangerous_Place_for_Women/). Maybe someone more tech-savvy than I can find a way to watch it elsewhere? Here are some [links](http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/mar/28/congo-women-danger-war-judith-wanga), to newspaper [articles](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/08/AR2007090801194.html). A list of companies that use minerals mined in the East Congo can be found [here](http://www.friendsofthecongo.org/new/coltan.php). I really just want to raise awareness. That so many women could be so brutally attacked, and not have it raise outrage world-wide, is completely shattering to me. I don't know what else to do but try to let people know, and try to put some pressure on companies to source their materials ethically.Edit:Here are some ways to help. [One](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mariska-hargitay/how-we-can-all-help-women_b_502411.html), [two](http://www.runforcongowomen.org/), [three](http://www.womenforwomen.org/global-initiatives-helping-women/help-women-congo.php). I don't know all that much about Women for Women, but it seems good. [This article](http://www.msmagazine.com/spring2005/congo.asp) mentions that you can donate directly to a hospital through the [Swedish Pentecostal Mission](http://www.missioncouncil.se/%20english/members/spm_e.html) (website in Swedish, but their contact details are at the bottom of the article). You can contact the UN, and urge them to do more to help.You can raise awareness and put pressure on companies to stop using products mined in the DRC. You can tell everyone you know. Write letters to newspapers, politicians, and anyone else you can think of who could help raise awareness and make changes.  I have a Meetup in NJ that’s a supper club. Every Meetup we plan a dinner party around a theme or cuisine, and everyone brings a dish. We had a newcomer sign up tonight. She told me shortly after she arrived that she had Bell’s Palsy, which is partial paralysis of the face, and it does give her the appearance that she's had a stroke. During the conversation of the evening, she mentioned she's separated after 20+ years of marriage. Man, I just thought about how hurt and scared I felt trying to make new friends after my own separation a few years ago. And she showed up at a stranger’s house tonight for a *dinner party* with a room full of people she didn't know. That is badass.                   In those brief moments (that probably lasted less than one minute) I already imagined myself explaining the situation to my mother, the plumber, my landlord, my neighbor, and possibly the pope. I cannot be the only person who’s experienced this.            Dudebro was friends with my husband in high school and moved to our city recently, so we took him out to dinner. This was my first time meeting him. For context, my husband works in an NGO, which is honorable but the money’s not great. I work in a tech start-up. When I introduced myself and told him where I worked, he asked: “So you’re an admin there?” with the most condescending attitude. Keep in mind that by this point I hadn’t told him what my job was and my field of work. But he had to assume that I made less money than my husband (while in fact I actually make twice as much), and if I work in a tech startup it probably means that I was in an entry-level position.So I gracefully told him that I was in fact a Creative Director there. The look on his face was priceless.Edit: Added more context. Edit2: I called him a misogynist in this post because after I said I was a Creative Director there, he still managed to brush off my position a few times with comments like: "So you just sell your ideas, how hard can that be?" and "I've seen your ads, I'm not impressed." Definitely was an unpleasant evening but tbh I don't seek approval from people whose approval means nothing to me.   I’m pregt. We cannot keep it. There must have been a miscalculation on my part when switching to a new birth control. I was also smoking and drinking before realizing I was pregt. I’m starting back to grad school in the fall. He’s not where he needs to be in his career (neither am I). I do own my home, but’s it’s less than 1000sq feet and definitely not big enough for us and a baby. Regardless of the 30+ reasons, we aren’t keeping it. I have an appt in a week. However, I have had five women ask me in the last four days when my boyfriend and I are going to have kids. None of my male coworkers ask me or my boyfriend, but all of my female coworkers ask me at least once a week. People have things going on that others can’t see. My one friend has been doing fertility treatments for two years and miscarried in early 2018. My other friend found out last week that she has PCOS and her fertility levels are that of someone entering menopause. I know all women don’t do this, but it’s just a PSA. I’ve never had a man ask me when I’m having kids, but of course that doesn’t mean it has never happened. Just because someone is in a relationship or over 25 doesn’t mean they need to have kids. Or that they can. Or that they aren’t going through something surrounding it. I know people don’t mean it in a harmful way. But when a friend asked when I’m having a kid with my bf, just last week, I felt like I was going to cry.   If any women is in need of an abortion and does not have access to services, aidaccess.org will mail the abortion pill for a charitable donation of your choice. If you do not believe in a women’s right to have a medical abortion for a pregcy 10weeks and under, please continue scrolling and do no comment . I did not make this post to start a debate, but only to provide this information to women who might not have had this knowledge prior to reading this.               Even when it's not directed at me, it really makes me uncomfortable to see people over sexualizing other guys, gals and nonbinary pals. I was watching some chiropractor videos where the doctor cracks their patient's back (it's a guilty pleasure of mine - I'm terrified to make an appointment to do that so I live vicariously, I guess) and the comments on it were...less than innocent. And it just grossed me out so much that people were so outwardly salacious towards total strangers that were getting treated for pain. They were fully dressed, there was no inappropriate touching - nothing sexual about it. Yet there were still people that were describing what they would like to do to the patient and it just - ick. It's unwarranted and disgusting. And when others commented on their behaviour, they said that the people in the videos "shouldn't be wearing something so sexy." They were wearing a tank top and yoga pants. Workout clothes.There are other examples (both online and in person) I can think of, but that's what I just came from so it's the one I'm writing about. Does anyone else feel disgusted on behalf of other when they see shit like this? It like, rots my insides. **Why aren't men held equally responsible for unplanned pregcy?**   I don't ever see that come up in the topic at hand. No one talks about a solution that involves men being less careless, or more careful, or having any responsible whatsoever. At least not that I've seen. It is *always* the 'woman's fault.' Why is it the woman who takes 100% of the blame? Because she's the one who carries the child - or should I say 'proof' of the accident?  Less serious side question: Do people really believe that women are getting themselves pregt or something? Because that's what it feels like.  If this feels like it isn't a serious question then I apologize - but it burns me up thinking women always get punished or shamed for something that is half their fault, half someone else's. Someone else who conveniently can just walk away without taking any of the blame. Also, I am **not saying all men do this - I've just never witnessed a man coming out and saying; "I should have been more careful."** Or seen any other male acknowledge that fact before ruthless blasting women for either having too much sex or not taking birth control. Again, an area that is completely perceived as a woman's problem and something men don't have to worry about.  Maybe I'm just aggravated.  Retail. 200 lbs, hardly 5’2 woman. Working on weight, coming off slower than expected.So I’m at the register ringing an athletic-appearing man, he breaks the silence and we have a conversation that goes like this:Him: Did you work out today?Me: (taken back) Not today, but I should later *awkward laugh*Him: (Quote) “You look like you should”Me, completely stunned: ...Him: Come see me at the LA fitness on _______ ave sometime okay? Did cry while I got “water” in the back, manager saw, tracked him through system (he used a credit card associated with our store) and wrote in his customer profile “Rude and discourteous. DO NOT assist without notifying manager” That’s going to print on his receipt every time he makes a purchase. I feel like it’s too much. Should I attempt to pull up this guys profile and delete that? He embarrassed me but I don’t want to continuously return the favor. Advice please!                                            I’ve been far too oblivious throughout my life, to some awfully manipulative things. One of the most prominent events that still haunts me happened when I was a freshman in high school.  A guy from my class seemed to want to befriend me and I, the designated quiet person didn’t return the favor. He would constantly find me in the hallways, sit next to me in class, and tried to play with a strand of my hair. This was so uncomfortable and my teacher pointed out him playing with my hair, and I was mortified because the entire class witnessed this. One month of this fucking annoying behavior and suddenly in class he leans in like he is gonna kiss me. Obviously I move away, and pretend nothing happened while explaining some class work bullshit assignment. Immediately this fucker, announced to the whole class that I had disgusting breath. For the last couple years of my life I’ve manifested a fear of speaking close to people and constantly needing to have gum, because I believed what he said (despite asking my brutally honest siblings and mother if my breath stank and being told it didn’t) . Until 2 minutes ago when I reflected on some of the most embarrassing things in my life and realized that his pussy self couldn’t deal with rejection. Any of y’all can relate??       The 80’s got The Breakfast Club, The 90’s had Clueless, and us millennials were gifted with THE quintessential high school clique movie, the masterpiece known as Mean Girls. If you’re a fan, you know what October 3rd, otherwise known as Mean Girls Day, means to us. [https://4ormypeople.com/mood/2019/10/3/happy-october-3rd-aka-mean-girls-day](https://4ormypeople.com/mood/2019/10/3/happy-october-3rd-aka-mean-girls-day)                                            So this happened to me like a few days ago. And I need to vent .I'm upset and shocked it ended like this. It's hard finding someone that respects me enough.Matched with this guy, hit it off, we made plans to meet up in a few weeks, then things got heated later on and started talking about what we are going to do with each other.  In my particular situation I had to disclose about my hsv and he was totally fine with this. I told him protection is a must. He says he is allergic to condoms. And I'm like seriously? He's like "yeah I don't like them". So I'm like to him "so you always have unprotected sex?" ( He didn't answer me this)  I'm like what if the girl asks you to wear one?Then the smart ass was like "is this some sort of interigation?" He's like "dude I'm not a female, I haven't fucked a yacht full of people"  I was just like wow. He says he pulls out and it's fine. THEN later he was like I've never worn a condom.THENNNNN he was like "I've never worn a condom cos real sex feels better" like what the actual heck! So I was getting all these statements that don't make sense and I'm thinking how do you know if you're allergic to them!? I mean if he had a reaction with a band aid then okay (I don't know if that's the same latex reactions) but even with that, buy the type of shit that doesn't react with your skin! But holy shit, never have I clenched so much in my life reading these messages from him!! It was Soo off putting. Like he didn't say I'll wear one for you or whatever.Literally told him straight up I don't feel comfortable with this and don't see this going further now.  Blocked and deleted.I just want to share my experience, so girls don't be afraid to say what you really want to say! Don't give in because you'll end up dealing with particular consequences.                                     I just got done spending the day with a person who I had hoped to spend the rest of my life with. We both got out of toxic relationships within the past year and found solace with each other. However we are vastly different people.I was ready to commit longer term. I made it clear that I date to have a life partner. They originally were completely on board.... then the honeymoon phase was over.I could tell that they began to distance from me. And it killed. They got drunk a couple weeks ago and broke up with me but within three days said they “made a mistake.”I asked them today what they wanted, as I wanted them. And they just said “I don’t know” and I had to tell them good bye.It was probably the right thing to do for myself but I am honestly so beat up right now. I didn’t want to break up with them- I just need to be wanted, obviously and overtly by my partner.I don’t really know if this is the right place to put this. I just miss them already. I think I made the right choice for me, but I really do love them. This hurts.    She loved dedications, so here's a short piece meant to let the world know how incredible a person she was:[https://medium.com/@\_chrismarin/remembering-genevieve-comeau-62f8cd30f5fd?source=friends\_link&sk=b1a94c69bd92631b61001c03c122704e](https://medium.com/@_chrismarin/remembering-genevieve-comeau-62f8cd30f5fd?source=friends_link&sk=b1a94c69bd92631b61001c03c122704e)  If you're unable to open the article, or it's hidden behind some paywall, here's a Google doc of the same content: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DE0mc9fk\_BjQ6WPJDNydXxOpCFMVMKKSRNFnc3OYQUw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DE0mc9fk_BjQ6WPJDNydXxOpCFMVMKKSRNFnc3OYQUw/edit?usp=sharing)  If you or anyone you know may be a victim of domestic violence:• Contact police• Seek medical attention• Call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 800–799–7233• Go to an assistance organization such as Safe Alliance                   This happens so often but today's comment really got to me.

Men (usually older but not always) always make sexual jokes which make me feel really awkward and inhibit me from chatting with them.An older guy made a joke today saying "No kisses today, I have a cold."I get that he's harmless but it makes me feel so icky. I laugh along but I really want to ask him why he thinks it's appropriate to say that. I just don't understand how it's funny??? Sorry just needed a rant So let me start by saying I am a 23 year old trans woman, who’s been out since June of last year. Currently I live in a sober living house with 12 men, and me. I was given the ability to live here since technically I am biologically male and when I moved in I was at a point in my transition where I didn’t feel comfortable enough to move into women’s housing, and I didn’t want to make anyone else uncomfortable either. I am currently four months on HRT, and doing well, and I’ve made good progress in finding what it means to me to be a woman, and who I am as a woman. But living in this space has been a struggle. I have very few women in my life, which isn’t the norm as all my life my friend groups have been only women. And I at times find myself becoming a “man hater”. Hearing the way these men sexualize women, judge their beauty and emotional issues, and all sorts of look based standards they share with each other. It’s really toxic for someone like me to hear, especially since I’m not only struggling with normal appearance based self esteem but also my gender dysphoria. I wish I could move out but I am ficially unable to do so at this time. It’s just hard, and this post was more of a mini vent. At times, I make so much progress in my confidence and how I view myself, but others I get down on myself and feel like I should dress more “feminine” or wear more makeup or show more skin to be valued by men. But I remind myself that’s stupid, and changing who I am because of what men find attractive is disingenuous and wouldn’t build real self esteem. Im not sure what I’m looking for exactly, just someone to hear me out and if anyone else has dealt with this sort of thing, obviously most of you aren’t trans but I’m sure you can relate in other ways.Thank you.   So, I [29F-Australian] just arrived in Madagascar today for a work trip. I am hear a bit early to get prepared for the conference and see some sights. I am staying at a place conveniently close to the airport and the owner (and guide) asked me if I wanted to go see some local lemurs. Of course, as any natural history enthusiast would, I agreed to go. He started getting uncomfortablely close to me when we were walking and went in for a hug a few times. I mostly swerved out of the way or avoided him, but once, when I ducked away his finger got caught on the corner of my mouth and, instead of moving, he ...dug it in...like a fishhook and I couldn't move my head out of it. I had to physically pull his hand off me.And, in the process, I nearly bit the damn thing off. So, ladies, wtf.!  I'm so angry. Can't women go anywhere without the constant assault on our bodies?!  I’m almost 22 and have been using pads since I was like 10. Been terrified of tampons.Well today I put one in and yeah I’m still scared of it getting stuck up there or something but it’s so cool how I can’t feel it at all. I have no one to talk to about this so... FUCKING FINALLY!!!!!          I usually love singing along with his songs and rarely pay attention to lyrics but this one caught me. I mean, if this is a song about his life, not starting out well calling women btches. And then talking about looking for a woman to fix him. Dude... fix your own shit. IF this is your life and you're needing someone else to fix your shit for you? That's sad. What you need is a mom apparently, since you're being too enfantile to handle your own shit. Putting all your responsibility on your partner to get your shit together? That's some bullshit. Okay.. just a random rant as it's been bugging me.                   A while back I got sized and learned I've been wearing a bra much too small for me. Months later I finally got around to ordering a new bra. Received it today, just put it on. Holy crap I am so comfortable! I never knew how bad the old bra was!Its like someone wrapped my boobs in a soft blanket and said *"Shhhh, shhh... it's okay, you're home now, you're gonna be alright..."*I'm sorry if this is a dumb post, I'm just so amazed at the difference and I had no one to share it with. Carry on!      These past few weeks I've been really bothered by how physically weak I am compared to the average man. I've been working out for about a year and started taking Krav Maga classes (self defense/martial art) a few months ago. However, my boyfriend is shorter than me and has never been in a fight in his life, yet he could easily overpower me if he wanted to. I've been getting really upset about this. I'm not sure if this is some kind of inferiority complex or manifestation of past trauma. For some context, my father was abusive and I've been sexually harassed so much, the worst instance being a group of boys threatening to rape me when I was in high school. I just can't stand the fact that a man can do whatever he wants to me because he's so much stronger. I'm sorry if there's a better subreddit to post this on. I'm just wondering if anyone knows a way I can deal with this. Thanks in advance.                               I am the male manage a business with a tampon machine in our ladies room. I'm not sure what absorbancy would be the right ones to stock in the machine? Also, is their a preferred brand? We have always used the Tampax in the cardboard tubes, but my understanding is these are not the preference for many women. It may also be these are the only option available.                        I met my husband almost 10 years ago - we were both in our 20's. I had two kids already, but was in good physical shape. He was always a big bear type guy, tall and soft, but not fat. His friends made comments about how I was cute, and I could tell he felt proud to be with me. Fast forward 10 years. He lost 40lbs, and looks good. Men, I think, tend to age better anyway, so his grey hairs just make him look hotter to me, and now he's all fit looking too. Me? I'm about 25lbs overweight. We had two more kids, and my body owns motherhood on every inch of it, from my tired eyes, to my doughy center, to my half painted toenails. I'm suddenly embarrassed to be seen with my husband. I don't want his friends to see pictures of me. I know what people are thinking when they see us together... How did she get a guy like that? He could do so much better. She must have been pretty when she was younger and just let herself go. I feel this sense of being an utter disappointment. Worthless. I make twice his salary. I am strong and loving and carry our household on my shoulders. I raise our 4 boys. I take care of all the details. I cook wonderful meals. I am kind to his family. We laugh together and we like all the same things. I should be proud of me, proud of everything I've accomplished, and everything I do. But I'm not - so much of my self worth is tied in to the size of the pants I'm wearing. I'm not worthy of my babe of a husband, because I'm fat fatty fat fat. Because I'm not pretty enough for him now. Why? Why do we go along with this? Why do we think this way? I just wanted to find some place to get this out of my head. Thanks for reading. tl;dr - I'm amazed by how our fluctuating body sizes have impacted the way I feel about being with my husband over the past decade. Now that I'm fat and he's thin, I feel unworthy despite having built a very happy and successful life together.      Again please delete if it violates the rules. First time on this sub. And I have a question that the responses might have triggering stuff so I wanted to put a trigger warning.Has anyone else ever slept with someone because they felt like if they didn’t that person would just rape them anyway? And at least that way you’d at least could kinda pretend that you wanted to do it and not be someone who went through this traumatic thing. I’ve just been thinking a lot about myself and my experiences and I just feel like a large majority of the people I have slept with I did so because o got the vibe that they would hurt me and/or rape me anyways.    small titty gals being able to spend $5 and get a cute bra from target meanwhile I have to pay $100+ to get any sort of bra because of my G cup behemoth monster titties. And you know that shit gonna be beige because no way any big titty binch wants to look cute, we only want to look like a dead ass grandma. People telling me to free the nipple not knowing my boobz look like they’ve breastfeed fifteen starving children and I’m only 20 years old. Bra companies got that big tit monopoly locked down knowing there ain’t no way I’m leaving da house swinging my chest goblins free with no bra. They know imma still pay $100. Slave to the titty.                                Both the Dutch and the USA Teams are great, should be a good game over coffee! You’re not being too hard on him.Don’t sacrifice your standards for his comfort.          So, long story short, I ended up down the rabbit hole and found r/incenst. NO, I do not partake in that. I was looking at a post about creepiest subreddits, and happened to click on that because I couldn't believe what people were saying.Well, big surprise, the first post I clicked was about a dude trying to screw his mom, who has a low IQ (ironically). Long story short, she feels pressured and gives in, but the son can tell she is uncomfortable (big surprise). The mom won't kiss him and is apparently very uncomfortable/disgusted. The OP then says that he touched her down there and she was 'wet.'So now he's going in the comments trying to make himself feel better about still pursuing trying to screw his own mother. And the post is FILLED with men saying, "Ohh, the body knows what the body wants. If she was wet, she wants it. It's just society saying it's bad, which is why she feels conflicted"LIKE NO THAT IS NOT FREAKING TRUE. THAT'S NOT HOW ANY OF THIS WORKS. Even men can become hard during unwanted advances. It's an uncontrollable physical response!!!! I did what I could and posted to every comment about the mom being wet and wanting it and saying that's not how it works. I also told the OP as well because he apparently also thought this was true. Jesus christ, what did my eyes see. If you want, I'm sure you could go find the post and also kindly let these fools know about female anatomy, and also their own male anatomy. But I just needed to vent. This type of ignorance is just dangerous.       I'm writing a one woman show and I'm looking for everyday sexist things that don't seem sexist but are, ESPECIALLY to women on tills or in the work place. Thanks  I swear to god, the pain is so intense, I want to cry. I’ve tried everything from midol, heating pads to ibuprofen, but it hurts so muchI have implanon but it just won’t stop hurting, What can I do to make it hurt less? Had another classic date last night. A blind date, this time set up by a college sister to fill an extra ticket for the Opera. What could go wrong? He walked 6 steps ahead of me the whole time and answered each question in single syllables. After interrogating my academic, social, religious and work pedigrees, he took to checking his phone constantly, texting away, googling here & there, when, then, he turned, looked me in the eyes, and said  'Can you get me in touch with Sharon Stone?'   I lied. I said 'Yes I can'.   He needed her to speak at a conference featuring himself as the keynote speaker in 5 weeks, no less...  'Could You ask her?"I said 'No That is why she has an agent. I know her socially. Call her agent. You can Google it.'   And that he did, right there, at the opera, she wanting $30K to speak 20 minutes, he rebuking. We watched the first act. He put his phone on night mode and kept texting, and then complained in a toff that he was bored at the first intermission.   I asked him, 'Do you want to go to your apartment?'  He said 'Yes.'  I ushered him outside the opera house while ordering a Lyft, and when it arrived, he opened the door and leapt in before me to discover, much to his own surprise, he was heading home alone. I double-backed into the Opera House and made the second and third acts! I had a nice time. Incredulously, he texted me an asked me out for breakfast this morning. I didn't want to see him lick his knife in a restaurant, so I lied again and told him I was at the Gym.   It was 5:10 AM.m lick his knife in a restaurant, so I lied again and told him I was at the Gym. It was 5:10 AM.                [https://www.kinder-world.org/articles/solutions/meet-jeanne-darc-girubuntu-rwandas-first-female-pro-cyclist-19369](https://www.kinder-world.org/articles/solutions/meet-jeanne-darc-girubuntu-rwandas-first-female-pro-cyclist-19369)                          It was around 11 pm and I was searching for a place to sit on the train. There weren't a lot of people, but while I was walking throug the aisle, a man came in the opposite direction. It was a small passage so we both went out of our way to let each other through. He signed that I should pass, so I walked on. When I passed him, he kind of 'petted' my butt. I didn't realize what was happening at first. He just walked further and mumbled something unintelligible. After a couple of seconds I realized what happened and stopped to look confused and angry at him, but he was already gone. I got scared, but moved on to find a seat while my heart was still racing. The train car I was seated in, was empty and after a couple of minutes the same man came back and placed himself across me. He started to speak, but I couldn't understand it because I just yelled 'no' and ran into another car. I kept on going till I found some other guy where I could sit close, but not with, to. The first man didn't follow me (I think), but when I had to switch trains I was so scared that something was going to happen there or on the other train I had to get on. I don't know what I expect from posting this, but it just keeps on running through my mind. I know things could have been way worse and maybe I don't even have the right to complain, but I think it is this 'worse' part that I'm so scared of. I feel scared when I'm on a train late at night. I feel scared when walking alone late at night. I feel angry that he thought he had the right to touch me like that.I feel mad that things like these still happen.I feel mad that I didn't do something like report it to the train staff and that it is now too late to do something about it. I feel mad that I had to go sit with another guy in order to feel a little safer.I feel mad that he makes me mistrust men a lot more than before. I am mad that he makes me feel scared.I feel completely powerless. Sorry if this post is inappropriate. I just want other women's thoughts on this as I have no one in my life who I can talk with about this. I'm F20. I am kind of cringing in asking this very basic question but I thought reddit might be a good place cause of it's anonymity. Sorry if this post makes you uncomfortable.  I have been masturbating for as far as I can remember. But I don't know if what I feel at the end of each session is an orgasm.I feel these vibrations and contractions in my body and I feel good.... But not like fireworks going in my brain like I've read on the Internet.I recently got into my first serious relationship where I am comfortable enough to be sexual with him. We have had sex a couple of times but I am not able to orgasm. My question is: What does cumming actually feel like for a woman?How do I know if I am cumming / or if I have cummed before?  I work in a compliance/risk related department in a large corporation and I recently attended a seminar about the top risks American companies face and the #1 was “sexual harassment/assault.” The hosts mentioned “The MeToo movement has changed the environment of the workplace and now we need to be aware of the consequences.” The hosts constantly talked about how leaks and lawsuits can cost the company millions of dollars and damage their reputation substantially. But no one ever said we should prevent sexual harassment/assault just because it’s literally the right thing to do? Frustrated that I had to sit through a group of men AND women talk about how this stuff is only recently important because we don’t wanna be trending on Twitter...        I posted over a year ago that I was pressing charges against a woman that assaulted me while I was drunk at a fourth of July party. I was met with a lot of skepticism from people on reddit and even people around me. It was rough. A lot of times people asked "does that even count?" Either people don't believe a woman can rape someone or they just don't want to believe that bad things happen. Either way this has been the worst experience of my life and a dark mark in my military experience.  I've since gotten out of the military while she still serves. Her court marshal was scheduled for 16 February and this weekend I have just heard from the prosecution that she had submitted a guilty plea. I felt so many things when I heard the news. I was relieved. So relieved that I wouldn't have to subject myself to any more of the defenses disection of my life to try and prove that I am a lesbian or that I wanted it. But I was also really emotional because it felt like everything that I have been through with this case just seemed to all rush back. Either way, she admitted guilt. She won't serve in my military anymore and she won't lead soldiers ever again.  I won't have to justify myself anymore because my assailant openly admitted guilt. That is the most validating part of this whole thing. She admitted what she did was wrong. I tried to link my previous post to this one but I couldn't figure it out on my phone.  Sorry!  Thanks for reading my rant! It helps to get it all out. I'm just so happy it's over.        The other night I asked my boyfriend to leave and told him that I didn't want to be together anymore.    He would gaslight me durring arguments and I would always let it go because I was afriad I was  overreacting. I couldn't handle it anymore when we were fighting when he started accusing me of only saying and thinking badly of him because of things that were being fed to me by my friends and family. "I can't beleive how fucking weak you are. Weak in the head" he said. Fuck him, I'll show him how "weak" I am, goodbye haha. Anyway Im sad and shits hard but im trying haha. Im basically making this post to vent and to tell you not to let people say your crazy/weak/ridiculous/overemotional when your upset by thier behaviors. Sorry for grammer/spelling im on my phone :P       It's the mentality.Recently I participated in an innocent "Survivor" prediction game at work. There are about 15 contestants out of which you have to predict 2 winners. I watched the episode and it was pretty obvious that joe was the strongest so I listed it as my prediction. Pretty easy to name the strongest contestant out of 15 right? But apparently not for me. I heard murmurs around me doubting my choice or more so, whether it was a coincidence that I picked the same name this other man did. Why?It has been the story of my life, literally. Let me preface it by saying- I am a 26 year old Indian girl born and raised in India. All my life, the choices I make, the opinions I hold and the decision I take have been doubted solely because of my gender. My parents raised my sister and me in the most progressive environment ever. My father refused to even talk about my marriage to anyone until my (first) Masters degree (shocking to most of my relatives). He used to send us out to buy medicines after 8pm in the isolated streets of the city of Ahmedabad, which by Indian city safety time limits  bordered on unsafe. Some people would question that. My sister and I used to complain about it not because we cared about our safety but because we would miss our favorite tv show. Now that we think about it, we realize that it was just one of the hundred lessons he taught us- lessons on how to be fearless. How women and men have the equal rights to do anything at any fucking time of the day. My sister and I were raised in a male dominated world to its truest sense. Be it the apartments we lived or the relatives we interacted with. As two young girls living in apartment # 4, we were subjected to numerous blank calls, prank calls where guys would just threaten us about coming over to our place, ghost knocks on the door and the likes. In each and every situation, our father taught us this- be bold and face it. Never ever be afraid. My sister used to take it a different level - yelling. She yelled at anyone who cat called at her. Her guards were so up that once she yelled at a guy for merely staring at her for a second more than the normal glance duration. She is the fearless one.  I, on the other hand, was or still am the more subdued one. I never raised my voice and only turned my face the other way.The more I write about this, the more suppressed memories of severe gender based discrimination are resurfacing in my head. I remember how folks from my mom's family used to constantly nag my sister about marriage while she had not even finished her bachelors degree. There were 3 much older boys in the family at a more "marriageable" age but oh no, it was the mentality. I remember once waiting at the bus stop for my college bus to arrive in the morning. Just then, a guy in ragged clothes walked up next to me and began staring at me. I gave him a cold look hoping that he would look away but instead he put his hand in his pants. Luckily, my bus arrived just then but it ruined my entire day (or maybe that week). Recently, I pulled my Prius into the parking lot in my apartment and a middle aged man walked up to me and asked me if I was driving with my handbrake on. Who the hell are you? Why the fuck do you care? Would he have made this same comment to another man in my shoes? Probably, not.I have lost count of the numerous days that have been ruined by idiots like these - rich or poor, sophisticated or crude, men with this mentality are everywhere in their disguises."So what exactly did they ask you in your interview with  one of The Big Four? It seems that the questions were very easy" Because I - a 21 year old girl got the job. Oh it's not "UC Berkeley computer science, it's that new department they just launched. Heard a lot of girls getting into such schools to become project managers". "So you're interested in MBA? I'm assuming HR because that's what girls with an MBA do" "Wow you got a job at High Tech being a 26 year old woman? Oh as a project manager, that's easy. I heard getting into engineering is the toughest". One of my girlfriends said "I used some really complicated jargon in the email so that the guys would show some interest since their brains love solving complicated things."Please, stop. Ladies and gentlemen, change your mentality, your beliefs, your biases, your perspective. Stop following and exacerbating the established societal rules around gender. Stop and rethink. We stopped uncontrollable facial hair growth and started shaving, for a reason. We started braiding our hair, for a reason. We started wearing warm clothes in winter and loose clothes in summer, for a reason. Then why haven't we adapted to the changing social environments - where men and women are at equal footing to do whatever they want. Why do girls like me , especially from countries like India, have to tolerate this bull shit all their lives. Why do we have to yell about gender equality all the fucking time? Please, for the sake of humanity, change your mentality. Make a conscious effort. Do not ignore.I am writing this from California at 1.30am in the night. I want to go to sleep but I can't. Because I live in a frustrating world where I am scared to go back to my country. I am disgusted by the men who will ogle at me the moment I step out of the airport. And more frustrated when I'm advised to ignore them. I don't want to be the subdued one anymore. I want to be bold and fearless like my sister. Like my father. Like my mother. This note is my first step in that direction.    I have a guy friend who wanted to get a vasectomy. He's 27, single, lives alone, is of average income, works with kids and is nice. He goes to the doctor and gets a vasectomy, no big deal. Everyone is happy.I have a girl friend who wants to become permanently sterile. She's 23, single,  has insurance and is covered. She has gone to 4 different doctors, all refused to do the procedure, all basically telling her what they think is best for her body and giving her other options to chose from.How does this shit still happen in America? I know a vasectomy is reversible and the female equivalent isn't, but I was under the impression that men and women were equal in terms of methods chosen to not get pregt. Any advice for the girl so she can get sterilized?           Of course there’s an askreddit thread about how leggings attract male attention.I’m so tired. I basically exclusively wear black leggings or tight black pants. They go with everything. They make my lazy flannel/sweatshirt/tunic wardrobe look intentional and slightly more professional. They tuck into my boots with zero effort. they don’t get caught on anything at work, they don’t stain, I can wash them however i want.I don’t fucking get why skinny pants have led to men losing their absolute minds. I feel sick knowing I’m sexualized at work in a big t shirt, black apron, and the same pants I wear every day.Do we blame the last scene of Grease? Is there anything in that sweet gray area of comfort and acceptable to be seen in public that is just clothing to men? Am I ever going to be allowed to just exist?Oh, and don’t get me started on what has happened since I stopped wearing underwire bras. Check out this dress researchers Made:  [https://qz.com/quartzy/1477709/oglivys-smart-dress-shows-how-often-women-are-groped-at-clubs/?utm\_source=email&utm\_medium=daily-brief&fbclid=IwAR3eavebq6wW9XdZ\_EcyV8ezladgVIEmWOnyEavS1Jnvh6Phjq1VQBSjO8Q](https://qz.com/quartzy/1477709/oglivys-smart-dress-shows-how-often-women-are-groped-at-clubs/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=daily-brief&fbclid=IwAR3eavebq6wW9XdZ_EcyV8ezladgVIEmWOnyEavS1Jnvh6Phjq1VQBSjO8Q) I apologize in advance, this will be long, emotionally charged and nostalgic. Like many middle-aged people (am a 52 year old man), I use Facebook as a way of touching base, and of passing idle time. I have a bunch of FB friends; some from various schools I have attended, some from work, some from organizations I've joined over the years, some family, and some fellow hobbyists.Last week, out of the relative blue I got a friend request from a HS girlfriend. Of all of my early life relationships she was "the one" that loomed the largest. Our relationship ended mostly because of circumstance (long story, and beside my point here).When she friended me, she had some words for me that seemed odd: that she wasn't sure I would accept her friend request, or that other friends of ours from HS would accept. She and I had gotten into some trouble (trouble that seems like pretty small potatoes now) when we were together. It was serious HS D-R-A-M-A. She was convinced that we would all still care about that.We were on a school trip together, and travelled together by train with a teacher and a few other students. While on the trip, we got caught fooling around. A few of the other students ratted us out. When we got back, my girlfriend was summarily booted out of National Honor Society after a "we can do this the easy way, or do this the hard way" conference with the HS principal. She had been the NHS president. In terms of HS honors, that was a pretty big one. There was lots of shaming language, and meetings with both of our parents. She was made to feel like a murderer or something. I was only at this school for a year. Basically nothing happened to me at all.The one exception to all the "you are sinners" talk was one of our English teachers. He defended us, albeit briefly. He described our relationship as one of real love, and that it was beautiful. He cautioned the other adults about trampling something so obviously real. He was ignored. I've never forgotten his words.When my OGF (old girlfriend) called me, she had been agonizing over this incident for decades. She was convinced that other people remembered this incident, and felt deep shame over the entire thing. She "let all those people down" and felt as if, even through the lens of decades, that they'd still see her as having done something wrong. I reassured her: people would want to hear from you. They would want to know what's going on in your life. I explained the concept of "slut-shaming", and that we had nothing about which to be ashamed. We were kids. We loved each other. We expressed that physically as humans have been doing since there were humans. We weren't dishonest or disrespectful, we didn't steal, cheat or otherwise comport ourselves in any way that reflected badly on us. Instead, she got trampled by some administrators intent on keeping a good woman in her "place".There were no consequences for me in that incident. I had never felt a minute of shame about it. At worst, we chose the place where we fooled around badly. She had truly internalized the shaming talk from decades ago. Because she was much more traditionally religious than I ever had been, she hadn't really heard about "slut-shaming". Her first reaction on hearing the term was "Was I a slut? Did people think that about me?" Ugh.By the end of our talk, I think I helped her find a measure of peace, and helped her release some of the shame. I wish she had reached out to me sooner than she did; we did nothing shameful. It kind of hurts me that she carried that with her alone. I have had nothing but good feelings and memories about her and our relationship. Until I spoke to her that day, I had no idea that this kind of bullshit societal shaming of women could be so freaking powerful, and that it could last decades.I am sorry that men (or at least this man) can be so dumb. I hope I helped my old friend find some peace. I hope maybe some of you can feel that peace too.TL;DR HS GF was slut shamed. Tried to convince her that she is awesome, and we were awesome, and not to be ashamed. Hope it worked.                    That’s it. It makes no sense how we as a species just can not grasp the idea that if it’s another human, you just don’t touch without consent. The sexiest woman on earth can be walking naked down the street and there’s absolutely 100% not a singular reason on this planet that would justify groping her or advancing sexually or trying to grab, kiss, squeeze, cop a feel, or touch in any way with sexual intent. Literally how is this hard to understand? I know as a kid I was ALWAYS told “look but don’t touch” to the point of clarity where now as an adult I still subconsciously walk around stores with like a religious fever against touching anything unless I’m directly putting it into my shopping cart. This is not a difficult concept to teach people. How do we still not understand, it doesn’t matter how provoking they are or how desperate you are, YOU DONT INVITE YOURSELF TO SOMEONE ELSE’S BODY.                Currently on the floor of my apartment half-dressed after having finally left the bathroom and I’m thoroughly miserable. The pain gets so bad that I truly want to die      I have strong opinions on the Kavanaugh situation. Even before these allegations I didn't believe he was worthy of confirmation to the Supreme Court, now that is unquestionable. I believe Ford is telling the truth and after watching his testimony I can't imagine why anyone would believe he is the right man for the job. But there's one greater social point that needs to be made in all this drama. Many men see themselves in Kavanaugh. They did stupid things in high school, they have nights they don't remember. They fear that if Kavanaugh has to answer for his past, they may have to one day answer for theirs. Their fear of what might come blinds them to the reality faced by many women. We are Christine Blasey Ford. We fear the consequences of your actions, so we don't tell anyone of our pain. We fear we won't be believed, that we'll be called liars and sluts. We fear that we'll make ourselves vulnerable and justice will never be served. We fear that our pain is not worth our abuser's discomfort. We worry about his family. We fear putting ourselves in situations where we might become victims. We fear them not only for the violence of the act, but also for how we will handle the aftermath.Men fear a possible future, women live with their fears in the present.                I'm including the NY Times story for those who don't subscribe because I believe it is important for all women to know: African-American, Native American and Alaska Native women die of pregcy-related causes at a rate about three times higher than those of white women, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Tuesday.The racial disparity has persisted, even grown, for years despite frequent calls to improve access to medical care for women of color. Sixty percent of all pregcy-related deaths can be prevented with better health care, communication and support, the researchers concluded.“Ensuring quality care for mothers throughout their pregcies and postpartum should be among our nation’s highest priorities,” said Dr. Robert R. Redfield, director of the C.D.C.“I urge the public health community to increase awareness with all expectant and new mothers about the signs of serious pregcy complications and the need for preventive care that can and does save lives.”Maternal health among black women has emerged as an issue in the 2020 presidential campaign. Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, and Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, have both raised the glaring racial discrepancy in maternal outcomes on the campaign trail.“Everyone should be outraged this is happening in America,” Ms. Harris said on Twitter, blaming the deaths on racial bias in the health system.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which was not involved in the C.D.C. report, recently acknowledged that racial bias within the health care system is contributing to the disproportionate number of pregcy-related deaths among minority women.“We are missing opportunities to identify risk factors prior to pregcy, and there are often delays in recognizing symptoms during pregcy and postpartum, particularly for black women,” Dr. Lisa Hollier, immediate past president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a statement.The United States has an abysmal record on maternal health, compared with other high-income countries. Even as maternal death rates fell by more than one-third from 2000 to 2015 across the world, outcomes for American mothers worsened, according to Unicef.The C.D.C. examined pregcy-related deaths in the United States from 2011 to 2015, and also reviewed more detailed data from 2013 to 2017 provided by 13 states’ maternal mortality review committees.The agency found that black women were 3.3 times more likely than white women to suffer a pregcy-related death; Native American and Alaska Native women were 2.5 times more likely to die than white women.Obstetric emergencies involving complications like severe bleeding caused most of the deaths at delivery. But cardiovascular disease — not typically associated with a young pregt women — was a leading cause of pregcy-related deaths.Heart disease and strokes caused more than one-third of pregcy-related deaths, the C.D.C. found. Cardiac disease, which disproportionately affects black women, may be present in a woman before pregcy, but it also can be acquired during pregcy, which doctors say acts as a sort of a “stress test.”If heart disease goes undetected, it may become acute after the baby is born. Indeed, a greater proportion of the deaths among black women occurred in the later postpartum period, between seven weeks and a year after the delivery, compared with white women, the C.D.C. found.“When we look at the proportion of pregcy related deaths by cause, the proportion due to cardiomyopathy has been increasing,” said Dr. Hollier. “It can occur in all women, but it is more common among black women.”One of the surprises in the new report was how often death occurred after childbirth. More than half of pregcy-related deaths occurred after the day of the delivery, and the heightened risk to a new mother persisted for as long as a year.Concern about high pregcy-related death rates among black women has already resulted in some changes in policy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists this week released new guidelines for treating heart disease during pregcy.The standard postpartum doctor visit for new mothers is typically scheduled for six weeks after delivery. The group now says that postpartum care should be an ongoing process, rather than a single appointment, and that services and support should be tailored to the woman’s individual needs.Women should have some contact with a care provider within the first three weeks postpartum, and a comprehensive visit no later than 12 weeks after birth. Women who qualify for Medicaid, the government health care program for low income people, because they’re pregt often lose coverage sixty days after giving birth.The C.D.C. found that 18.5 percent of pregcy-related deaths occurred one to six days postpartum, and that 21.4 percent of these deaths occurred between the seventh and 42nd days after delivery.A new federal law, the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act, provides grants to states that investigate pregcy-related deaths, including deaths occurring up to a year after the birth. They tolerate little kids, sure there's some bias but its not that bad. But sometime after hitting puberty, that bias changes, mutates and grows into a strange combination of hate, lust, a desperation to dominate at all costs, and a belief that they are the rightful controllers. And we're suddenly back to being slaves in our own countries, sometimes well kept slaves who are treated with patronising politeness on the surface, but still, slaves not worth the same as they are. They're worth everything and we should be grateful they're even letting us into the workforce, us with our pretty little heads filled with nothing, because everyone knows we don't really have anything going on in our noggins."I mean, let's be real, women are nice and all but you never find a woman who's properly equal to a man".But when we try to grow muscles, dad says no man will marry you, you'll die alone and ugly. And if I say okay, Im fine with dying alone, I get beaten, strangled, hated by other men and women at work, sabotaged,.raped, locked up at home for months, have the money I earned taken away, and can't go for interviews. I can't even beg for a laptop. I'm a slave again. It's 1649 again, and men have the right to slap a girl who wants freedom again.       This is a bit of a rant, but I feel like a lot of women can relate. All my life I’ve been told the world is a dangerous place for women. I’m not saying it isn’t but I shouldn’t be told I can’t go and do thing just because I was born a woman. So, I’m a grew up near a small town, and now I’m out of the house going to collage. My parents can be pretty protective of me and sometimes it feels like they wanna keep me in a little bubble away from the world. Now that I’m a full grown adult, I’m trying to get out of that small bubble that they’ve been keeping me in. My parents always tell me I don’t have any street smarts to go to the city. Well, Today for the first time ever I went to Toronto on my own, to get art supplies I needed for school. And surprise! I was fine, I wasn’t mugged, raped kidnaped, or murdered. The worst that happened, was some dude followed me for a block trying to talk to me. I was aware of my surroundings, I noticed him sizing me up, i knew that he was following me and trying to talk to me. So I kept walking towards a more crowded area and ignored him, until he went away. But, nooooo, I don’t have any street smarts, I must continue to live in fear.  Not to mention I made sure to leave Toronto well before sunset because, well that’s conmen sense. My parents called me later on, and I told them of my perilous journey to Toronto as a woman. They where horrified and worried. They told me never to go into Toronto alone again. They repeated the same nonsense of how in danger I am and I don’t know how to handle myself in the city. Yeah fuck that I’m a strong independent woman, and from now on I wanna go to Toronto whenever I feel like it and enjoy myself doing it!     I just finished this book and HOLY FUCKING HELL!!I mean ya sure, I know that the world is biased towards men, duh. But holy shit this book! The information the author, Caroline Criado Perez pulls together! I cannot recommend this book enough. It is just infuriating and maddening and so damned important. And just so eye-opening! Things I had never even thought about like transportation and things I took for granted as being properly researched for women like, medication... Just WOW. Yesterday was International’s Women’s day. I had my first smear test. My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. When we both met up after our appointments we sat and laughed at the irony. Being a woman is never easy. We usually have the hardships of always being the empathetic one, so when we don’t react the way we’re expected to, we’re hysterical. Society expects us to do twice the work of men but for half the pay. Hard working women get given the ‘invisible work’ of keeping a home fully stocked and clean, looking after the kids and still expected to look beautiful throughout. When we’re in pain, we soldier on because people rely on us 24/7. Now I’m not saying that this is exclusively for women. There are some wonderful men out there breaking those sexist barriers and doing everything a woman does. Unfortunately the majority of society has not caught up with them.Being a woman is still never easy, but we are strong. We can overcome anything. We can make it through this. Ok, I’ve finished my ranting, thank you for reading <3                    I’ve never posted here so I’m sorry if this goes against any of the rules, I just want to rant and hear if anyone else has experienced something similar.I’m going to preface this by saying there isn’t really a happy ending. I’m a woman in my mid twenties living in a country where I am a minority but speak the language at a native level.Like always I was going to work by train in the morning and decided to line up in a different area than usual, not realizing I was in the wrong spot to line up as I was the first in line (we usually form 2 rows to get on the train, I noticed people lining up beside me but not that there was no one behind me , hence why I didn’t think anything of it). The train came and as I was about to board (after two or three people had already gotten on) I was pulled back by some guy I don’t know who had grabbed my shoulder and backpack who was now screaming at me “if you can’t follow rules go back to your own country you ugly girl!!’ Not just once, he was screaming nonstop so in the heat and shock of the moment I first responded by yelling back that I had made a mistake. But he wouldn’t stop even once I got on the train so I gave him the finger and yelled at him to fuck off. At this point many people are starring but no one is intervening as this guy is screaming at me to go back to my country repeatedly from the platform. Coming to the realization that this guy 1) put his hands on me and 2) was definitely going to do something like this again to someone else, I got off the train and flagged over station staff. I could barely get a word in with this guy screaming, but I was able to get them to call the police for me.Here’s where this gets even more frustrating.The police show up (6 men) and act like I’m the bad guy, they wanted to see my status card (like a green card) which I didn’t have with me which apparently is bad, I didn’t know, so I had my husband bring it for me. No matter how many times I explain to the police what happen they kinda laugh it off and are like well you weren’t lined up properly and that guy says he barely touched you (this idiot ADMITTED to putting his hands on me) and yet they kept saying things like well you yelled back (once after being assaulted) so it was a fight and he says it was he unladylike of you to give him the finger so can you just let it go? Afterwards I found out that they had also lied to my husband (from the country we live in, not really important but we do get weird treatment being a biracial couple) saying that I was the one who started it by giving the guy the finger and that it was my fault for not being lined up for the train properly. They kept telling me to let it go and now being extremely stressed and late for work I agreed but I feel awful. Somewhere while this was happening the police told me to use the women’s only train cars but how is that the issue?? That’s like saying if you don’t want to get assaulted run away from all men because it’s your responsibility??? Not to mention we don’t have these cars at all times so what do you do when you have to ride with everyone? Just suck it up and go oh well, hope I don’t get assaulted by some crazy unstable person today lol!!I can’t get the incident out of my head. I feel like the country I live in hates women (and foreigners too) and it’s frustrating when the system won’t help you. I agreed to let it go yesterday but I am considering going today to try and file a report (which I didn’t yesterday because the police talked me out of it). Has anyone here experienced anything like this? Sorry to rant for so long but I just wanted a safe space to share this. Thanks for reading.Edit:Thanks for the supportive comments, I’m sorry for all the similar things you’ve experienced but there’s something so validating hearing that I’m not alone.To everyone asking where this took place, it was in Japan. Also an update, my husband and I went to the police today to see if I could do anything but they all except one guy basically scoffed at me and said I can’t do anything because I agreed to let it go. They also proceeded to tell me that being grabbed from behind and pulled so hard I almost fell back doesn’t count as assault because I guess it’s not assault unless you maim a person...Really aggravating too because I speak at a native level and yet people (lets be honest, only men) still like to treat me like I don’t based on appearance only. For example, the cop who I was having a conversation with laughed and asked if I understood what he was saying after I paused dumbfounded at the sexism I was bombarded with, and when I was explaining my side of the story to the police yesterday when it happened, the guy was screaming beside me to go home if I can’t speak Japanese (regardless of speaking perfectly, like the equivalent of somebody telling you to speak your own language because they’re stupid I guess?)I don’t know if this update was anything other than my rant just dragging on but no happy ending, I’ll post another update should I run into the assaulter again as we share the same closest station so I’m pretty sure he lives near me (yaayyyy /s).Thanks for reading until the end.  Basically told me tough luck and went about their business. Guy appeared drunk. He went in the bathroom and proceeded to look into each stall before trying to bust into mine so I opened it as he was trying to bust it open and tazed his neck. I called the police and they did nothing but let him go home smh I’m missing a few details because I’m nervous and shaking   I moved to the east side of Des Moines, Iowa about a year and a half ago. I go on walks a lot and it is my favorite form of exercise because I love birds and bird watching. I used to be catcalled all the time when I lived in the suburbs. Usually by younger high school age guys. Once I moved to the east side nobody catcalled me for about a year and a half. I figured it was because nobody wanted to fuck with anyone and get shot or something similar. I typically carry two knives on me any time I go on a walk just in case something happens, which it never has, since my pepper spray ran out. Two days ago I was on a walk and someone screamed "Hey, baby!" out their window at me and my 18 month streak of not getting catcalled ended. When I went on a walk today I turned a corner onto a busy road where I normally walk only one block and then turn onto a quiet neighborhood street. I was catcalled four fucking times within one block. In one fucking block of walking. I must have woken up on the wrong side of the bed or something, because I started sobbing. I was so tempted to just sit down in the middle of the sidewalk and cry my life away. I ended up just turning around and heading home, crying the whole way. Why do men have to be like that? What can we do to stop this bullshit, if anything?It literally ruined my day. What do you ladies do in reaction to this sort of behavior?                      I am 23 and left work in a shopping centre is broad daylight and this old guy came up real close behind me and next to me and was kind of pushing me into a wall, cornering me and asking weird, nonsensical questions about my work. When I stopped, he didn't notice and got ahead slightly so I sped walked away from him and he shouted after me aggressively "Aye you do that! You go and run!"I checked over my shoulder the entire walk home. My anxiety is flaring badly.This is why I get so anxious of older men and I'm not friendly with them.                                                              Hi, I’d like to tell you all about Ana Orantes. 99% of you haven’t probably heard of her, ever. But she’s one of the most iconic women in my country, for feminists and for every woman. I think it’s sad that she’s only known here, so I’m gonna tell her story for all of you to read.I live in Spain. Not so long ago, 20 or 25 years ago, abuse against women wasn’t seen as a problem. Like, it was something that didn’t happen so much. It only happened in the “worst families”. Sure, sometimes a husband hit her wife, so what? It was just a slap, she probably did something to get it, it was pretty occasional. Nobody talked about it because “it wasn’t a real problem”. Yeah, abusers were known in their towns, by their neighbors, but never make national press. Laws didn’t protect the women, because “she probably is exaggerating”.Enter Ana Orantes. In December 4th, 1997, she went to a TV Show, to talk about all the physical abuse she had suffered from her ex-husband during a 40 years marriage. She was 60 then. Her testimony was heartbreaking. Nobody could imagine something like that could happen in a “normal” family. Both of them workers, with children, a good house...For 40 years she suffered all kinds of abuse: Grabbing her by the hair and stomping her against the wall, kicks in the stomach, sitting her in a chair and hitting her with a stick until she was forced to say he was right... all of this for the slightest provocation; “the food is too cold” “the food is too hot” “you danced with your cousin”...In her own words: “It weren’t slaps, they were beatings... I couldn’t breath, I couldn’t talk, because I “didn’t know how to talk, I was illiterate, I was dumb, I was just furniture, I was worthless”... and I had to endure it, I had to endure beating after beating. I feared him. I was terrified of him. If it was 10 in the night, and he wasn’t home yet, I started trembling like a little girl, because I knew what was coming...”Due to the social conventions of those years, she didn’t report him to police during the first years. She was expected to keep going like a good wife. She couldn’t divorce either, it wasn’t legal here until 1981. Years later, she started reporting him at last. The usual answer from the police was “those are normal fights in a family”. Fifteen times she reported for abuse, fifteen times nothing was done. She finally ended filling for divorce, in various occasions during the 80’s, and ended up getting it in 1996. The sentence forced her to still live in the same house as her ex-husband, but divided. Not that it mattered, because at that point he was already living with another woman in her house, and only returned home occasionally, but there was still always fights and abuses. Until December 17th, 13 days after the TV interview, when he returned to the house for the last time. And it was to kill her. He waited for her, approached her from the back, threw a can of gasoline all over her, and set her on fire. He watched her die burning and then fled.He later turned himself to police. Was sentenced to 17 years in prison, and died 7 years later from a heart attack, still behind bars. The story shocked the whole country. It made it to national press. The laws were changed shortly after that, creating restriction orders, centers for help for the abused women, and recognizing psychological abuse as a crime.It really shames me that it took the death of a woman for us as a country to start doing something about abuse against women. But we’ve come a long way since then. Although of course there’s still much work to do. Last year, 47 woman were killed by their partners in Spain. It may seem just a few in a country of nearly 47 million people. But it’s still too much. And I’m sure they’ll be even more, if it weren’t for Ana Orantes, and her courage to speak up about the horrors she suffered. I've worked for over 45 years, always making less than my males "equals"...how is this givernment system fair to women, all of us? TLDR; female baby boomer boss bullies me into tears because of how I look/dressShe made me cry at work yesterday by shaming the way I dress in front of everyone and I just had to tell someone.I work casually at a retail business that is family owned, the boss is a alt-right Trump supporter and a huge sexist despite being a woman herself. She is incredibly against anything that is non-traditional value or modern, we still write all receipt and records by hands and business had been running like that for almost 4 decades. Among all other employees I’m the only non-blond or non-caucassian woman as well as the only one below 30. There has never been a dress code and everyone wears pretty casual clothes, but because they are of an older generations they all have sort of the same style of dressing.My boss constantly express her hatred for modern non-conservative fashion including jeans on women, sneakers...etcs. Among peers my age I’m already considered very conservatively dressed, long sleeves always, collar shirts and never outrageous color or pattern at work and no hair colour. I always iron my shirt and wear plain/polite clothes. My hair is plain black with bob cut and fringe. This still does not goes well with her. She had been constantly criticising how I dress while no customer had ever had problem with it, i.e. if I wear a shirt that is slim fit she would complain it shows too much figures (despite me being pretty thin and barely has anything to my body) and wanted me to put on blazers with pointy shoulders, or once I wore skirts past the knees she would say it is too short. However this is very double standard since the other male staff constantly wear dark jeans and sneakers and slim fit shirts without a problem, or the other ladies who wore dresses/skirt to their knees but since they are much taller than me it always seem like their skirts are longer than mine despite proportionally it is the same.I figured she just have problems against my generation but yesterday she went too far and shamed me in front of everyone else by calling me a slob, to which later everyone else had console me and said they did not think so and she was just being mean to me. I was dressed in normal black jeans, a formal white shirt with a dark brown sweater that is a little bit worn and frayed. She immediately scowled me as soon as I walked in, saying I look awful and my sweater looks horrid. I offered to take it off as I have a white shirt underneath and just walked into work as it was breezy outside. She said outloud that it might be worse even though it was clearly a long sleeve formal white shirt underneath, even asked again “Is it?” when I clarified that, then said unnecessary thing like “Do you even wear a bra underneath?” which I found very unnecessary. I have never go out without bra and have barely existent boobs since I’m pretty thin, and my shirt was buttoned up to the second last. She just assumed because of my age whatever horrid milennial fashion would apply to me as well. Not only that, she started going on about my fringe being too long, getting into my eyes and demanded “I want it short and I want it by this Saturday”. When I said I will get to it but might not be too soon since I’m busy this week (mid semester, fulltime at uni), she said “You are a student you are not busy!” and was being incredibly condecending, saying “look at eveyone they all look lovely and you look sloppy” then pointed at the 3 other ladies who all look similar to her, over-40-years-old caucassian blond wearing some kind of long dresses. I was on the verge of tears and thankfully the other employees distracted her enough to leave me alone and by then I was crying in the backroom. I’ve just been diagnosed with ADHD (mixed subtype). I also have type 2 bipolar disorder. I’m so frustrated by my husband and dad’s reactions. Neither one of them is acknowledging that I have ADHD, based on their antiquated views of what the symptoms are and due to the fact that they’ve discussed this and both agree (therefore, they must collectively be smarter than the two psychiatrists who diagnosed me). It’s so invalidating and I’m not sure how to handle it. It makes me feel like no body believes me and in my worse moments I feel like maybe the doctors are wrong.      “Brett pulled his tank top up over his head and stared at himself in the full-length mirror. He pushed down his jeans, then his boxers, and imagined the moment when Jennifer saw him nude for the first time. His feet were average-sized, and there was hair on his toes that he should probably take care of before tonight. He liked his legs just fine, but his thighs were wide and embarrassingly muscular. He tried standing at an angle, a twist at his waist. Some improvement. In that position, it was easier to see his ass and notice that it was not as pert as it had been at 22. He clenched both cheeks, hoping that tightened its look. He sucked in his tummy and pulled his pecs up high, trying to present them like pastries in a bakery window. Would she like him? Were the goods good enough? He pouted his lips and ran his hands over his thighs, masking their expanse. Maybe.”“There is a particular look about a teenage boy that lets you know what kind of man he’ll be. A certain fullness of lips, a frank sensuality in his gaze. We all know what the word for that is, but it’s not polite to use it until he’s proven he’s that kind of boy.”“But I don’t get it!” Shea was panting, trying to catch up to Michael as he fled. “The monster ate everyone else. How did you escape?”Michael reached the boat first, flinging himself in. He waited for Shea to follow him and take the oars, guiding them smoothly away from the shore.“It’s because I was different from the other boys,” he said, pushing his hair behind his ear and looking away.“What do you mean, different?” Shea’s muscles rippled and flexed as she rowed them to safety, and Michael could not tear his eyes away.“Different. Pure, the monster said. Because I’m… I’ve never…” He looked away again, and the moonlight caught on his throat, outlined his clavicle.“You’re a virgin,” Shea said, realization dawning. “What a waste.”Michael blushed.“If we get out of this alive,“ she said. “I’m going to fix that.”          ____by Meg Elison [via](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/if-women-wrote-men-the-way-men-write-women)         I just returned from the inspiring Women in the World Summit in New York City, hosted by Tina Brown of Newsweek and The Daily Beast.Some of the most dynamic global advocates for women spoke – from Hillary Clinton and Oprah to Angelina Jolie and Dr. Mamphela Ramphele, who may soon campaign to become the president of South Africa.I was very honored to represent Women on Fire as one of the 2,500 attendees from around the globe.During the two days, there was so much presented to digest about the condition of women -- our rights, our health, our education and our future.So, my personal goal was to return from the conference with at least one concrete step or strategy that could improve your life, mine and other women’s as well.Thanks to hearing so many courageous women tell their stories at the Summit, I found what we must do -- or rather, what we must not do.What these women who survived being raped, beaten, starved, kidnapped, abused, marginalized, shot at, married off at age 11, sent to orphanages, denied education and more had in common was this:They did not view themselves as victims. Ever.They found a thread of hope and clung to it.They turned their pain into advocacy.They transformed their seemingly impossible dreams into reality.And in doing so, they are alive and well and telling their stories and advocating for women who are still under the most adverse and sub-human conditions.It is disheartening in this 21st century that so many women and girls continue to be owned and traded like cattle, defiled, denied education and physically and emotionally abused – and worse, if that’s even possible to imagine.I hope you have a chance to watch Michaela’s, Malala’s and Tererai’s video stories and be inspired by how they transformed their extreme adversities into an ocean of hope for all of us.To wild applause, Hillary Clinton reinforced what nearly all speakers said:“Women are not victims. We are agents of change and drivers of progress.”My beloved Women On Fire, we must band together and create the changes so necessary for the world.(And, thank you to so many of you reading this who are working so hard to help women move forward.)“A thousand spider webs can tie up the fiercest lion” has always been one of my favorite African proverbs.We must make sure we are not holding ourselves back from sharing our gifts with the world because we feel or act as though we are victims -- on any front.When I became a coach nearly two decades ago, a therapist friend of mine shared with me the five behaviors that characterize people acting as victims:They blame.They avoid.They whine.They label negatively others or the situation.They are sarcastic.I shudder to think of the times I play a victim.  I really prefer to think I don’t, but that would not be true.I blame when things don’t go my way; I whine when I think I’ve been treated unfairly; I label negatively and plot revenge (even though I don’t act on it) when I think someone has mistreated someone I love or care about.What became so clear last week is that none of my being a victim will ever change anything for the better.What I must do is re-dedicate my energy to stand tall and brave, alongside my fierce sisters in this country and around the world, who courageously stand up to outdated traditions that limit women, who are peacemakers in face of violence, and who rise above deplorable conditions to achieve better lives for themselves and others.The least I can do is to not play a victim in my own daily, privileged life.                               I really wish there was a Reddit for grown women who grew up without a mother, or for those that grew up with psychologically damaging ones. You have no idea how much I wish someone would have taught me how to buy eyeliner or how to know that random stuff with my female body was okay. Having this resource would prevent so much embarrassment for kids today. I had enough of make-up the cost and damage it has done to my pores in my skin. So just stopped wearing it all together. I noticed in just 4 weeks the dramatic change was noticeable to me and people were commenting on how young I was looking. I didn't have any issues at work due to the decision to stop wearing it. It has become such a huge part of our lives. To the point girls at school use it daily when they do not need it. Self love of the way I look has improved.I still use moisture daily and night cream every 2 weeks to keep you skin hydrated. Much happier and richer (cost wise and emotionally)                         A little context, I’m in NC for a couple months while I sort some visa stuff out. My dad’s having me do maintece at some properties he owns so I can earn a little money while I’m here. This mostly means replacing fascia boards, pressure washing, bleaching out storage units, etc. One of the properties is an empty house that’s being prepared to rent. I’m sanding and painting doors, pressure washing the patios, and cleaning the inside of the house as best I can. My dad’s co-manager remarked today, “this place looks like a bunch of guys cleaned it. It’s a good thing you’re here; it could really use a woman’s touch.”This remark annoyed me because it’s such an outdated gender stereotype, that women are clean and men are messy. Half of me didn’t want to come off like the #triggered chick, and the other half was like “....dude. Really?” I ended up not saying anything to him because I felt like on the spectrum of sexist remarks, this was fairly harmless. Anyway, I just wanted to get feedback from other women because I know we deal with remarks like these more often than we should, and I’m curious what stuff you speak up about, and what you choose to ignore.                      This website has allowed a lot of "normal" women to feel confident that their beasts are beautiful, counter to the direction that all women should be plastic and have the "perfect" breasts. I'm considering volunteering a photo for this website. This is a positive movement and I feel that more women, and men, should be encouraged to embrace their natural selves. (Trying this again ^_^ Sorry about the non-link post earlier) [Picture gallery](http://www.007b.com/breast_gallery_1.php)  I’m intelligent, educated and have dealt with Trauma, addiction and depression my whole life. To me, it’s something that everyone can understand and deal with given strength and hope. However, I have reached a place I can’t recover from. I’m medicated in the right way, I have tools to deal with depression, anxiety and addiction, but when I start to feel a little like a good person, someone from my family is right there to tell me how fragile I am or how bad I’ve been. I’m doing my best and I feel just so fucked. I know I don’t know people here. I’ve just joined and this, stupidly enough is my first post. I’m just feeling alone and maybe someone can relate and we can help each other.

Medicare for all is something virtually every other developed nation has and has better outcomes than the U.S..Furthermore, tax loopholes exploited by the wealthy with teams of lawyers result in the loss of around [$70 Billion per year](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/10/opinion/gabriel-zucman-paradise-papers-tax-evasion.html). Of course there will always be loopholes and even the most comprehensive legislation couldn't solve all of tax avoidance. So let's call it $50 Billion.The final part of this trifecta is the fact the U.S. spends more on it's defense budget ($610 Billion) than the next 7 largest militaries in the world [combined](https://www.defensenews.com/industry/2018/05/02/us-remains-top-military-spender-sipri-reports/). If you were to cut our defense spending in half, that would free up over $300 Billion AND we'd still be spending $77 Billion more than the second largest military budget, that being China's. Also it's important to note that most of the worlds largest militaries are our allies so that's an even further incentive to reallocate our tax dollars to something other than the military.Add up all those saving and you wind up with a cool $555 Billion, PER YEAR.That amount of money is enough to fund a Trillion dollar infrastructure bill to rebuild America over 10 years, which also includes a comprehensive 5G network all over the states ($100 Billion). That's enough to create tuition free college in the U.S. ([$75 Billion](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/07/28/487794394/hillary-s-free-tuition-promise-what-would-it-cost-how-would-it-work)), something else the rest of the developed world has. That's enough to fully restore NASA's budget to 1% of the federal budget (an additional [$30 Billion](https://www.thebalance.com/nasa-budget-current-funding-and-history-3306321)). That's enough to dive head first into complying with the Paris Climate Agreement and to combat climate change ([$150 Billion](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/06/02/fact-checking-trump-speech-paris-climate-agreement/102399674/) at the very high end even according to Trump...).You add up all those "pie in the sky", "ultra radical" amounts and you still wind up with $200 Billion PER YEAR left over to spend. That could go very nicely into a tax cut to the middle and poor class, or fixing the Flint Michigan water crisis. Just for example.Go vote this Tuesday everybody.                                        The car in front of me had a bumper sticker on it. It read “Pray for Trump Psalm 109:8.” When I got home I opened my bible to the scripture and read it and started laughing. Psalm 109:8 —“Let his days be few and brief; And let others step forward to replace him.” At last — I can voice a Biblical prayer for our president!😇                            “You’re saying he’s pro-choice AND pro-gun control? Cool!”        Ditch Mitch fact of the day                                            It's commonly known by those who are familiar with the prison system that people who have committed sex crimes against children are the inmates who have the most difficult time. Ostracized, often faced with physical abuse from inmates who view their actions as heinous and detestable, many eventually commit suicide in prison. [(source)](http://abcnews.go.com/US/prison-living-hell-pedophiles/story?id=90004)Cue Roy Moore. Not only have many 'Alabamians' doubled-down on Moore over a Democratic candidate, but the RNC has actually reversed their initial rejection of the accused candidate, and continue to fund his campaign. While I support due process in a court of law, enough substantial evidence has been provided to reasonably question Moore's fitness for public office. If I were a Republican official (especially in the current climate of sexual harassment of the past couple months), I'd want to distance my party as far as possible from the highly plausible accusations against Moore. This Faustian deal of endorsing Moore to maintain the GOP majority and pass their haphazardly constructed legislation further proves to me that even society's worst, America's criminals, will condemn a pedophile before a "scrupulous" Republican if votes are at stake. Sexual behavior with an adolescent or younger is predatory, wrong, and illegal, whether your name is Milo Yiannopoulos, Kevin Spacey, or Judge Roy Moore. If so many Republicans have the guile to say homosexuality is immoral, but won't stand against the sexual misconduct of their peers, then when will the GOP stop being identified as the party of moral, Christian, family values?**TL;DR**- Why is the GOP the party of moral fiber if even the people we've deemed as dangers to society have a harsher view on pedophilia than Republicans?

I'm legitimately baffled by some of the stuff I read today.They all seem to be waiting for the excuse to start killing people. They seem to want a civil war. They actively talk about sieges, battle tactics, and how to deal with leftists when the fighting breaks out. They detail how the southern states will drive the armies in the coastal cities towards the sea, pin them against the shore and annihilate them. One person talked about killing everyone who isn't a conservative Christian. From reading the comments it seems like a large amount of semi-normal conservatives are starting to lean into extremist views and ideologies. It's spreading.The thing that makes this all the more scary is that they legitimately think they are victims who need to defend and preserve something. They think they are warriors who will be martyred after they die "fighting for America". Their personalities are rooted in "white identity" or "Proud American" and they are ready to kill the people they perceive as threats. They think the Dems want open borders because it's a Jewish conspiracy to replace the white race and put brown people in power.This scares me. These people terrify me. There's so many of them and they all plot and plan in their corners of the internet. Many of them are armed and would probably actually kill given the excuse. We've seen the rise in white supremacist hate crimes and it doesn't seem to be getting better. These are terrorists in the making.     The FBI will do it's own investigation with a limited scope dictated by the White House (which cannot include Julie Swetnick's case).    **The Democratic Party and other interested groups need to hire a team of professional investigators and lawyers.** These people can gather all of the evidence and testimony from witnesses and involved parties. They can talk to witnesses willing to talk and get their statements.  They can include This any information and testimony made public from the FBI's investigation.   **An experienced team can organize all of this evidence in one document that can be presented to the public.** It should be published online in PDF format so that anyone can read this report.  Please tell me this is happening. I hope there people with vision and leadership within the Party or other organizations that are making this happen.  We need to have the evidence in one place, compiled and organized, and available to the public.    This Report, along with the FBI's results of their investigation, is needed so that anyone can read the witness statements and see the evidence of past actions by Kavanaugh.     My questions:   - Who is doing this?  - Pelosi, will your office offer this to the public?   - Can we identify who is doing this or determine that no one is doing this? - What is needed to make this happen?   Let's do this right. You know there is enough money and support to make this happen.   **If the public has easy access to an organized report with all of the evidence, it will be much harder for anyone to deny that this evidence exists.**          "I don't like to talk about politics on Facebook-- political history is my job, after all, and you are my friends-- but there is an important non-partisan point to make today. What Bannon is doing, most dramatically with last night's ban on immigration from seven predomitly Muslim countries-- is creating what is known as a "shock event." Such an event is unexpected and confusing and throws a society into chaos. People scramble to react to the event, usually along some fault line that those responsible for the event can widen by claiming that they alone know how to restore order. When opponents speak out, the authors of the shock event call them enemies. As society reels and tempers run high, those responsible for the shock event perform a sleight of hand to achieve their real goal, a goal they know to be hugely unpopular, but from which everyone has been distracted as they fight over the initial event. There is no longer concerted opposition to the real goal; opposition divides along the partisan lines established by the shock event.Last night's Executive Order has all the hallmarks of a shock event. It was not reviewed by any governmental agencies or lawyers before it was released, and counterterrorism experts insist they did not ask for it. People charged with enforcing it got no instructions about how to do so. Courts immediately have declared parts of it unconstitutional, but border police in some airports are refusing to stop enforcing it. Predictably, chaos has followed and tempers are hot.My point today is this: unless you are the person setting it up, it is in no one's interest to play the shock event game. It is designed explicitly to divide people who might otherwise come together so they cannot stand against something its authors think they won't like. I don't know what Bannon is up to-- although I have some guesses-- but because I know Bannon's ideas well, I am positive that there is not a single person whom I consider a friend on either side of the aisle-- and my friends range pretty widely-- who will benefit from whatever it is. If the shock event strategy works, though, many of you will blame each other, rather than Bannon, for the fallout. And the country will have been tricked into accepting their real goal. But because shock events destabilize a society, they can also be used positively. We do not have to respond along old fault lines. We could just as easily reorganize into a different pattern that threatens the people who sparked the event. A successful shock event depends on speed and chaos because it requires knee-jerk reactions so that people divide along established lines. This, for example, is how Confederate leaders railroaded the initial southern states out of the Union. If people realize they are being played, though, they can reach across old lines and reorganize to challenge the leaders who are pulling the strings. This was Lincoln's strategy when he joined together Whigs, Democrats, Free-Soilers, anti-Nebraska voters, and nativists into the new Republican Party to stand against the Slave Power. Five years before, such a coalition would have been unimaginable. Members of those groups agreed on very little other than that they wanted all Americans to have equal economic opportunity. Once they began to work together to promote a fair economic system, though, they found much common ground. They ended up rededicating the nation to a "government of the people, by the people, and for the people." Confederate leaders and Lincoln both knew about the political potential of a shock event. As we are in the midst of one, it seems worth noting that Lincoln seemed to have the better idea about how to use it."The post is not mine. It originated from a person named Heather Richardson (apparently she's on the top search result for shock event). And I would appreciate it if it were shared to other left leaning forums so we can maintain focus (I would love to, but the ten minute rule). Thanks.                          I hope this is an alright place to post something like this, but nothing is more infuriating when debating politics with someone several decades older than me (I'm 22), and they resort to the condescending response "well you're just young, when you're older and wiser, you'll become conservative". This is obviously not entirely true and just a cop out answer when I confront them with facts and polls and what-not, but it still bugs me to my core, and I can never think of anything substantial in response. What's a good thing to say to these kinds of people?           So for the last 10 minutes, during the opening of today's impeachment hearing, Doug Collins flapped his gums while he falsely claimed that Democrats are ignoring facts, while plainly ignoring all facts of the case. Now he's running his mouth about pointless procedural bullshit that is irrelevant to the matters of the hearing. This group continually just whines and cries because they cannot stand the fact that they hitched their cart to a poisoned and toxic horse. Now the joke of a human Matt Gaetz begins shouting like the pathetic frat boy loudmouth he is. The whole strategy at this point, for republicans, is to disrupt, delay, interrupt, obfuscate, bloviate etc.They ignore facts while saying Democrats are ignoring facts  They make the whole thing into a shit show while claiming Democrats are creating a shit show  They lie left and right while saying democrats are lying.  They have no integrity and only possess the capability to project.They claim the institution of congress is in great danger, while manifestly representing that very threat.  Watch today's hearings people! See what we're up against.... See who we have to get voted out of office in 2020 and watch why that is. Watch republican continue their continued attempt to weaken and destroy democracy in order to cement their own power at the expense of the freedoms and rights of the American people. I asked this question a few hours ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8w0op6/why_do_you_think_there_is_a_sudden_rise_in_strong/) where you can read some of the answers. What do you guys think of this sudden uptake on what I call "Liberal-Hate"?                        There are 20 Dems running in the primary. That means 19 *will* lose. Some early, some late; some will put up a good fight, others not so much. Sure, one may be chosen as VP candidate, but understand, chances are that your first choice guy/gal in the race will likely lose.Pragmatism is the name of the game when it comes to the GE; not nit-picky purity tests. Otherwise, staying home, or write ins, or other forms of protesting the winner of the Dem primary because he/she was not your first choice just ensures another 4 years of Trump. While I have my favorites in the primary, there are 20 people running who I'd personally like to see occupy the the WH over its current inhabitant. We can't win the race when we're so set on fighting amongst ourselves        It's fucking madness that this is tolerated.           Trump speaking to a crowd in Nevada about being proud of gutting the ACA, and they cheered when he said it’s the Democrats fault. STUPIDITY LIVES EVERYWHERE.                     Yes, by firing of Preet Bharara Trump has shown that he doesn't want to clean the swamp in Washington or elsewhere in the country, especially in New York where Trump grew up and where most of Trump's shady businesses are located.Otherwise why Trump would kick out a very respected and well known U.S. Attorney like Mr. Bharara whom he promised to keep once he took total control of this country.The question that comes to everybody's mind is maybe Mr. Bharara was too close to finding some shady deals that Trump was engaged in.Maybe all of Trump's ruse that he was against Wall Street was nothing but to distract all of his followers from the fact that he himself had made heavy involvements with the sharks of Wall Street.And given his very close relationship with the winners of Wall Street like Mr. Carl Icahn and Mr. Barack, Trump might've used a very significant amount of his own money through a very heavy investments in the range of billions of dollars in the stock market. Probably most of the venture capitalists whom Mr. Bharara was trying to put behind bars are frequent visitors to the Trump Tower exchanging pleasantries as well as sheer cash.So it might've become quite obvious to Mr. Trump that this man Mr. Preet Bharara whom he promised to keep in his position as a Wall Street enforcer, is now becoming a pain in Trump's butt.By going after the same people in the Wall Street, Mr. Bharara very inadvertently might've come across some big names in the hedge fund industry who were using insider trading as a way to make billions of dollars for billionaires like Trump and his partners in crime.                            > Nothing is more important to the Register and its polling partners than the integrity of the Iowa Poll.

Yes, though it would probably be really hard for Biden to make the choice. There's a lot of equally talented and amazing options to pick from. If Pete won, he'd have the same issue.

However, one could also argue that there are other strategic picks.

Keisha Lance Bottoms is the mayor of Atlanta, and she could put Georgia in play (16 electoral votes); Trump won the state by 5 points in 2016.

Everyone has their own personal fave for who they'd like to see be added as a veep option.  There are some pros and cons with adding Buttigieg to a ticket. A veep option should fortify any of Biden's perceived weaknesses. For example, Buttigieg is a young vet that could bring in new energy and carry the torch after Biden. Strategically, would Pete be strong enough to deliver Indiana for the Democrats? Trump won Indiana by 19 points in 2016 but he has +3 approval rating now according to Morning Consult so Buttigieg may very well help put the state in play.  A con would be that Biden would be in a difficult position to choose who to run with because there are other equally and amazing talented options to pick. Biden could decide to have a female running mate on the ticket. >Americans who have been wondering why President Trump has taken the extraordinary step of trying to block every document from being released to Congress in his impeachment need wonder no longer. The new documents released Tuesday evening by the House Intelligence Committee were devastating to Trump’s continuing — if shifting — defense of his Ukraine extortion scandal, just days before his impeachment trial is likely to begin in the Senate. >These new documents demolish at least three key defenses to which Trump and his allies have been clinging: that he was really fighting corruption when he pressured Ukraine on matters related to the Biden family; that Hunter Biden should be called as a witness at the Senate impeachment trial; and that there’s no need for a real, honest-to-goodness trial in the Senate.>...>The documents released Tuesday now show what Trump has been so afraid of. *For starters, they prove that Trump’s already-eyebrow-raising claim to have been fighting corruption in Ukraine was bogus.* Notes taken by Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas — now facing federal criminal charges — show what his and Giuliani’s mission was when they got in touch with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky: “get Zalensky [sic] to Announce that the Biden case will Be Investigated.” Look hard at the real goal here: not to prompt an investigation of Hunter Biden, but to score an announcement of a Biden investigation. >Pursuing an announcement, rather than an actual investigation, makes sense only if Trump’s objective was to dirty the reputation of his leading political rival, Joe Biden. Both of us served in high-ranking Justice Department positions; we’ve never heard of an investigation that is kept from the Justice Department, given to a private attorney and then publicly announced — investigations work best when done in secret. If Trump, as he has long claimed, was truly interested in pursuing anticorruption in the bizarrely specific form of a single investigation of a single American citizen, then he would’ve wanted an actual investigation. Instead, Trump was fixated on the public announcement of one — which, if anything, would have harmed the investigation by tipping off its subject. *The public announcement would’ve helped only one thing: Trump’s personal political prospects.* > [Julian Zelizer:](https://twitter.com/julianzelizer/status/1217289357746475008)‏>@JoeBiden's answer about not holding a grudge are very good.

Delegate-wise, Klobuchar would net an average of 1 pledged delegate out of 41 in 80% of the simulations. Yang and Booker would receive 0. *Just because a candidate does poorly in Iowa doesn't necessarily mean that they'll drop out by then.* They could continue onwards towards New Hampshire. It is likely that some of the other candidates that are not polling so well will drop out by or before then. In New Hampshire, [based on today's info](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primary-forecast/new-hampshire/), Klobuchar would have a 2% chance at winning that primary, Yang a 0.3% chance, and Booker the same with a 0.3% chance. Again, Klobuchar would net an average of 1 pledged delegate out of 24 in 80% of the simulations. Yang and Booker would receive 0. Basically, if you were backing a candidate that is not in the top four then someone like Klobuchar would be in a better position than someone else polling at or less than she is.

That was Jimmy Carter, who did so in 1976.

The 3% and 71% marks are the lower and upper thresholds of the extent of what's statistically possible based on the info that's available today.Sanders won the New Hampshire primary with a whopping 60% of the vote. He's currently polling at 20% give or take a few percentage points. That means he's lost around 66% of his support since 2016. Sanders should be performing considerably well because New Hampshire is a state that is demographically favorable to him but he's not doing well compared to 2016.Sanders came in second place in Iowa in 2016 with 49%. He's polling around 20% give or take a few percentage points. That means he's lost around 50% of his support since 2016.Sanders won the Vermont primary with a whopping 86% of the vote. If you use Iowa as a model on Vermont and assume he's lost 50% he would be getting 43% of the vote--so 41% seems plausible in that situation. Again, that doesn't mean he'll only get that much support--it's just what's likely. Remember, it's running with the idea that there are multiple candidates and it's not just a two-person race. The Vermont primary happens on Super Tuesday so it's likely that it'll be narrowed down to a four-person race or less by then. However, several candidates will still appear on the primary ballot.Edit:Based on the FiveThirtyEight primary model: 80% of the simulations ended up like this *as a forecasted average based on today's info.*Candidate | Avg %---|---Sanders | 41%Biden | 19%Warren | 15%Buttigieg | 12%Klobuchar | 3%Yang | 2%Everyone else: Less than 2% or [did not qualify for the primary.](https://www.sec.state.vt.us/media/915255/2020-qualified-candidates.pdf) Example: Cory Booker, Michael Bennet and John Delaney [won't be on Vermont primary ballot.](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/17/politics/vermont-primary-ballot/index.html) Each of those candidates appear as 0% on the Vermont model because none of those candidates qualified to be on the primary ballot.

Sanders did better with caucuses compared to primaries. Primaries let more people vote compared to caucuses. Even though the spread (Biden +8) from the Morning Consult poll was slightly smaller than last week, the RCP average still ticked upwards for Biden. An older CNN poll conducted Dec. 12-15 with a spread of Biden +6 fell off. The next polls to fall off will be the NBC News/WSJ poll or the Emerson poll from December. This will probably mean that Warren's numbers will continue trending downwards (13.4-14.0%) and Pete's will average around 7.2-7.5%. Sanders numbers will move down slightly once the Emerson poll falls off (it has his highest percentage at 25%). It'll probably be around 18.8-20.0%.

The poll from October only asks those being polled which of the top three candidates would they choose. I'm assuming the pollster is taking into consideration that most of the other candidates would have dropped out by the time Massachusetts had its primary on Super Tuesday.The poll from October had Warren 6 points above Biden, so this was when Warren's numbers were midway through a trend downwards before partially stabilizing.

It also makes a comparison of Biden and Sanders' numbers in February and how the primary race has been mostly stable (of course the other candidates have risen and fallen with time). The pollster also states that Biden has risen in the early states while Sanders has fallen. The poll doesn't state the individual numbers for each early state. **National poll** (looking at just Biden and Sanders)Candidate | [Feb. 11-17, 2019](https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Political-Intelligence-2.19.19.pdf) | [Dec. 23-29, 2019](https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Morning-Consult-Political-Intelligence-12.30.19.pdf) ---|---|----Biden | 30% (Spread: Biden +9)| 32% (Spread: Biden +11)Sanders | 21% | 21% I haven't seen it yet. They may have given it a clickbait title or it's within one of their YouTube vids. The clickbait title format is usually: Sanders, Warren, or Buttigieg [falls, rises, nosedives, slips] in new national poll.Example: [Buttigieg slips in new national poll](https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/475138-buttigieg-slips-in-new-national-poll)That example poll was posted on Dec. 18, 2019.Edit:I just checked their videos and nothing *new* has been posted. A new vid has been posted today *but* it shows [an old poll](https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/476270-what-americas-thinking-december-30-2019) that was conducted Dec. 13-14, 2019--it's the same one with the clickbait title mentioned in the above example ([YouTube vid link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0eI_jjfbEU)). That old poll has been on RCP for a while now.Edit 2:The next The Hill/HarrisX poll will probably be posted after the 2nd. Reasoning: They usually poll during the middle of the month or towards the end of the month (Friday-Saturday, or Saturday-Sunday). The last four polls were conducted on Dec. 13-14, Nov. 30-Dec. 1, Nov. 16-17, and Nov. 1-2. So it's likely that the next poll will be released after Jan. 2nd meaning they already polled sometime during the 27th through the 29th or they haven't started yet so it'll be conducted sometime during 3rd through the 5th. A Monmouth poll or a Harvard/Harris poll *might* be released around that same period as well.

The current RCP national average spread is: Biden +9.4. The surname Buttigieg is of Maltese origin. There's *nothing* dodgy about it.>[Pete] is the son of Maltese immigrant Prof. Joseph A. Buttigieg, who lectures at the University of Notre Dame. --[Malta Today](https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/92511/how_do_you_pronounce_buttigieg_is_a_question_more_americans_are_asking_today) newspaperYou can also browse [Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg#cite_note-Trebay-180618-16)>His father, who was from Hamrun, Malta, had studied to be a Jesuit priest before emigrating to the United States and embarking on a secular career as a professor of literature at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend.* [Beck Interviews Buttigieg About His Faith and Catholic Roots](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/deaconsbench/2019/04/beck-interviews-buttigieg-about-his-faith-and-catholic-roots/)The surname itself is roughly translated as ["chicken owner" or "poulterer."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttigieg)You can use this site to browse common surnames:* https://www.houseofnames.com This is false and misleading at best.>But in that Morning Consult poll...:>...Yang earned 6 percent support from independents, compared with 3 percent among Democrats. >...>In last week’s poll from The Economist/YouGov, for instance, 25 percent of Trump voters who said they plan to vote in the 2020 Democratic primary said they intended to support Gabbard, *versus just 2 percent who said they would support Yang.*That 2 percent figure includes *all* ages.* https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-about-andrew-yangs-base/ That's a hypothetical that's *extremely unlikely and not going to happen.* You're asking people to engage in a debate where a candidate has less than a 2% chance of winning the nomination. If you read the article linked within the comment, it said:>only one candidate in the modern primary era has come back from averaging less than 5 percent in national polls *in the second half of the year before the primary* to win the nomination. There's only a few days left in this year and the candidate has not received more than 5% in the national polls as an average.That's the major reason pollsters don't field a question like that and why such unlikely head-to-head matchups don't appear on RCP. Basically, *pollsters* are not going to waste their time *or those being polled* on such a hypothetical.* https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/general_election/Again, see rule 10.https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeBiden/about/rules/ Currently, he has a 2% chance or less of winning the nomination so it's extremely unlikely he'd ever take on Trump to begin with. Three months ago, Yang was at 3.2% in the RCP average. Right now, he's at 3.5%.[Nate Silver tweeted this a several months ago:](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1166128339414913024)>...Candidates leading in the polls at this point in the race win their nominations around half the time, or a bit more. *Candidates polling at <5% win only ~2 percent of the time or so.*And if you look at an [article that he wrote in September:](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/if-youre-polling-in-the-low-single-digits-youre-probably-toast/)>As my colleague Geoffrey Skelley discovered in his [series on the predictive accuracy of early primary polls,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-more-than-40-years-of-early-primary-polls-tell-us-about-2020-part-1/) only one candidate in the modern primary era has come back from averaging less than 5 percent in national polls *in the second half of the year before the primary* to win the nomination. That was Jimmy Carter, who did so in 1976. Given the number of candidates who failed to make it, that would make their chances of winning the nomination very low — *somewhere on the order of 1 or 2 percent.* Read rule 10.https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeBiden/about/rules/ The votes will eventually consolidate.Basically, it works like this. You have to receive 15% of the caucus or primary vote to get any delegates. That means if you are a *lower-tiered* candidate receiving less than 15% in Iowa or New Hampshire--then your campaign is likely and unfortunately reached its end ***unless*** you know you can do better down the line in another state like Nevada or South Carolina (or going onwards through Super Tuesday). So candidates like Williamson are more than likely not going forward after either caucus night in Iowa or primary night in New Hampshire. Candidates like Williamson could go forward but it's extremely unlikely that a candidate like that will receive any significant amount of delegates by June. When candidates drop out, they *don't all jump towards one specific candidate.* Their supporters might favor one candidate over another that might still be in the race. Hypothetically, let's say Warren has had enough and calls it quits tomorrow morning for whatever reason. 100% of her supporters *are not* going to go over to Sanders. Let's use a recent Morning Consult poll and continue with the example of Warren hypothetically dropping out tomorrow. Current national poll (looking at the top 4 only to make it easier):Candidate | %---|---Biden | 31%Sanders | 21%Warren | 15%Buttigieg | 9%Spread: Biden +10These are Warren supporter's second choice selections:* https://i.imgur.com/FORU6tu.pngIf you look at the numbers Sanders has an 8 point lead as far as where a Warren supporter might go. Nationally, Warren is receiving 15%. We'll be generous and give Warren 15.4%--when you round this it's still 15%. Everyone else is remains at at X.0%. So Biden would remain at 31.0%, Sanders at 21.0%, and Buttigieg at 9.0%. At least 31% of that 15.4% would go to Sanders as their second choice (so 5%--rounded), Biden with 23% as their second choice (so 4%), and Buttigieg with 13% as their second choice (so 2%). With that in mind a candidate receiving less support than Buttigieg probably would not see more than a 0-1.4% increase in support.So a national Morning Consult poll *a week from now might* look like this if she were to drop out tomorrow morning for whatever reason (Morning Consult polls show little variation from week-to-week unless something major happens):Candidate | %---|---Biden | 35%Sanders | 26%Buttigieg | 11%Spread: Biden +9Even though Sanders has an 8 point lead as Warren supporter's second choice selection when you do the math the final spread is still almost identical. Let's apply the same thought process to a New Hampshire poll because Sanders won New Hampshire with with a whopping 60% of the vote in 2016.Recent WBUR poll (an A/B rated poll and looking at the top 4 only to make it easier):Candidate | %---|---Buttigieg | 18%Biden | 17%Sanders | 15%Warren | 12%Spread: Buttigieg +1Warren is receiving 12% in that poll. We'll be generous and give Warren 12.4%--when you round this it's still 12%. Everyone else is remains at at X.0%. At least 31% of that 12.4% would go to Sanders as their second choice (so 4%--this is 3.844% rounded), Biden with 23% as their second choice (so 3%--this is 2.852% rounded), and Buttigieg with 13% as their second choice (2%--this is 1.612% rounded).So a New Hampshire Poll *a week from now might look like this if the same people were polled*:Candidate | %---|---Biden | 20% (17.0%+2.852% = 19.852%)Buttigieg | 20% (18.0%+1.612% = 19.612%)Sanders | 19% (15.0%+3.844% = 18.844%)Spread: Biden +0.24%What does this mean? Sanders won in 2016 with 60% of the vote but now he’s *only receiving 15-20%*. Sanders has 99% name recognition in New Hampshire so he shouldn’t have to be competing in this state but the state is competitive so someone like Biden or Buttigieg could carry the state. If Biden carries Iowa it’s possible he could win New Hampshire as well. There are other scenarios that could play out. For example, Buttigieg could win Iowa, Sanders could win New Hampshire, but Biden wins Nevada on Feb. 22, 2020 and South Carolina on Feb. 29, 2020. Demographically, Sanders would be performing better in states like New Hampshire *but he’s not.* Likewise, Buttigieg is not doing well with African American votes in states like South Carolina. Buttigieg is receiving around 9-10% total support at best, and only a small amount of that are African American voters. [A Quinnipiac poll in November](https://poll.qu.edu/south-carolina/release-detail?ReleaseID=3649) showed Buttigieg received less than one percent among African American voters.*Let’s say Buttigieg drops out after South Carolina votes but Sanders stays in.* Those states combined would have more delegates than Iowa and New Hampshire combined. Super Tuesday is on March 3, 2020. Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia will be voting in their primaries. A majority of those states would favor Biden by a wide margin (Example: Tennessee and Texas). Some of those Super Tuesday states now vote in primaries and not caucuses. In 2016, Clinton did well in states that used primaries while Sanders did well in states that used caucuses. States favor primaries because more people can participate in them. Biden could very well carry the states people thought Sanders would have won.Let's ignore all the above and just look at some head-to-head national matchups listed on FiveThirtyEight. * https://i.imgur.com/bSzNB3F.pngEven if you reduce the spreads by 10 to 20% Biden is ahead. https://i.imgur.com/x7hFtFk.png https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1210685537499123712 Comment that I posted yesterday:> The RCP spread will probably trend upwards for Biden the next time RCP is updated.

That’s where they are right now. They’re being abused. They’re in concentration camps.And what we started in our administration that Trump stopped, we should be moving 60 percent of our sea power to that area of the world to let, in fact, the Chinese understand that they're not going to go any further. We are going to be there to protect other folks.Secondly, we, in fact, should make sure that we begin to rebuild our alliances, which Trump has demolished, with Japan and South Korea, Australia and all -- and Indonesia. We, in fact, need to have allies who understand that we're going to stop the Chinese from their actions.We should be going to the U.N. immediately and sought sanctions against them in the United Nations for what they did. We have to be firm. We don't have to go to war. But we have to make it clear, this is as far as you go, China.And in terms of their military build-up, it's real. But it would take them about 17 years to build up to where we are. We're not looking for a war. But we've got to make clear, we are a Pacific power and we are not going to back away.

Iowa and New Hampshire are demographically Sanders strongholds. Sanders should be doing significantly better in places like these *but he's not*. Takeaways:* Biden is beating Sanders in a state where Sanders got 49% of the caucus vote in 2016; Sanders has received less than 25% within an Iowa poll throughout this year.* There have been a lot of people on different subs that have argued in the past that Emerson is usually the pollster that has favorable results for Sanders. * Emerson results use data gathered from an online panel partially provided by Amazon MTurk* Nate Cohn's [criticism of Emerson's education weighting](https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/1135943622044635145)* G.

It is no coincidence that in the now infamous July 25th call with Zelensky, Donald Trump brings up a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor and praises him. Against all evidence, Trump claims that this former prosecutor general was “very good” and “he was shut down and that's really unfair.” But the woman known for fighting corruption, his own former Ambassador, the woman ruthlessly smeared and driven from her post, the president does nothing but disparage.

William Taylor:>During that phone call, Ambassador Sondland told me that President **Trump had told him that he wants President Zelensky to state publicly that Ukraine will investigate Burisma** and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. William Taylor:>Ambassador Sondland told Mr. Yermak that the security assistance money would not come until President Zelensky committed to pursue the Burisma investigation. William Taylor:>I wrote and transmitted such a cable on August 29, describing the "folly" I saw in withholding military aid to Ukraine at a time when hostilities were still active in the east and when Russia was watching closely to gauge the level of American support for the Ukrainian government. I told the Secretary that I could not and would not defend such a policy. William Taylor:>He also told me during this call that the "President doesn't want to provide any assistance at all."

William Taylor:>On June 27, Ambassador Sondland told me during a phone conversation that **President Zelensky needed to make clear to President Trump that he, President Zelensky, was not standing in the way of "investigations."** William Taylor:>...it became clear to me by August that the channels had diverged in their objectives....>In late June, one [of] the goals of **both channels was to facilitate a visit by President Zelenskyy to the White House for a meeting with President Trump**, which President Trump had promised in his congratulatory letter of May 29. The Ukrainians were clearly eager for the meeting to happen. William Taylor:>At the same time, however, there was an irregular, informal channel of U.S. policy-making with respect to Ukraine, one which included then-Special Envoy Kurt Volker, Ambassador Sondland, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, and as I subsequently learned, Mr. Giuliani. William Taylor:>There appeared to be two channels of U.S. policy-making and implementation, one regular and *one highly irregular.* William Taylor:>**I worried about what I had heard concerning the role of Rudolph Giuliani, who had made several high-profile statements about Ukraine and U.S. policy toward the country.** So during my meeting with Secretary Pompeo on May 28, I made clear to him and the others present that if U.S. policy toward Ukraine changed, he would not want me posted there and I could not stay. He assured me that the policy of strong support for Ukraine would continue and that he would support me in defending that policy. George Kent:>The chief agitators on the Ukrainian side of this effort were some of those same corrupt former prosecutors I had encountered, particularly Victor Shokin and Yuriy Lutsenko. **They were now peddling false information in order to exact revenge against those who had exposed their misconduct, including U.S. diplomats, Ukrainian anti-corruption officials, and reform-minded civil society groups in Ukraine.** George Kent: >In mid-August, it became clear to me that Giuliani’s efforts to gin up politically motivated investigations were now infecting U.S. engagement with Ukraine, leveraging President Zelensky’s desire for a White House meeting.

RCP removes (unhighlights) polls after a certain amount of time has gone by or replaces polls when a new poll from the same pollster comes out.The most recent removal was the CNN poll (10/17-10/20) that had Biden at +15. The Quinnipiac poll was conducted 10/17-10/21. It's also likely that the Emerson poll (10/18-10/21) with Biden at +2 will end up dropping off at some point thereafter as well. Emerson releases their polls on a monthly basis so their next poll release should be sometime later towards the end of this month. The Politico/Morning Consult poll (10/21-10/27) will be replaced either on Monday night or Tuesday morning because Morning Consult usually releases their weekly poll Monday evening. Similarly, a YouGov poll conducted 10/20-10/22 was replaced by the recent one that was conducted 10/27-10/29. Assuming no new polls come out on Sunday morning and if the Quinnipiac poll gets removed before Monday the RCP averages will look something like this for the top 5:Biden | Warren | Sanders | Buttigieg | Harris | Spread---|---|----|----|----|----28.6 | 19.1 | 17.3 | 6.6 | 4.6 | **Biden +9.5** Beto sent out this broadcast earlier:https://www.pscp.tv/w/1nAKEZMBnbyGL > Washington (CNN) Tim Morrison, the top White House official on President Donald Trump's National Security Council for Europe, will be leaving his job soon, according to a source familiar with decision.

Kai Kahele, a Democrat, has raised $345,616 from Hawaii donors in his bid to unseat Gabbard. That’s more than Gabbard’s presidential campaign has raised from donors in the Aloha State — $221,501 — over the same time period through September. >...>Hawaii is one of the few states that allows candidates to run for president and Congress at the same time. But *Gabbard isn’t even attempting to raise money for her House bid, taking in no cash for her congressional campaign from July through September.* Kahele, on the other hand, has brought in nearly $500,000 and is sitting on more than $370,000 cash on hand. He has raised most of his money, 74 percent, from individual donors giving more than $200.>One of Kahele’s main criticisms of Gabbard is that she has been too focused on running for president to represent her district. He noted last week that Gabbard missed a vote to condemn President Donald Trump’s decision to abandon Kurdish forces in northern Syria. Gabbard has missed more than half of the House votes from July through September, and 83 percent of votes in October, according to GovTrack.us. Her low attendance rate is similar to many other presidential candidates. Mirror: https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/101919> This week, the people of Baltimore, the Congress and the United States lost a voice of unsurpassed moral clarity and truth: our beloved Chairman Elijah E. Cummings.> > In the House, Elijah was our North Star. He was a leader of towering character and integrity, who pushed the Congress and country always to rise to a higher purpose, reminding us why we are here. As he said whenever he saw that we were not living up to our Founders’ vision for America and meeting the needs of our children for the future: “We are better than this.”> > Elijah’s story was the story of the United States: A son of sharecroppers who became Baptist preachers, he dedicated his life to advancing justice, liberty, fairness and human dignity. He believed in the promise of America because he had lived it. As chair of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, he used his gavel to restore integrity, accountability and honesty to Washington so that government would be a force for good for working people, ensuring that all could experience the American Dream as he did.> > Firm in his principles, Elijah was also a peacemaker and a bridge-builder: passionate about what he believed in, dispassionate in his judgments about how to proceed. His clarion voice would cut through conflict, calming the waters and reaching out across the aisle, no matter how rough and tumble the debate.> > He was a generous leader. He always shared credit and took the time to mentor younger members, both on his committee and throughout our caucus. This year, during the first weeks of the new Congress, when members were being added to his highly coveted committee, he said to me, “Send me as many freshmen as you can.” He wanted to help them succeed — and he wanted to learn from them, too.> > He was a fighter for U.S. families in many respects, including lowering health-care costs. That was why members decided on the day of his passing to name our prescription drug price legislation H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act. He was always touched by the stories he heard in his community about the toll that high health-care costs took on families’ economic security and well-being. He also saw this challenge through the prism of his own personal health challenges. Elijah recognized that he had a responsibility to make a difference for others. He understood that to whom much is given, much is expected.> > We all saw the great pride he took in representing the Baltimore area. He was truly of Baltimore. As a senior member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, he was always fighting for his district and the state of Maryland, and was a powerful voice for building the infrastructure of the United States to create good-paying jobs. As a member of the U.S. Naval Academy Board of Visitors, he took great pride in Maryland’s role in our national security.> > Elijah knew that life was fleeting and precious; it was imperative for him to make the most of his time on Earth. Earlier this year, he proclaimed, “When we’re dancing with the angels the question will be asked: In 2019, what did we do to make sure we kept our democracy intact?”> > Elijah’s leadership truly strengthened America, and his life and legacy will continue to inspire us all to go forth in a way that is worthy of the oath of office that we take to the Constitution, worthy of the vision of our Founders and worthy of the aspirations of our children. For, as he often said, “Children are the living messengers we send to the future we will never see.”> > In Congress, we will miss his wisdom, his warm friendship and his great humanity. In Baltimore, we will miss our champion. May it be a comfort to his wife Maya, his three children and his entire family that so many mourn their loss and are praying for them at this sad time.> > God truly blessed the United States with the life and leadership of Elijah Cummings.

The oligarch mentioned in the article is Dmitry Firtash.[In 2018, Firtash was called a "direct agent of the Kremlin" by a *Republican senator.*](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senator-oligarch-linked-kremlin-earned-millions-while-fighting-extradition-u-n1013661)> Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., wrote in an April 2018 letter obtained by NBC News that Dmytro Firtash had served as a "direct agent of the Kremlin" and was using the money earned from ongoing "corruption" to delay his extradition to Chicago, where he has been under federal indictment since 2014.> > "This corruption undermines Ukrainian reform efforts that the United States strongly supports," Wicker wrote to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. He asked Sessions about the status of Firtash's extradition case.> > The contents of Wicker's letter, which was obtained by NBC News after Freedom of Information Act litigation with the Justice Department, have not previously been reported.>...>Federal prosecutors said in a 2017 filing that Firtash and his co-defendant in the alleged scheme, Andras Knopp, "have been identified by United States law enforcement as two upper-echelon associates of Russian organized crime.">Wicker's letter alleges that prior to 2014, Firtash acted as a "direct agent of the Kremlin" during a separate scheme to skim money from natural gas transfers between Russia's Gazprom and Ukraine.This is from 2014: >[Putin's allies channelled billions to Ukraine oligarch](https://www.reuters.com/article/russia-capitalism-gas-special-report-pix/special-report-putins-allies-channelled-billions-to-ukraine-oligarch-idUSL3N0TF4QD20141126)> In Russia, powerful friends helped him make a fortune. In the United States, officials want him extradited and put behind bars. In Austria, where he is currently free on bail of $155 million, authorities have yet to decide what to do with him.> > He is Dmitry Firtash, a former fireman and soldier. In little more than a decade, the Ukrainian went from obscurity to wealth and renown, largely by buying gas from Russia and selling it in his home country. His success was built on remarkable sweetheart deals brokered by associates of Russian leader Vladimir Putin, at immense cost to Russian taxpayers, a Reuters investigation shows.>...>Over the same time period, other documents show, bankers close to Putin granted Firtash credit lines of up to $11 billion. That credit helped Firtash, who backed pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovich’s successful 2010 bid to become Ukraine’s president, to buy a domit position in the country’s chemical and fertiliser industry and expand his influence.>...>“Firtash has always been an intermediary,” said Viktor Chumak, chairman of the anti-corruption committee in the previous Ukrainian parliament. “He is a political person representing Russia’s interests in Ukraine.” >“Matt Gaetz emerges from closed-door interview with Fiona Hill saying he was kicked out by House Democrats [because] **he’s not a member of the three committees conducting the interview,”** Raju reported just before 11 a.m. Monday morning. “He said he consulted with the House parliamentarian, who ruled that he could not be there.” >The federal indictment of South Florida businessmen Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas — associates of Rudy Giuliani who have emerged as key figures in the House impeachment inquiry into President Trump — contained a mystery as to the source of Russian money prosecutors said was used for political donations tied to a fledgling, and ultimately unsuccessful, marijuana business.>...> The federal indictment indicates that Parnas, Fruman, Correia, Kukushkin and the Russian businessman met in Nevada — where marijuana had been legalized for recreational use in 2017 — in early September 2018 to discuss the marijuana business. They formalized the plan soon after, with the Russian businessman sending the first of two $500,000 wire transfers to Fruman on Sept. 18, 2018.> > Two months later, in November, Fruman donated $10,000 to Nevada’s-then attorney general, Republican Adam Laxalt who was running for governor, and the same amount to the 2018 Republican nominee for state attorney general, Wesley Duncan, according to state campaign fice records. Duncan lost the election to Democrat Aaron Ford.>...>Subsequent filings in the case revealed that the money at issue in Kukushkin’s lawsuit appears to have come from Andrey Muraviev, a Russian businessman who was the only other investor listed in the California venture. Lawyers representing the owners of Medithrive declined to comment and a call to the management of the dispensary wasn’t returned. The Russia-based Muraviev (whose last name is sometimes spelled Muravyov) runs a Moscow-based investment fund called Parus Capital Limited and has served as an executive for several Russian companies.>Muraviev invested in the California marijuana venture through a company called Palmway Holdings Limited, which appears to be the same British Virgin Islands entity through which he invested in Qiwi, a Russian online payment platform that has been called the Russian PayPal. Muraviev was one of Qiwi’s biggest investors and served on its board for several years. When the company first went public, Muraviev reportedly sold more than 2 million shares for $37 million.Also:>In the spring of 2018, (Fruman and Parnas) lobbied at least one member of Congress, Carlos Curbelo, now a former Republican from Florida, on marijuana issues.>“They stood out a little bit. They had an air of flamboyance to them,” Curbelo said Thursday on MSNBC, adding that they boasted of White House ties and being “frequent guests at Mar-a-Lago.” Though President Trump said Thursday he did not know them, photos have circulated widely showing the men with Trump and Giuliani.Here's the vid for former Rep.

Specifically, the subpoena requires the production of documents related to March 21, 2019, and April 5, 2019 meetings between the President and DHS Officials where pardons were reportedly discussed. The subpoena also requires documents and communications referring to presidential pardons for potential violations of federal law relating to the enforcement of U.S. immigration laws or the construction of a barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border.  This subpoena also represents another step in the Committee’s investigation into obstruction of justice and abuses of power by the President as it looks to determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment.     >Chairman Nadler released the following statement:>> “The dangling of pardons by the President to encourage government officials to violate federal law would constitute another reported example of the President’s disregard for the rule of law. Such a troubling pattern of obstruction of justice would represent a continuation of the misconduct identified in the Mueller Report. The Framers did not envision the use of the presidential pardon power to encourage criminal acts at the President’s direction. As the Committee continues its investigation into whether to recommend articles of impeachment, it is imperative that we are able to obtain information about ongoing presidential misconduct and abuses of power. >> “In the coming months the Committee intends to hold hearings and conduct additional oversight related to the issue of pardons as we move forward with our investigation into obstruction of justice, public corruption, and abuses of power by the President. This information sought today and the hearings that follow will help the Committee determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment or other Article 1 remedies against the President.”TL;DR: The House Judiciary Committee has served a subpoena on the DHS for documents relating to the President’s multiple alleged attempts to offer pardons to officials for carrying out his fast-tracked policies even if it meant breaking the law.The Washington Post reported last week that [Trump told his aides not to worry about breaking any laws and that he would pardon them.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/take-the-land-president-trump-wants-a-border-wall-he-wants-it-black-and-he-wants-it-by-election-day/2019/08/27/37b80018-c821-11e9-a4f3-c081a126de70_story.html)>Trump...has directed aides to fast-track billions of dollars’ worth of construction contracts, aggressively seize private land and disregard environmental rules, according to current and former officials involved with the project.>He also has told worried subordinates that he will pardon them of any potential wrongdoing should they have to break laws to get the barriers built quickly, those officials said.>...>When aides have suggested that some orders are illegal or unworkable, Trump has suggested he would pardon the officials if they would just go ahead, aides said.

Officials maintain that the tariffs, which are taxes on imports, will help the administration gain more favorable terms of trade. But U.S. trading partners have simply retaliated with tariffs of their own. Dayton was the site of a mass shooting and Trump got into an online fight with mayor Nan Whaley after visiting the city. Trump attacked Dayton's mayor and [lied in his tweets](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/aug/09/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-democrats-distorted-his-visit-da/). Trump's rhetoric is causing people to send vitriolic messages and threats to Dayton's mayor to the point where the mayor has to get assigned a security detail. >The Trump administration announced Monday that it is rewriting how the federal government will enforce one of the country’s landmark conservation laws, the Endangered Species Act, raising fears throughout the environmentalist community...>Chief among environmentalists’ worries is that the federal government will begin conducting economic analysis as it determines whether to designate species as threatened or endangered. *The Environmental Defense Fund’s Holly Pearen likened this to taking economic considerations into account when diagnosing a heart attack.* Economic trade-offs might be relevant in shaping a plan to protect a species, but they should have no bearing on the analysis of whether a species is endangered. The Interior Department insists that listing decisions will be made based on science, not economics. So then why waste resources on economic analysis during the listing process?>The administration also would shift how the Interior Department treats threatened species, the level just below endangered. Instead of automatically giving them the same protections as endangered species, the government would tailor plans for each threatened species. This sounds reasonable in theory. But the Trump administration has earned little trust that it would use additional flexibility wisely. *This is an administration that regularly derides experts and ignores environmental facts* — see, for example, its avowed effort to cut experts from the Agriculture Department by relocating their jobs away from Washington.> A third change would make it more difficult for Interior Department experts to take climate change into account as they decide whether to list species as threatened or consider how to preserve their habitat. Again, it would be easier to accept the administration’s assurances that these shifts would be harmless if its senior members were not hostile to the reality of human-caused climate change. As a recent U.N. report underscored, global warming presents an existential challenge to species across the planet; more than ever, the nation needs a species-preservation program informed by this fact.

This Ipsos poll shows at least three different things: Biden is the front runner by a wide margin, there's at least three different candidates in third place, and that the other candidates are far behind. Notice that only ten candidates have been listed above--the rest are below one percent nationally. To compare apples to oranges, compare the Ipsos data to the other data seen in all the other national polls. They are in general agreement with the above information. That data implies: Biden has seen a bump in support, there's a good fight for third place going on right now, and that other candidates are falling behind. Here's the current bad info for the other candidates seen in most polls: * Sanders has widespread name recognition yet he's polling in second place. At this point, it seems like his support has capped or has consolidated to his base but his numbers are either stagnated or slowly dropping. Some have pointed out that his support with young people seem to be declining.

In practice, the United States has accumulated a large structural debt that is on course to grow at $1 trillion per year, barring major policy changes. And partisan polarization has risen to the point where it’s in politicians’ interest to posture by opposing debt-limit extensions, even at the risk of an economically destabilizing default.

Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.) proposed a prudent fix on Tuesday.

This ceiling would apply unless, within 15 legislative days, Congress passed a joint resolution of disapproval — subject to presidential veto. If, during the year, the federal debt reached within $250 billion of the limit, the president would issue an explanation and request a higher limit, and the approval process would be repeated. Abortion is a constitutional right. Those on the right have gone to great lengths to restrict abortions. For example, women have to deal with forced ultrasound laws and fake health centers.

Ultrasounds are not medically necessary for an abortion and should only be used for medical purposes not political ones.Fake health centers (crisis pregcy centers) are designed to get women in the door but are intended to persuade women not to consider an abortion.

Such visits raise questions about whether patronizing Trump’s private business is viewed as a way to influence public policy, critics said.> > ...> But the T-Mobile case stands out because the company’s executives were expected at the hotel so soon after announcing they needed a win in Washington.> > “It’s currying favor with the president. It’s disturbing, because it’s another secret avenue for currying favor with the government,” said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics.> > She said that even if they weren’t directly ordered by Trump, the president’s appointees might feel pressured to help Trump’s customers. That might undermine public confidence in the decisions that result, Krumholz said. > Ambassador Norm Eisen, a former Obama administration ethics czar and U.S. ambassador to the Czech Republic who now serves as a fellow at the Brookings Institution, and Barry Berke, a prominent defense attorney and co-chairman of the litigation department at New York law firm Kramer Levin, are set to join the key committee as special oversight counsels to help organize Democrats’ investigative plans related to the Justice Department and special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, the committee announced Tuesday.> > The two have been vocal critics of the Trump White House on television and in opinion columns, and have written extensively about the potential obstruction of justice case against the president.

The House Judiciary Committee is determined to ask critical questions, gather all the information, judiciously assess the evidence, and make sure that the facts are not hidden from the American people.”> > Among the specific areas of interest for Nadler are probing President Trump’s frequent criticism of the department and Mueller’s team, and whether the president has tried to obstruct the special counsel’s efforts to probe Russian meddling in the 2016 election. > SACRAMENTO — Governor Gavin Newsom today announced that he has signed a General Order rescinding previous authorization for California National Guard operations at the U.S.-Mexico border that allowed California National Guard personnel to perform duties traditionally undertaken by the federal government there.> >**“The Border ‘emergency’ is a manufactured crisis.

There is no reason to defend payday lenders’ ability to issue loans that are, by definition, unaffordable, unless your goal is to prop up a predatory industry at the expense of consumers. This payday predator protection plan is a huge mistake and a crystal clear sign of where the Trump Administration sides when it comes to working families.” > Democrats plan to pursue a broad range of investigations into possible conflicts of interest and ethics violations within the Trump administration.

He met with three nonprofit environmental groups during that time....Wheeler's predecessor Pruitt also met frequently with industry representatives. A CNN review in 2017 found that less than 1 percent of Pruitt's meetings were with environmental groups, and in July CNN reported that Pruitt's public calendar omitted more than two dozen meetings, events or calls that were recorded in his internal schedules, some of which included talks with industry executives and attorneys. It’s more than likely because he doesn’t show up in any national poll and if he does it’s generally in the “Other” category.

Our legal system saw this problem coming.*By Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D RI)In the ongoing Senate impeachment trial, the White House’s defense of President Donald Trump hinges on keeping damning documents and witness testimony out of evidence. That is why, for the first time in our history, a president has defied every request for documents and witnesses from House impeachment investigators, and gone to extraordinary lengths to stop members of his own administration from testifying.We have a party, in a trial, who controls the witnesses who know his true conduct, and that party is using that control to block important witnesses from testifying.Our legal system saw this problem coming.The “missing witness” rule, a longstanding common-law rule that the U.S. Supreme Court first discussed in 1893 in Graves v. United States, allows one party to obtain an adverse inference against the other for failure to produce a witness under that party’s control with material information—an inference that the testimony would be harmful to them. Similar principles allow an adverse inference when a party refuses to turn over relevant documents. These rules prevent obstinate parties from abusing “costly and time consuming” court proceedings to subvert their legal duty to produce relevant evidence, as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit noted in International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) v. National Labor Relations Board.On Wednesday, I asked the House managers whether senators should draw an adverse inference regarding witnesses and documents withheld by the Trump administration. Witnesses like former national security adviser John Bolton, White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Assistant to the President Robert Blair, and top Office of Management and Budget (OMB) official Michael Duffey have direct knowledge of the president’s efforts to block aid to Ukraine. Documents at the Department of State, OMB and the Department of Defense corroborate the stories of career civil servants, who defied Trump’s blockade and testified before the House.Sometimes it is proper to exclude relevant evidence from a trial. Evidence may be unduly prejudicial or subject to a valid assertion of privilege. Parties can then file motions to compel or motions in limine. They make their case document by document and witness by witness.However, a litigant cannot unilaterally decide what evidence is presented—and that is just what the White House attempted, and what my Republican colleagues in the Senate are ready to allow. The White House’s refusal to produce these materials to Congress is particularly wrongful because they are releasing subpoenaed documents—often heavily redacted—through Freedom of Information Act requests.There is a well-established procedure for the assertion of executive privilege; the president has never exercised it. Had he, it would have required privilege logs and triggered a process of negotiation and accommodation to balance the institutional interest the president has in confidential communications against Congress’ institutional interest in conducting oversight. But here we have a White House saying, no witness, no documents, no way, no how.This takes us to the White House counsel’s defense against drawing an adverse inference: the argument that they interposed meritorious, good-faith objections and privileges. This does not pass scrutiny in my view. We heard arguments about absolute immunity—arguments that have been rejected by every court that has ruled on the issue. We heard claims that a vote of the full House on impeachment was required for standing committees to authorize subpoenas—claims that have no basis in the Constitution or the House rules, and overlook House oversight powers. Trump’s lawyers claim we lack the evidence to impeach the president, while the president has bragged, “We have all the material. They don’t have the material.” They have faulted the House for not enforcing subpoenas in court, while arguing in court that courts are powerless to enforce them. The White House blockade does not evidence good faith and merit.An added indication of the White House’s intent is their argument that calling witnesses will cause the Senate impeachment trial to grind to a halt while the parties go to court to litigate issues of privilege. That argument has no basis. The Constitution mentions no such review, and the Supreme Court has held that courts have “no role” in a Senate impeachment, in Nixon v. United States. The Senate, with the assistance of the presiding officer, has always decided questions of privilege in impeachments, without parties resorting to the federal courts. There is no support for this assertion.In the face of that brand of total obstruction, senators are well justified to turn to the missing witness rule and draw the adverse inference.Alternatively, the Senate can solve this problem. We can issue subpoenas. We have an able chief justice sitting as our presiding officer to settle evidentiary disputes. But if my Republican colleagues decide a full and fair trial is not in the interest of the Senate, the law gives us a roadmap to fill in the resulting gaps: We can draw adverse inferences. In such circumstances, “[s]ilence then becomes evidence of the most convincing character,” as Justice Harlan Stone noted in the high court’s 1939 ruling, Interstate Circuit v. United States.*Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse represents Rhode Island in the U.S. Senate. A former Rhode Island attorney general and U.S. attorney, Whitehouse serves on the Senate Judiciary, Budget, Fice, and Environment and Public Works committees.* >For the United States, the answers are especially worrying because the government has intentionally rendered itself incapable.

The remedy for egregious state election actions is to sue the state in federal court, which is regularly done, and sometimes in state court, too, as happened in Pennsylvania with their redistricting where it potentially violated the state's constitution. As a general rule of thumb, a presidential executive order can be anything that (1) doesn't violate or contradict something passed by Congress and (2) doesn't violate the Constitution. > What about an executive order addressing how congressional districts are drawn?

Unless, of course, Bolton's allegations are true.>>Remember: While Trump wants to wrap this thing up as quickly as possible, it’s not the case that Bolton’s claims will remain under wraps if he isn’t called to testify. He wrote them in a book, due for release in mid-March. Even if Bolton doesn’t testify, the claims he makes impugning Trump will be made public — unless the White House tries to block them on national security grounds. That certainly seems like it’s within the realm of possibility, but, given that this claim is already public, it seems as though that might not survive a court challenge. The news has been all over the map on this today. It could be a psych game going on with leadership of both parties.Cory Gardner has come out against witnesses and that's not good, given he's one of the Senate's most vulnerable incumbents. >Trump is ... leading an administration that is chaotic and fractious.

I think it's a safe bet Trump didn't go to college because he was interested in receiving an education. He probably went primarily to avoid the draft and, secondarily, because he and/or his father thought having a degree from Wharton somehow was a selling point for him professionally. Trump's degree is not from Wharton's MBA program, of course, which is the prestigious degree. My uncle went to Wharton a few years after Trump. He says that during the time Trump was there, cheating was rampant. Rich students routinely paid graduate students to sit their exams for them and to complete their papers for them.Trump has bragged in interviews he never went to class nor read any of the required texts when he was an undergraduate, and given his penchant for unethical behavior, it's certainly conceivable he could have paid some students to take his exams and do his papers for him.

That's when the new Congress and new Senators will be sworn into office and get to work. So articles of impeachment with no trial would be dead. The House would need to impeach Trump again. Hopefully, Trump will be defeated in November 2020's election, so his last day in office will be January 20, 2021, and no impeachment is thus needed.

Trump, for instance, declined to respond after Iran allegedly struck key Saudi oil facilities last September, a surprisingly subdued response for an administration that has said protecting Saudi Arabia is a policy priority. >“Hey, John, what’s this all about?

In the past, in some states, the party with an incumbent did not hold a primary simply because there was no challenger. It was a time- and cost-saving thing.This year with Republicans, however, it's different.The GOP leadership is terrified that an anti-Trump Republican who manages to survive to the convention would be given a platform to speak out against Trump. So they've been convincing states to cancel their GOP primaries to starve off Trump's several challengers. Sanders is not the only one in the top tier of candidates. > no one needs her to win her stateTrue, but that's not why she'd be attractive to some candidates in the number-one slot.

There's a reason more primitive peoples used it as mortar. I count eleven states where there will be no GOP primary or caucus.Josef Stalin would be so proud. The bottom line is that this would be uncharted waters. The Supreme Court, not the Senate, has the final say on interpreting the Constitution. But what if the USSC says the Senate must hold a Senate trial and the Senate refuses to do so, saying the Supremes are wrong. How would the High Court enforce its ruling? A true constitutional crisis would result — a circumstance where the Constitution does not provide a remedy. https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/eo59k7/the_supreme_court_can_review_an_unfair/ >If Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell follows through on his desire to hold an abbreviated impeachment trial without witnesses — as many in his party would prefer — he will be testing the limits of the impeachment trial clause of the Constitution. Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer has declared that a trial without witnesses (or perhaps even any documents) would amount to “a coverup.” Worries about a rubber-stamp trial are one reason House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has delayed submitting the articles of impeachment.>>If such a sham trial comes to pass, is there any remedy? In fact, there is a stronger case than many think that the Supreme Court has the power to review impeachment trials, to ensure that Senate procedures meet a basic level of fairness. > There's no judicial authority to do anything to the Senate.It's a constitutional question, not a question about Senate rules. > it'll take a couple of years to wind through judicial challenges if the Senate did thatFederal courts and the Supreme Court expedite cases where timeliness is critical. The 2000 election case is a good example of that (albeit a horrible final decision). > Technically speaking, the constitution does not require a trial.That theory is merely a theory. It has never been tested judicially. Others disagree. The Constitution requires a trial. The Senate cannot subvert that.That aside, it would be politically damaging to just summarily dismiss the impeachment articles. It won't hurt Senators in deep red states, but it almost certainly would hurt those in states further to the middle if it appeared the Senate was so corrupt as to attempt to sweep an impeachment under the carpet.

These numbers suggest that the fate of the 2020 election really stands in the hands of the voters who don’t like Trump. **Trump does not have enough people who like him to get reelected: the only way he does is if the voters who don’t like him refuse to get on the same page after the Democratic primary is over.**>>Right now we see a lot of people saying they will vote for Biden but not Bernie or will vote for Bernie but not Biden. If those people get on the same page once the nominee is chosen, Trump will lose. >The reality of Donald Trump — an amoral narcissist with no capacity for reflection or personal growth — is evident from his decades in public life.

Trump has nominated thirteen that were later withdrawn because McConnell told the White House they could not be confirmed. Rather than fail to be confirmed, they were yanked.>That process is deeply broken.I agree. Awful people are being nominated. Fortunately, however, the absolute worst are not quite clearing the very low hurdle.And if there is a silver lining to this cloud, it's the fact that historically under-qualified judges tend not to stay on the bench for long because they're lured away by lucrative sweetheart deals at prestigious law firms. > judges McConnell just confirmed who have no real legal experienceI think you're equating trial experience with legal experience, which are two different things. The ABA "not qualified" judges whom Trump has nominated lack trial experience but not legal experience. Sarah Pitlyk and Justin Walker, for instance, were rated "not qualified" by the ABA primarily because they have no trial experience. However, both have legal experience.Many/most of the people Trump has nominated for the bench are awful, but I don't think any of them are quite as awful as Duncan Hunter. I don't think even Trump is that tone deaf. Hunter is not a member of the California Bar, so either he did not pass the bar exam or never took it. His law school only has a 58 percent pass rate. While you don't have to be a member of the bar to be nominated as a judge — you don't even have to have a law degree — someone who has never passed the bar has no real-world experience in the law and thus would likely not be confirmed by the Senate. If Trump was impeached and removed, Pence would become President. He could nominate a new Vice President, who would then have to be confirmed by both houses of Congress. If he was impeached before he could nominate a veep, then Pelosi would become the President. >What the nation needs to know most urgently is whether there was any substantive intelligence indicating that Suleimani was orchestrating a major military or terrorist campaign against the United States.

Soviet show trials did not have witnesses. Great precedent. The impeachment managers will determine who would be subpoenaed for the prosecution, and those managers will be chosen by the House leadership. (Impeachment managers act like prosecutors in the impeachment trial.) The defense may also call witnesses.Hence, if witnesses are allowed and the impeachment managers want him, then the Senate leadership won't be able to block Bolton. However, if the rules they adopt allow for no witnesses, then he would be blocked that way. Nonetheless, if they allow no witnesses, it's difficult for them to claim it was an objective, fair trial. > dismiss for lack of prosecutionHe cannot do that. The Constitution requires a trial.

Lankford is the second Republican Senator to criticize Trump today. This could be a deliberate GOP scheme to have some Republican Senators make critical remarks about Trump over the next few weeks so they *seem* to be objective and distancing themselves from Trump.

Previous Presidents typically stood with guests to the Oval Office or sat with them on the sofa/chair arrangement on the other side of the office. Picture posing usually was a stand-up affair with the President in the middle.Trump, however, typically receives guests while seated at the Resolute desk. Pictures are posed with him seated at the desk. I suspect this is for two primary reasons: (1) the desk hides Trump's obesity and (2) it's emblematic of his narcissism. Symbols of power seem to be important to Trump more than actual power, e.g. he talks tough but is obsequious to people like Putin.In a sense, that desk is like a throne to him.

High membership subs get prominence on the front page and in the communities listing, so they already are giving a preference to big subreddits where it actually matters more than something as esoteric as stickies.If you've already lobbied them and they were not receptive, then a second try will go nowhere. Believe me, I've tried with them before on important issues like users who chronically harass and dox. Once they make a decision, they are utterly inflexible about reconsidering something.

Here is the complete text:*Plaintiffs Urge Court to Increase $100K Sanction of Betsy DeVos’ Education Department*Lawyers for former Corinthian College students are asking a federal judge in San Francisco to increase the amount of sanctions the Department of Education must pay for violating a court order barring the collection of certain student loan payments.Lawyers at Housing and Economic Rights Advocates in Oakland and the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School have asked U.S. District Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim of the Northern District of California to reconsider the $100,000 sanction order she issued in October. Kim in May issued an order putting a hold on all government collection on loans that were subject to “borrower defense” to repayment, or the contention that borrowers were defrauded by the for-profit school. The judge held Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and the Education Department in contempt and sanctioned them in October for continuing to collect on loans despite her order. In court papers filed Monday, the plaintiffs lawyers contend that records provided by the government at the time of her October ruling were “grossly inaccurate.” They contend that the government’s representations that it had violated the order 16,000 times by seeking to collect from individuals covered by Kim’s injunction was “off by almost 300%” and that the government has collected more than $21 million from individuals who are lawfully covered by the injunction since it went into place. “Defendants’ ongoing noncompliance is unfortunate, disturbing, and harmful,” wrote the plaintiffs lawyers. The filings did not specify what amount of sanctions the plaintiffs would find appropriate, but the lawyers did submit testimony from former Corinthian students who had become homeless or faced ficial hardship after having wages and tax refunds garnished inappropriately by the government and making payments that fell under the injunction. “And in spite of the shocking information that the scope of Defendant’s noncompliance was grossly understated, and that they continue to violate the injunction, Defendants do not exhibit contrition,” the plaintiffs lawyers wrote. Plaintiffs claim that the Education Department has sought to “downplay and shift blame for the seriousness of their mistakes” by attributing the increase in the number of affected individuals to miscommunication with loan servicers and other “limited” issues. The plaintiffs lawyers also point out that DeVos has publicly characterized Kim’s sanction order as “not appropriate.” The government has appealed the injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth.

Bingo. Before it was a state it was federal territory. 100 percent correct. An asset is something of value, like a painting or real estate.

The Chief Justice does preside over the trial but does not write the rules for how the trial will be conducted. This is what the Constitution says:>When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall presideNo further description is provided as to his or her duties. So, in many ways, he/she serves as a referee.

It could be done with a paper ballot, with Senators filing by a ballot box and sliding their vote inside. He could, but given Trump's extreme narcissism, don't hold your breath waiting for that to happen. Having a majority of Senators voting to convict — even if two-thirds can't be reached — would send a very powerful message. The likelihood of that happening would increase if (1) the vote was secret and/or (2) conviction was contingent on censure as punishment but not removal. So your question is can (a) Trump be convicted, (b) but not removed from office, (c) yet barred for running for reelection?Steps (a) and (b) can definitely happen.

McConnell has already said publicly that if the House votes articles of impeachment and forwards them to the Senate, then the Senate will hold a full trial. The House Intelligence Committee will issue a report for the House Judiciary Committee, which will be submitted this week. Judiciary will review the report and hold its own hearings. Once that process is completed, they will determine if articles of impeachment are warranted. If so, those will be drafted and voted on by Judiciary. Any articles that are approved by Judiciary then go to the full House for a final vote. If the full House votes for any such articles, they then are forwarded to the Senate, where Donald Trump's trial will occur. It may not have stood up yet. Puppies of breeds with standing ears start out in life with flopped over ears. The ears stand sometime during their puppyhood, usually by six months of age.

Remember, an article of impeachment need not involve a crime. One article might be abuse of power and/or contempt of Congress. Neither are crimes that could result in criminal prosecution were he not President. Another could be violating the Emoluments Clause. Again, not a crime.However, he could face criminal charges once he leaves office for offense that are not raised in the impeachment, such as tax fraud, money laundering, etc. It's justsecurity.org. It's very reliable and published by a legitimate thinktank affiliated with New York University's School of Law. Impeachment will have zero effect on any criminal prosecutions Donald Trump faces, federal or state, when he leaves office. Impeachment is a political process, not a criminal prosecution. That's why the most serious penalty is removal from office and also why impeachment and removal cannot be appealed. Articles of impeachment cannot be pardoned, even if the Senate does not remove him. Whether or not Trump is impeached and whether or not he's removed from office by the Senate, that will have utterly no effect on any criminal prosecution, state or federal, once he leaves office. > May be because they did not import black slaves for hundreds of years?Russia enslaved their own people instead as serfs. >The fact that this one story dominated the narrative about Clinton seemed to have an effect on voters… On the other hand, people remembered many different news stories about Donald Trump over time.

One of the first times the public saw Nixon in glasses was the day he resigned. https://www.lawfareblog.com/timeline-trump-ukraine-scandal *Complete text, if this is paywalled for you:*Look, the case has been made. Almost everything in the impeachment hearings this week fleshed out and backed up the charge that President Trump muscled Ukraine for political gain. The pending question is what precisely the House and its Democratic majority will decide to include in the articles of impeachment, what statutes or standards they will assert the president violated.What was said consistently undermined Mr. Trump’s case, but more deadly was what has never been said. In the two months since Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry was under way and the two weeks since the Intelligence Committee’s public hearings began, no one, even in the White House, has said anything like, “He wouldn’t do that!” or “That would be so unlike him.” His best friends know he would do it and it’s exactly like him.The week’s hearings were not a seamless success for Democrats. On Tuesday they seemed to be losing the thread. But by Wednesday and Thursday it was restored.Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman was not a persuasive witness and did not move the story forward, because in spite of the obvious patriotism reflected in his record he was annoying—smug and full of himself. He appeared in full dress uniform with three rows of ribbons. When Rep. Devin Nunes called him “Mr. Vindman,” he quickly corrected him: “Ranking Member, it’s Lieutet Colonel Vindman, please.” Oh, snap. As he described his areas of authority at the National Security Council, he seemed to glisten with self-regard. You got the impression he saw himself as fully in charge of U.S. policy toward Ukraine. Asked if it was true that government offered to make him their defense minister he said “yes” with no apparent embarrassment. I don’t know about you but I don’t like it when a foreign government gets a sense of a U.S. military officer and concludes he might fit right in. (A Ukrainian official later said the job offer was a joke.)Mr. Vindman—I’m sorry, Lt. Col. Vindman—self-valorized, as other witnesses have, and tugged in his opening statement on America’s heart strings by addressing his father, who brought his family from the Soviet Union 40 years ago: “Dad, . . . you made the right decision. . . . Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth.”The committee has paid entirely too much attention to the witnesses’ emotions. “How did that make you feel?” “Without upsetting you too much, I’d like to show you the excerpts from the call . . .”I am sure the questioners were told to take this tack by communications professionals who believe this is how you manipulate housewives. In fact a mother at home with a vacuum in one hand and a crying baby in the other would look at them, listen, and think: “You guys represent us to other countries? You gotta butch up.”Later, as Col. Vindman returned to work, and clearly wanting to be seen, he posed grinning for photos in front of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.It is not only Donald Trump who suffers from Absence of Gravity.On Wednesday Gordan Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, was both weirdly jolly and enormously effective in doing Mr. Trump damage. He followed the president’s orders; there was a quid pro quo; “everyone was in the loop, it was no secret“; Rudy Giuliani was the point man, with whom Mr. Sondland worked “at the express direction of the president.”It was his third try at truthful sworn testimony and it was completely believable. It was kind of the ballgame. He seemed like a guy with nothing to lose, or maybe a guy who’d already lost much.On Thursday Fiona Hill, the former White House Russia expert, was all business, a serious woman you don’t want to mess with. She reoriented things, warning that those who excuse or don’t wish to see Russian propaganda efforts against America, and targeting its elections, are missing the obvious. The suspicion of the president and his allies that Ukraine is the great culprit in the 2016 election is a “fictional narrative.” They are, in fact, bowing to disinformation Russia spreads to cover its tracks and confuse the American people and its political class. She dismissed the president’s operatives’ efforts to get Ukraine’s new president to investigate his country’s alleged meddling as a “domestic political errand.” She and other diplomats were “involved in national security, foreign policy,” and the interests of the operatives and the diplomats had “diverged.” She warned Mr. Sondland: “This is all going to blow up.”Truer words.What became obvious in the hearings was the sober testimony from respectable diplomats—not disgruntled staffers with nutty memoirs but people of stature who don’t ordinarily talk—about how the administration operates. It became clear in a new and public way that pretty much everyone around the president has been forced for three years to work around his poor judgment and unpredictability in order to do their jobs. He no doubt knows this and no doubt doesn’t care. Because he’s the boss, they’ll do it his way.But we saw how damaging this is, how ultimately destructive, not only to coherence and respectability but to the president himself.After Thursday’s hearings I felt some free-floating sympathy for high Trump appointees who joined early. You can say they knew what they signed up for, but it’s human to have hope, and they surely had it when they came aboard. They were no doubt ambitious—they wanted a big job—but they probably wanted to do good, too. They were optimistic—“How bad can it be?” And there would have been vanity—“I can handle him.” But they couldn’t. He not only doesn’t know where the line is; he has never wanted to know, so he can cross it with impunity, without consciousness of a bad act or one that might put him in danger. They were no match for his unpredictability and resentments, which at any moment could undo anything.As to impeachment itself, the case has been so clearly made you wonder what exactly the Senate will be left doing. How will they hold a lengthy trial with a case this clear? Who exactly will be the president’s witnesses, those who’d testify he didn’t do what he appears to have done, and would never do it?Procedures, rules and definitions aren’t fully worked out in the Senate. But we are approaching December and the clock is ticking. A full-blown trial on charges most everyone will believe are true, and with an election in less than a year, will seem absurd to all but diehards and do the country no good.So the reasonable guess is Republican senators will call to let the people decide. In a divided country this is the right call. But they should take seriously the idea of censuring him for abuse of power. Mr. Trump would be the first president to be censured since Andrew Jackson, to whom his theorists have always compared him. In the end he will probably be proud of a tightening of the connection. Trump looks like a petulant child in that photo.Melania looks like her MD went a little overboard with the Botox. It's actually part of a longer quote: "This was not an angel, this woman, okay? There are a lot of things that she did that I didn't like and we will talk about that at some time, but I just want to let you know, this was not a baby that we’re dealing with."Thus it seems in Donny's mind a *baby* is a nice, compliant woman who says nice things about him. Postal regulations require the current President's photo to be hung on every post office wall. They don't say *where* in the post office, however. So the postmaster of our local post office hung Trump's photo inside a closet.When I took my grandmother to her local Social Security office about a month ago, I noticed they had Barack Obama's photo on the wall. No sign of Trump. I've never seen the show. Are the hosts real obsequious? That or a drama queen. Yes. It's from her opening statement linked in the post. I don't know what all the fuss is about. It's perfectly normal for the jury to sit down with a defendant before a trial and plan how long it should last.^/s [That's Terri Sewell, who represents Alabama's 7th District.](https://ballotpedia.org/Terri_Sewell) This is off topic for us but something they'd love at r/enoughtrumpspam. >I really wish this would change things but I'm afraid it won't.

White House officials, including acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, have announced they will not be cooperating with the Democrats’ probe.Burck, a former George W. Bush senior aide, represented former Trump chief political strategist Steve Bannon, former Trump White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and former White House Counsel Donald McGahn during the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections.He was also lead counsel for Maureen McDonnell, former First Lady of the Commonwealth of Virginia, in a federal criminal case charging her and her husband, former Virginia Gov. Robert McDonnell, with corruption charges, and represented New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft in his case against the state of Florida.Burck represented the GOP-controlled House in its suits against the Affordable Care Act during the Obama administration. He eventually left the case in October of 2014, just as his predecessor, David Rivkin of Baker Hostetler, did the month prior.During the contentious Kavanaugh hearings in September of 2018, Burck was part of a group of attorneys charged with reviewing material from Kavanaugh’s days in the George W. Bush White House. The group was given authority to censor certain material, which did not go over well with Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee and elevated public discussion around those involved, including Burck.More recently Burck registered as a “foreign agent” for a Kuwaiti company, shown in disclosures made to the Justice Department, in August of 2019. Burck and the four other attorneys that signed up with him were were the first attorneys from Quinn Emanuel to register under the Foreign Agent Registration Act.Burck also has a notable list of domestic corporate clients, including Boeing, AIG and PPG Industries, and has also worked with foreign companies such as Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht Group, Singapore-based Trafigura and Paris-based FIFA.Burck declined to comment.

Dare one ask, then, who is Piggy? When the capitol was located in Vichy, France was never part of the German Reich. That's why both the US and the UK had embassies in Vichy until 1944. Where is the word "Nazi" in the title?Are you referring to "Vichy"? [It's a city in France.](https://www.ville-vichy.fr/) It's not a "Nazi word." I am sorry but you are not correct."Whomever" here is the *objective pronoun* in this sentence:>And, some might even be inspired to vote for whomeverNotice how "whomever" is preceded by a preposition? Big clue.Compare these two sentences:>Some might even be inspired to vote for he.>>Some might even be inspired to vote for him.The latter, obviously, is correct because an *objective pronoun* is needed while the first one is wrong. For that same reason, I used "whomever" because it is the correct *objective pronoun*.As for this phrase:>is the Democratic nomineeThat is a subordinate clause describing the *objective pronoun*. It is not a separate sentence. > Only 18 percent.That's actually a good number. That means those people are not inclined to vote for Trump again. They may just end up staying home on election day or not voting in the presidential race and just voting the downballot races. And, some might even be inspired to vote for whomever is the Democratic nominee.Trump is ignoring the middle and hoping his base will somehow turnout in massive numbers for him. That's a very weak position. So a loss of his base, with no middle backing him up, hits him doubly hard. Not exactly on topic, but Trump really looks like shit in the photo used with this article. Anxiety, mental illness, and sleep deprivation are taking their toll. Paywall workarounds:https://outline.com/SZFaxjhttp://archive.is/9L5x7 The drop in support is still very important. That one-fourth of Republicans will be more inclined to stay at home on election day, which hurts Trump. GOPers will soon rue the day they bleated for hearings to be public when the witness transcripts are released from the closed-door hearings. Everyone will learn all about how Trump abused power repeatedly, aided by his corrupt handmaidens Guliani, Barr, Pompeo, Perry, Muvaney, and more. But that won't be anything like the live televised gavel-to-gavel hearings when witness after witness will publicly testify about the gross corruption plaguing Trump and his administration. They are about to get hit by a tsunami of transparency. >The other 47 states in the middleWashington DC is not a state.All the states that aren't NY and CA aren't "in the middle." Some of them are to the east or south of NY. Some are to the north of CA. Some are more liberal than NY and CA.>Soviet secret basement hearingA curious historical reference there. ;) >Said Judge Katanji Brown Jackson: “We don’t live in a world where your status as a former executive branch official somehow shields you or prevents you from giving information.” > he will never be removed Republicans thought that about Nixon. Until they stopped thinking that about Nixon. So the thirteen witnesses who have testified against Trump in recent weeks and verified that there was quid pro quo are all part of the hoax? But how could that be possible, given many are Republicans who were appointed by Trump himself? I'm not talking about the vacancies. I'm talking about the three Republicans who did not vote. They are:Jody B. Hice (GA 10)John W. Rose (TN 6)William R. Timmons (SC 4) The impeachment process occurs entirely within the House. Impeachment is like an indictment. If the House votes to impeach, then the Senate holds a trial to determine if Trump is (1) guilty of the charges and (2) if guilty, then should he be removed from office. Are you talking about the Dems or the Republicans? The two "no" Dem votes were from MN and NJ, both very red districts.I was asking about the three Republicans who did not vote. Anyone know the story on the three GOPers who did not vote? Were these deliberate absences by people in swingy districts who would be defeated because of a no vote yet primaried for a yes vote? From *Politico*:>The defections came from Rep. Jeff Van Drew (D-N.J.), a freshman and vocal impeachment critic, and Rep. Colin Peterson (D-Minn.), whose district went for Trump by 30 points in 2016. That's why people who insisted "both sides are the same" before the election were particularly maddening. Collin C. Peterson (MN-7) and Jeff Van Drew (NJ-2). Correct. But he's still a Republican in all but name. > Even Mitt, the one that said he's willing to hear the facts and make a decision after hearing them voted no or didn't vote.This was a House vote.

I agree with Funky Duck. The Trump Admin is too incompetent to mastermind a stealth operative like you're suggesting. Yes. Apparently his attorneys have conveyed to Congress that he will honor a subpoena.Executive privilege is not a blanket privilege. If it doesn't involve national security and Morrison wasn't directly interacting with POTUS, then it's hard to claim executive privilege. For instance, if Morrison was just listening in on the call in another room, as typically happens, there was no interaction with Trump. I don't agree. Yes, some will back Trump, but I don't think Roberts will. He will join with the four liberals and rain on Donny's parade.Roberts is concerned with his legacy. He doesn't want to be known as the CJ who gave Trump a blank check. If they don't comply, they will be held in contempt. The judge could order stiff fines for each day of non-compliance. Which one? The one with the "Trump speaks during the 9th Shale Insight Conference" caption? No no. A petition for certiorari is filed with the USSC on a case, which is a request for an appeal. More than 99 percent of those are denied. Once a case is denied, that's it. Appeals are exhausted.If, however, the USSC does take up a review, issues an opinion, and remands the case to a lower court for further action, that further action could them be appealed but on different grounds/issues/matters than the original appeal.For instance, let's say a criminal sentencing is appealed to the USSC. They say the sentence is too harsh and remand. They don't tell the lower court what the sentence must be, just that it's too harsh. It goes to the lower court for reconsideration and the new ruling is then appealed. It could go back to the USSC. As much as we're enjoying this F5riday, just think of some of the F5ridays to come, like when the HIC releases transcripts of the various witness testimonies and during the public hearings next month. It will go to the US Court of Appeals before it goes to the USSC. The USCA must hear the appeal. It's discretionary at the USSC level.A single case can go before the USSC several times, but not on issues previously decided. The USSC can remand a case, and then matters during the remand are then appealed back up the USSC. Exceptions were made during the Watergate proceedings and this dovetails nicely into that precedent. That enormously unprofessional letter is a ticking bomb that will continue to pay dividends for Trump's adversaries. I don't think so. Morrison lawyered up early and his legal counsel approached the HIC. I don't think the Trump administration could be so carefully duplicitous to send him in as a plant. In a rational world, yes, but... It would depend on whether he even has access to any of the materials. He departed the DoJ several weeks after he concluded his investigation. Presumably he took no files with him. > The D.C. Circuit is a given affirmationI don't think we can be that optimistic. This first would go to a three-judge panel on  the USCA. The DC Circuit has eighteen judges — eight of whom were nominated by Democratic Presidents and ten nominated by Republicans. So in the random judge draw, the three-judge panel could have two Republicans or even three. > Only SCOTUS can overturn thisSorry, but that's not correct. The DoJ would first appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Today's ruling came from a District Judge, which is the federal trial level court. That's a bit difficult to claim *after* he has testified. That's true. They'll be whining about how the hearing was in secret.Hey, if they're all for triumphing openness over secrecy, they can get behind releasing Trump's tax returns to the public! > a lot of pollsNot all of them are on the DNC approved list.

Only three have qualified so far for December. >To make the December debate, candidates must hit 4 percent support in at least four DNC-approved polls of primary voters nationally or in early-voting states (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina) — or, instead, they can qualify by hitting 6 percent in two approved early-state polls. Candidates must also bring in donations from 200,000 unique donors, with a minimum of 800 donors in 20 states, territories or the District of Columbia.That will significantly thin the ranks. >He is believed to be involved on the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which Trump pressed the foreign leader to open an investigation into one of his top 2020 political rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden.>>Morrison is also seen as an official who can corroborate the testimony of William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine who offered what Democrats described as the "most powerful" testimony earlier this week.The GOP whined about "hearsay."

Yea it's all a conspiracy. Meanwhile the rest of of us will support the democratic party regardless of who wins. Because we are democrats. Bernie got his ass kicked. You can spin it any way you want. He wasn't even close. LOL. I wish I could believe that. After enduring three years of constant blaming, it's hard to believe otherwise.   Hope I'm wrong but I sincerely doubt it. When he loses the primary, who will you blame then?Never mind, we already know. The DNC, the media, the system, corporations, the rules and bla bla bla bla bla. Another rinse and repeat of 2016. Using right-wing sources to make your case. I love the smell of desperation in the afternoon. Saying it does not make it true. LOL - God the Bernie army's whining knows no limits.

Hundreds of bills passed by the House sit DOA on Mitch McConnell's desk. Trump just 	repealed or weakened nearly 100 environmental rules and laws, loosening or eliminating rules on climate change, clean air, chemical pollution, coal mining, oil drilling, endangered species protections and making it easier for cities to keep dumping raw sewage into rivers by letting them delay or otherwise change federally imposed fixes to their sewer systems. Predictions claim it will poison 60% of the nation’s waterwaysI  know you are talking about what to do with all the refugees climate change creates. But the obvious solution is not to create them in the first place. Trump is the number one reason in the entire world they will be created. No, I am saying there will not be any progress toward solving this problem as long as Trump is president. When your ship is sinking, the first thing you need to do is plug the leak. Anything else is just lipstick on a pig. Trump is the greatest threat to climate change legislation this century. Nothing positive will happen until he is gone.

No but that poll doesn't say what they want to hear. So it's fake..Happy cakeday. :D > lmao the polls showing highest numbers for Biden...,-----------> I didn’t say shit about this poll or any others----------------Make up your mind. Cool. :D Oh so you are saying the polls are wrong now. And when they say differently you will tout how right they are, as you are doing about this one specific poll. It cracks me up how the Bernie folks spin this. They found one poll that says Biden and Bernie are neck-and-neck and almost are claiming victory.  Of course they are downvoting me into hell as I call them out. It's so typical.

I hope it doesn't take too long to rebuild the EPA once Trump is out of office. It  still could stir dialogue on the issue within the fundamentalist stronghold. True, that's possible too. Nevertheless, this would be a great step for the Catholic church to take.It could make it more difficult for the Evangelicals to completely ignore the situation. I think it would. I hope not.

He grew accustomed to breathing through his mouth? Surprising that they are, isn't it? Meanwhile, he reminded fans at a Dallas rally that Texas "made a fortune" off Hurricane Harvey, referring to the money the state received from the federal govt.   He has an extremely warped & scary viewpoint when it comes to 'helping' during & after disasters. Hell yeah. Same in my neck of the woods. "Clap you hands."  Sunday School! Her style drifted over to England for a while. Oops! Give me a chance to do worse.  Promise not to disappoint. You know, when Jimmy Carter tried to do away with it, the other party threw a fit until it was restored.  But, surely a lot has changed since then. Probably not. That remains highly debatable.

Aesha should thank her lucky stars Jack proved to be a dance away lover, leaving an opening for someone far more deserving. I don't think, at this point, that it's about the Catholic church.  Rather, this has everything to do with the right-wing conservatives holding political offices. Or the interpretation thereof. Good luck! Building a protective barrier to protect this very  area from the disasters that have occurred, are occurring,  & will only continue to occur, was proposed to the Republican-run Tx govt over a decade ago.  It has made very little progress, even as side mentions in official meetings about what to do about the rising water, harsher & more frequent storms.  Mostly, any discussions end with the protective barrier 'costing too much'.  Naturally, as time passes, the price grows higher & higher.  The project was proposed by Dr. Bill Merrell of Texas A&M University, after he was trapped for days by flood waters in a high-rise in Houston during Hurricane Ike in 2008.   Afterwards, he spent at least two years living in & studying the amazing water control system in the Netherlands.  Merrell's plan for the upper Tx coast would save entire towns & even small communities, thus saving unique cultures.   The Ike Dike would be able to withstand ~10,000 year storms.Then, after Merrell presented his plan, a team from Rice University came up with a cheaper way to construct a barrier that would protect only the massive industries along the Houston area of the Gulf.  Republicans really liked that one.  To hell with the lives of the regular Joes when there were invisible stock holders to make happy.Not sure where it stands now.  It's hardly mentioned any more, at least not in the news.  And, when it is, it's just about more postponements of any decisions.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ike_Dike Hope so.  We'll see. I look forward to that day. Thanks for such a clear explanation. Yeah, I reread that quote several times when going over the article.  It's beautifully put &  needs to be driven home.  It's shocking that he's even having to say such a thing. Since the home is in the middle of a marsh, I seriously doubt that it's a classic basement located underground.  I've assumed that the 'basement' is the ground floor.  I could very well be wrong about them living in an extension of the barn.  You were surprised to learn they were living 'in the basement', yet I recall being surprised they were living 'in the barn'. ;)  Maybe they occupied both places at different times? Oh, thank you for the insight. Especially when something big happens in the nation politically or economically.  The disaster, no matter how bad or unusual, tends to immediately recede into the background with barely a mention. >*It ended up with Andrew Jackson sending the National Guard to force SC to comply with the law... it was the crystallization of the “state’s rights” strategy* Thank you for taking the time to explain it, make it interesting, & so succinctly too. ;) Okay.  Thanks! Okay, giving that odd-doored closet another look, what I assumed to be a shower faucet could be ventilation.  And, maybe that's all the door is about:  ventilation.  But agree, still peculiar.Thanks so much for the explaining the wash fountain.  That didn't occur to me at all.  I was thinking that it probably had something to do with soaking clothes.Like you, I was also wondering where the original kitchen could've been located.  If in that basement with the wash fountain, then seems the original fireplace should still be discernible, & there *is* that large fireplace jutting out of the wall.To be honest, until it was suggested otherwise, I thought the chipped paint & 'moldy' looking places on the basement walls were part of the decor.  ;) But, unlike in Russia, they can still smoke on their balconies. That'd be amazing. >*the Nullification Crisis*Never heard of this.  Thanks! Not sure how 'thoughtful' they were at restoring it.  The kitchen, especially, reflects the trends of the late '90s - early 2000s.  But, it was probably heavily gutted throughout through the centuries. Yes. >*If it is a shower...*But the door looks wooden & painted.  Special wood?  Fake wood, maybe?>*The round stone thing in the basement is a wash fountain*What's a wash fountain?  I mean, how would it be used?  Is it an item maybe semi-original to the house do you think?  I've never seen anything quite like it.  It looks like it's hooked up to still be used. >*is that the shower with that weird 3/4 door?*So glad you asked!  I couldn't figure it out either.>*what is that weird big round stone looking thing in the basement?*No amount of  studying it helped me figure it out.>*I see toilet paper on the wall, are they like a row of curtained bathroom stalls??*Bless you for asking every major question about the place I had! Yeah, & he seemed to spend most of his time living in his  historical place in town. I thought they lived in an extension to the barn. Do you think that fireplace mantle might actually be original to the house?  So little else appears to be. I've not such a keen eye.  Would you please point out more precisely where you are seeing the most obvious damage? ;) >*I think it’s cool. Definitely unique.*Agree! I  love it. >*Most every pick has been openly hostile to the departments they are supposed to head. It is by design.*Now, it'd be news if those appointed weren't the polar opposite of what is needed. They didn't need posters.  They drew naked cave women directly on the walls. That was a big step.  ;) Republicans have been trying to destroy the EPA for years.  Ironically, they're the ones who created it. Sounds like you're the Mama. ;) Surely not.

Yes, yes, yes. >*We need to have a voterID that is free for all citizens.*Right now, it's just another poll tax reinvented. >*Yes, but the DPS needs to stop charging for a state ID and open more offices.*Especially since the 2nd Bush admin, the few DPS offices remaining are open irregular hours & days.

In other places, like the Congo, giraffe tails are considered a status symbol.''An investigation last year by Humane Society International and the Humane Society of the United States found products representing 4,000 individual giraffes have been imported into the U.S. over the last decade.' That really is the thinking in the part of the Bible Belt I'm in.  It's very extreme & very real. Bravo for that brave guy. I literally gasped, in a good way, when I first read the headline.  I couldn't wait to dive into the story.. British veterinary surgeon, James Herriot, described in his works wild animals appearing at his country home for help.  He accepted that they knew he would help them.  And he did. Yes.  That was such an odd, & frightening, time.  Boots on the ground & all that represented patriotism through militaristic symbols was like a requirement. It'd be great if buses even existed in rural areas of the US. Not only is it not a priority, the Trump admin continues to drastically slash  the 'National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration’s' (NOAA's) budget, crippling its ability to more accurately forecast hurricanes, tornados,  &  floods among other weather conditions.Human lives?  Expendable. Odd how they fail to celebrate their shared beliefs. What's Pence's rule about restaurants & alcohol? I don't know, these days he could be a Republican from just about any state. Nothing but good PR from the new EPA. And it'll be the woman's fault for tempting him just by her presence. His wife should be *very* concerned about his fidelity. I saw an unforgettable documentary about him a long time ago. Like Countess LuAnn, Teddi set herself up for a fall during her first season. Kyle did a good job of imitating Erika as well. Ha!  Perfect summary. Agree.  Camille, alone, rescued this season. There's no real upside? The difference is, the govt is now encouraging people to slaughter them. Don't think this would go over in there. ;) They're still going off where I'm at.  One *just* exploded.  It's in the middle of the day. Thanks!  I appreciate any comment that makes me laugh. Actually, this guy went to the emergency room. This is the first that I've heard of such a thing. This is such a fascinating subject.  It's been a while since I've read anything on it. Your taking the time to explain this in an easy to understand way is much appreciated, CarpetLord.  As it is, doesn't appear that things are looking too good in that area.  I'll pass the info you've been so good to give me on to the others. I'm completely missing the  joke about 'reservoir engineers'.  Clue me in? Thank you.  This is so helpful. This seems like a bad time to be getting rid of it, being the bottom's dropping out in that area, yet not selling it while they can seems a bit foolish as well.  Any opinions or suggestions about this? It's privately owned & in its own field. Oh, this is getting exciting!  Any others? Yeah, this well is on the Gulf Coast.Good grief, this sounds very dangerous. They might take it! Thank you.  That was very informative & far, far beyond anything I've been able to find.Bet they wish they'd sold it when they had a good offer 5 yrs ago. There has been some speculation about storing natural gas, (I think that's what is was), in the salt domes.  Know anything about that? That's for sure.  Being located in the Permian Basin is everything right now. Wow.  That's detailed.  Thanks!  I'll be passing this on to the interested parties. Yes, has been active for decades.  It's in E. Tx in a myriad of salt domes. True. Okay.  But you'd be surprised by how many vegetarians & vegans lack the ability to concoct appetizing  meals for their meat-eating families & friends.As for me, I'll be run out on a rail the next time I serve veggie pizza. ;) Hi cromlyngames, /r/veg would welcome your recipe exchange.  Though small, it has a core group of active members. It doesn't pinpoint 'Corbicula'.  But, here is a description:>*Unlike invasive mussels, they do not attach themselves to pipes or other structures. But in large enough numbers they can clog screens on irrigation pumps or the internal workings of power plants and other water intakes.* Didn't the Green party's 2016 presidential candidate accept money from Russia?  And didn't she support Trump over H. Clinton? Thus prompting the invention of silent lawnmowers. Something like this makes one wonder about the global tradition of bowing one's head & pressing the palms & fingers together, often with the tips of the longest fingers touching the lips. >*The lack of battle scenes.*Perhaps there could've been more military clashes, but I found the restaging of  the   Battle of Gaugamela to be galvanizing.  One of the best battle scenes I've ever seen. I love it. Love this. What the hell? No. If only. Great list.  I'd have to choose Thomas Ravenel. I'll say.  Slade actually made many of us feel sympathetic towards Vicki. What happened to the push for paper ballots? The drinking water in my area hasn't been gaged by the state safe to drink in the past few years, with the exception of a month or two here & there. People use bottled water even to wash their fruits & vegetables. *Vice's* title should read, *How the Drug War is Destroying Our Planet.*Thanks for sharing! Tornados in my area used to be extremely scary experiences.  This spring, they turned into the norm. The Playboy Bunny costume has been done beyond death.  *Yawn.* Making bad decisions is how she wound up in this position.  It's not all that surprising that she continues to do so. I'm left wondering why *any* Housewife would risk entering Florida period. >*I predict that VPR will morph into a modern-day Knott’s Landing.*Ha!  That'd be great. It's been easy for many of us. VPR is a great show to watch for those of us who hate change. ;) I'm prepared for it to go on forever. I found the *photo* of the masts sticking out of the water fascinating.  Have you ever gotten near it? Glad you have access to more than one now. Disaster aid is being delayed by Republicans in other states as well.  Just in time for hurricane season. Most of us tend to think that being stopped in our tracks won't happen to us.  Why would we? Thought provoking. Yes.  So is *Prometheus.* https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-ss-richard-montgomery-information-and-survey-reports One would hope. Russia? I'm pretty sure that's already on it.  ;) The corporations & the state government.  I suppose that's the same thing in Texas. Just Americans? Do you consider having a tooth pulled 'complex' enough? Oh, I see. True, true, true.  In my state, those who can, go to Mexico to have their teeth fixed, mainly due to bad insurance. It's a game, alright. Did marijuana help with the one next to the nerve? >*It’s a matter of patient expectations.*I would think that it has more to do with a patient's degree of pain. Ibuprofen doesn't work for a lot of people, not even for a headache.  So, perhaps it should be lowered from 'king' to 'a royal cousin of aspirin.'  ;) If you experienced such little pain, apparently, that was all you needed. Isn't codeine sold over the counter in places like England & Canada? Oh my God!  Dentists must be burned at the stake or face jail time *immediately.*  /s https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/us/clotilda-slave-ship-alabama.htmlhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-7060411/Officails-Last-slave-ship-Africa-IDd-Alabama-coast.html Your submission is out of date.

U.S. corporations are people who don't pay taxes & receive government rebates.  Sounds like a paradise comparable to living in Denmark.

Someone setting a field of cows on fire *would* be r/nature worthy. I'm able to watch it & do. Republicans traditionally hate the Environmental Protection Agency, even though it was created by their own party in 1970.  As a result, the EPA always suffers when Republicans are in charge.  The same with FEMA. Chewing the cone is the ultimate, You're right.  There's nothing to get.  Racquel  is 'popular' at the moment only because it's currently popular to hate Lala. I have to wonder if Dale is such a black cloud in her daughter's life because she watched Tinsley discard Topper Mortimer & the promising life & social status he afforded her for the rest of her life.  Then, again, perhaps Dale forced Tinsley into marrying Topper.  Does anyone know the background on this? Oh heck.

I bet it's used to being fed & is waiting for food, though we're not suppose to feed the wild animals, of course. My thoughts, exactly. Great news. Well, maybe not *all* the way. How infuriating & scary.  A needless nightmare. Meanwhile, the meat industry is allowed to go out of its way to mislead consumers when it comes to product labels. With mandatory Ketchup to make sure they get a 'vegetable'. Lu could very well be a 'dry drunk' at this stage, hence the behavior. Based strictly on the colors, I like  Ariana & Stassi's best.  Don't care for the designs. In what category would you place it if forced? What do you see replacing it? I'd say it's more about the politics at this particular time. Hopeful, are you? As long as the religious interpretation can be mistaken for compassion, I see little problem.  >*If they want sand so bad, why don't they start dredging the inter-coastal waterway where it will help more people.*Not sure what you mean, jwrig.

Yet, doctors' bills are part of the hospital bills in the end. Not very? It's difficult to imagine the Louisiana government making a mistake that isn't in its own favor. Why am I suppose to be ashamed? Take a wild guess. I think the movie was more about the mental, physical, & emotional zone these people sought in these particular situations.  One of the more memorable scenes was when  Elias Koteas & Deborah Kara Unger were in the backseat of the car as it glided through the carwash.  They were completely & willingly encompassed by machinery beyond their control. I've tried several times.  That probably says more about me rather than the movie. But, I haven't given up hope.  It wouldn't be the first movie I found myself disinterested in on several attempted viewings, only for it to later wind up being a  favorite.   Uh-oh. You're not crazy. Apologies, I was unable to find anything up-to-date & comparable this morning.  *Newsweek* crashed, burned & never recovered after its 'restructuring' in 2008. Under the new ownership, its formerly loyal readers were tossed out along with its quality.  Replace the plastic with drinking cups made of what material? If not, it will be in the future.;) Agree.  Kudos to Cronenberg for taking it on period. But, /u/vauss88, how will you live? I loved the book & couldn't wait to see it.  Sorry, but I was disappointed in the movie.  My expectations were probably beyond too high. I don't doubt that it was. I'd place *Crash* at #1.  Its subject is incredibly vague & unique, but very real.

If that's what I have to do, that's what I'll do. Loved both of these, especially *Gallery Girls.*  It gave an intriguing glimpse into the New York art world.  And some of those girls were really struggling ficially as they tried to make it, which also made it different from most of the Bravo shows. It was unlike any reality show I'd ever seen. Do tell  more!  Nothing about them is 'too boring'. ;) Please let us know. *Loved* this show!  I  found the *NYC Prep* cast members so interesting.

But because human remains are actually rare, we didn’t know just how enormous.

Momma Dee knows she's got a powder keg on her hands when it comes to LeeAnne & is busy protecting her empire, her daughter, & her life. Thanks so much for sharing, seedqueeb! I live in a hunting culture.  They enjoy the hunt & do want to keep the particular animals they kill at a healthy population, else the sport they so enjoy will no longer exist. Most of the hunters I know these days look down on those who don't eat what they kill. That seems to be the new honor code among them.  Which is a great improvement, since that used to not be the case. It's still a tradition here to take a boy on his first hunt.  Last year, an  8-yr-old cousin of mine told me about his uncle shooting & killing a bobcat who was minding his own business up in a tree.  He showed me the gruesome pictures.Thank goodness, my cousin was bothered by the killing & the posing of the photos afterwards.  But, he told me in secret, because he knew that he wasn't suppose to feel that way. Maybe there's hope for the future when it comes to hunting. Yes, yes, yes.  Sickening & scary at the same time. Bring up Russia to a Republican & prepare to get a blank look. Time for robotic animals that can be repaired after being hunted & killed.

I'm sure they'd be happy to lease other parcels of land to the Wildlife Service.  Nothing like making sure you're on their good side. Odd, because there are plenty of places far from people that are stocked with wild animals (including such lions) used as vast canned hunting 'refuges'.   The lions were already captured.  What was  stopping these wildlife officials from finding a proper place for them?  Over & over again, they come off as a trigger-happy agency who take the easiest & cheapest way out, like they're a bunch of good ole boys who like to hunt on the weekends.They're totally beholden to the politicians, not science, the environment, or the animals under their jurisdiction. Heck, they might even be worse than the US Army Corps of Engineers. Amazing.  Thanks! Vatican II made some lousy changes. What a nightmare that would've been.

I started wondering about Stassi's mom way back when she phoned Stassi to ask what the jerk Frank thought of her & Stassi's father.

She's really pathetic. Thanks for sharing, /u/LabratSR. Yes!  ‘Below Deck’ for sure. *Damn!,* upon seeing Josiah in his gold costume.I hope they get the hose. Ha!  Certainly was. I still occasionally find myself wondering what kind of better explanation the bow-eater could've come up with. Stassi & James' mothers need to enter a *Maternal Rehab* program. The way she was laying her head on Stassi's shoulder & being all kissy in the restaurant made me immediately think that she was on something.  Something that was making her feel over-the-moon good inside at that moment. From what I've read & seen, this kind of 'mothering' is suppose to be typical with the Irish & is an old running joke in Ireland.  Now I'm wondering if this is particularly common in the U.S. South, or pretty evenly distributed throughout. Great submission, /u/floosyourteeth.  The conversation you got going is priceless.

Tamra sometimes reminds me of Tammy Bakker back when she was with husband Jim running the *PTL Club.* >*These OC housewives and their moral values 🤦🏻‍♀️*Which makes it all the more peculiar how some of them, like Tamra & Vicki, all but don banners declaring themselves 'Christians'. Wait, are they evangelicals? >*but if we do this without reigning in corporations*So true. >*This really seems like a season where they could bring back 3-4 crew next year realistically.*Yes it does.  This was a really, really good season. I felt bad for Caroline & Kate did step over the line in how she dealt with her in the end. I loved the captain's remark about how Rhylee needs to figure out that she's no longer working on a tugboat.  Pretty funny.  She keeps things interesting, that's for sure. I'm with your fiancé on this one.  Kate's the main reason I watch *Below Deck.*  I love to watch her operate.  She's so darn smart. >*What is Kroy's deal?*Thanks, /u/sneakykiki123, for asking the question that has most of us stumped. >*Plus, lentils are freakin delicious.*Oh, they truly *are.* It can be a confusing word, probably because people tend to put their own personal twists to it, since there are so many ways to choose to approach it. According to most definitions,   'a semi-vegetarian or flexitarian diet is one that is plant-based with the occasional inclusion of meat.'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-vegetarianism Except Bethenny was saying whatever she wanted to most long before she was surrounded by people she pays. ;) Don't know about her likability at this point, but I find her more interesting than ever. I still find Bethenny riveting. Maybe in a way we can't yet detect. We should try it & find out. Yes.  No matter how accurately it reflects how the culture operates, it perpetuates the idea that responsibility  lies solely with the victim.  Okay.  A former one. Or less.  Then he'll be replaced by the CEO of a pesticide company. Puerto Rico is also a global center for pharmaceutical manufacturing.  Hence, the concern about drug shortages in the U.S. following the hurricane. Here's a little introduction to a U.S government agency known as FEMA:   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_AgencyI can't imagine living in California just across the street from the latest wildfires & never having heard of it.  To no surprise, the Republicans have been trying to get rid of FEMA for years. He's talking about doing the same to California.  Do they pay taxes? Even better. >*There used to a front section.*Thanks.  Didn't realize that.For some reason, the idea of a shipwrecked oil rig has always held a particular fascination for me.  Its atmosphere is 'haunting' in a colder way. Better yet, use  industrial strength leaf blowers & make it another state's problem. A sick feeling is beginning to overwhelm me. A very pretty one. The Red Tide.  What  devastation.  Has it eased any? From article:>*Two years ago the lakes were almost full. But WaterNSW has been releasing water and allowing extraction upstream for irrigation at a rate that has left the lakes almost completely dry.*There's only  2.5% of water remaining in the lakes. Watch one episode of *Real Housewives of Orange County.*  No official data needed after that.   /s So true. Hoorah!  I'm feeling so darn proud.  Sort of like so many who see themselves as Christians are currently able to support Trump. Bragging that *trump is is better then Hillary because he chose the right (Russian) contacts and he won* is kind of convoluted. Maybe they aim to be safe than sorry. Apparently, there's a lot to get on with. Well, it's a duck. Thank you for taking the time to let me know, crouch.  And forbidden to mysteriously fall overboard, the latest past time on such cruises. Thank you for your help, David.  I think between our PMs that we've figured out it isn't my OS. **From the article:**  >*The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s program for listing species has long been underfunded and too slow. But under the Trump administration, progress has ground to a near halt.* >*The Endangered Species Act requires decisions about species protection to take two years, but on average it has taken the agency 12 years. To address a backlog of more than 500 species awaiting protection decisions, the Fish and Wildlife Service developed a seven-year workplan in late 2017. The Trump administration is now behind on decisions about lifesaving protections for 60 species.* >*“We want the Fish and Wildlife Service to be able to do its job and protect endangered species,” said Greenwald. “But under the Trump administration, all we’re getting are delays and wrongful denials of species badly in need of protection.”* Wow, I had no idea! One of Trump's recent tactics is to shut the govt down if he doesn't get money for the wall. Ha!  I think researchers decided that it wasn't a piece of the Atikythera mechanism, darn it. You went through all that & it didn't help?  That's awful. >*fracking was on the rise during both dem and rep leadership*Except the EPA wasn't used as a cheerleader for fracking while functioning under the Democrats, the party that wants to strengthen the agency rather than destroy it, as is the case under the current leadership. Republicans are proud of their motto:  *Whatever it takes to win* Nothing quite like the Republican politicians' squeals of delight as they plow through their fields of topsy-turvy hilarity. Like angels watching over us, it is.  >"the ability to alter video resolution"As in, to see or not to see.  Thanks for the extra details, archmedeznutz.  I was going by Defense Secretary James Mattis' general statement on the matter. Off the top of my head, vegan clothing can replace real fur,  feathers, silk,  wool, & felted pieces in general,   Personally, I think its largest impact is in shoes.Stella McCartney is a leading light in high-end vegan fashions. I'm so scared. But the border is to be run by the U.S. Border Patrol, which works under Dept of Homeland Security.  From what I've read, the U.S. troops have no authority to take any action & are literally there just 'to be there' for 'moral support'. It seems downright wasteful & silly. Word from the Pentagon is that those 5,000 troops could be used much more wisely  digging fire ditches as the wildfires rage in California.  They are actually needed there during this massive natural disaster.As it is, all they are 'officially' at the border for as is a 'confidence builder'.  They are to do nothing. The big question.  >*while the poor people abandon their home and never return* As in the gentrification of New Orleans in the wake of Katrina. Yes, it's over 2,000 years old. Good for you!  These women should've complained that the mens' calves were distracting & requested they be covered.  This article carries some valuable lessons on what *not* to do:  https://www.texastribune.org/2018/11/07/dallas-county-republican-gerrymander-backfires-2018/ *Most*?   Let's hope not. Here's one of the latest updates:  https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/california-wildfires-live-update-latest-death-toll-victims-looting-camp-paradise-woolsey-fire-a8630976.html  The Romanov women did smuggle jewels sewn inside their corsets. This wasn't discovered until after they were executed & explained why the bullets seemed to be deflected at times.The more popular story concerning Marie Antoinette's jewels involve the box supposedly lost by her hairdresser, Leonard, during their futile journey to escape France.  His box of jewels tends to outshine the one that safely reached its destination.  >*When he goes down it will be so spectacular that people will be reeling for years at how they got duped.*Chances are great that few will ever see themselves as having been duped.   What's your biggest complaint about your insurance? With finely crushed pearls used as flour. I'm not sure if this is of any help, but this may provide a bit of history into  'the big plan' as of Jan 5: https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Trump-seeks-historic-expansion-of-offshore-12474886.phpWhen coastal states balked at the unbridled risky drilling off their  shores,  Trump  let only Florida off the hook.  https://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article194089814.htmlCitizens of other coastal states have no say  in his offshore drilling plans. >*I expected to hear this happened in the US*Same here.  It appears that the US has a healthcare system on a par with China's?  Entities charging her are likely unaware of  her existence... as a human being. Congrats!  Wish there were more of you.  ;) Sad, sad, sad. It's about time. It appears that the role of cook is the most fraught with danger in the Antarctic.  According to this article, https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xw9bg3/an-attempted-murder-at-a-research-station-shows-how-crimes-are-prosecuted-in-antarctica, —due to Antarctica’s isolation, if you commit a crime there, you’re basically imprisoned in the same place that you committed it.>*'After a crime is committed in Antarctica, scientists don’t suddenly become police officers. Per the Antarctic Treaty of 1959—which the US, the then-Soviet Union, and 51 other nations signed—a person who commits a crime in Antarctica is subject to the law enforcement policies of their home country.'*>*'In the 1950s, a staffer at Australia’s Mawson base was locked in a storage room for  months. The person had become so violent that he could only be approached by the base doctor.'*>*'In 1996 at McMurdo station, one cook attacked another with the claw end of a hammer, injuring the intended victim & another cook.  The FBI was flown in for the 1st time in the station’s history.'*>*'In 2009  a drunk station staff member got into a fist fight with the chief cook at    a research station operated by South Korea.'* You're right.  Hadn't thought of that. I look forward to reading more. Thanks for expressing what I was thinking. Basic decisions normally made under the Endangered Species Act have been abandoned by the Trump admin, which is actively trying to get rid of the entire ESA itself. >*According to a new analysis by the Center for Biological Diversity, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service failed to make protection decisions for 57 species or designate critical habitat for another 21 promised under a seven-year workplan developed by the agency in 2016.The agency is under the leadership of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.*>*“Zinke and other Trump officials are preventing the Fish and Wildlife Service from doing critical work to protect species from extinction,” said Noah Greenwald, the Center’s endangered species director. “The wolverine, lesser prairie chicken and Hermes copper butterfly are all species Trump and Zinke left high and dry.”*>*...the agency only managed to make 18 decisions in 2018, resulting in listing of only four species and proposed protection for only eight species. Another six species were denied protection, including one, the beaverpond marstonia, which had gone extinct waiting for protection.*  Right in time for mid-terms.  After which, he'll do something to negate any environmental positive from this. What a 'Godly' man. Have never seen anything like that.  Seems they've gone through a lot of trouble to ensure their deaths are as torturous as possible. Eddie had moved on to Hamburger Helper without the burger by then. >*I've always found it funny how Neanderthals are looked at as barely more than a chimp compared to modern humans.*And the word is *still* used as an insult. You have a bit of influence simply by making intelligent comments & engaging with others in discussions.I'd very much appreciate you weighing in with a couple of comments in this heavily downvoted post.  Will serve to remind others that not all hunters on reddit are jerks.  ;)https://www.reddit.com/r/nature/comments/9ondab/i_shot_a_whole_family_of_baboons_idaho_fish_game/ You should try watching someone eat pickled pigs' feet some time. Thank you again.MockingbirdRambler, would you mind asking your fellow hunters here on reddit to please stop brigading & down voting this article wherever they come across it?    All such action does is widen the gulf between those who hunt & those who don't.The brigading is silly, especially since the article makes it clear that regular hunters think that people like this guy make *all* hunters look bad. Thanks for offering further insight. If you don't mind, what do you, personally, think about his trophy hunting? The title wasn't meant to be taken that literally, Zoollio. Well, he probably would've been promoted in Texas or Louisiana.  He still will likely end up in a higher paying position.  That photo, alone, tells a true horror story. He resigned, so at least any screw up was quickly fixed.  Prions... like in Mad Cow disease. I saw it when it first aired & it didn't feel cool, cutting edge, or even stylish.  But, it was probably true to what she'd always wanted, which is more important in the end.  That's been my understanding, but maybe not in all countries. You're hired. Oh, heck. Maybe it's not what I saw, but what I *thought* I was going to see.Based on her apartment & how she dressed, I was expecting something more  subdued.   Never heard about that.  That's way out there scary. >*But I didn't realise that it was normal for it to be related solely to the mother.*Yes, this is quite a discovery. The Republicans have very openly hated the existence of FEMA for years.  All they have to do is make FEMA look bad, then sit back & watch the public heap blame & hatred on the agency. The head of FEMA used to always have a position in the President's cabinet until the last Bush, who kicked them out of the cabinet & even moved their official headquarters down the street, just to make sure they understood how low on the Republican totem pole they are.You don't want to be hit by a hurricane, or any natural disaster, during a period when Republicans are in control.  They underfund FEMA & would love nothing more than to completely dismantle it. I bet that your mother suspected a connection. Next, we'll find out that when the father hits puberty determines when his daughter will. Great!  I promise to return it if I remember that I have it.  ;) >*I used to wake up and avoid people I’d gone out with because I didn’t know what I’d done or said.*You must have lived in almost a constant state of anxiety.  Good for you for truly waking up. ;) >*I’ve been hating the Toms so much more than Jax*Had no idea this was possible, Lex.  Unfortunately, not sure how interesting the show would be if they  acted their ages.  ;) Schwartz remains a truer friend to Jax than to Katie.  And to think, at the time, I thought that they were in the wrong. I love that we're learning about such fascinating connections.   Hat?  That's a bathroom light fixture from the 1920s.  Only Sonja would be brave enough to wear it. Mind if I borrow your good memory, Queenie? Is it too personal to ask what age you were? I now have to wonder if  Heather & Terry Dubrow always knew the *real* David Beador.  The night they attacked him so viciously at that party, it seemed so out of left field that I felt bad for him at the time. But, you can't say it wasn't interesting.  Who can ever forget her special wedding dance? Though a big fan, I was shocked by the decor at Bethenny's wedding. She *is* more likable now.  Not that I ever found her completely unlikable before.  You beat me to it.  The atmosphere at Ramona's was saturated with desperation.  I've never understood the 'tears of tender happiness' from some of her cast mates in attendance.  The whole affair was almost as bad as that 'romantic' night with all the roses & Mario.  Plus the part straight out of the JC Penny catalogue. *'This stripy toe sock...'* It'd be interesting to see if I view the situation differently now on rewatching.  ;) Would Jill have made  up with Bethenny had LuAnne not been present? I hope so. A service run by an idiot in Orange County. I'm experiencing a total blackout on both of these subjects.  Can't wait to find out what happened. It was 70s, just not very good. Not like Brooks did. Didn't Caroline call Danielle the clown? So, *Goodfellas* is one of your favorites? Who? Nah.  Brandi was out to bring LVP down at that point. Very colorful but dull vitamins, many of which were nail enhancers. Kim was probably in ficial straits at the time & made a quick agreement, resulting in 'seller's remorse' later.  The answer doesn't matter.  *She's trying to kill me!* I figured it wouldn't go over, but gave it a shot anyway.  I think that it speaks very basically & loudly about, perhaps, unintended pitfalls when one culture enters another's as a visitor. Like those in the plastic bottles from which we drink water. Yes, & it probably also has to do with the additives sneaked into our foods even while we try & 'eat healthy'.  It was almost impossible not to like Kristen, but I'd  never want her, Heather, or Jules back. >*pharmacies who don't have such limitations*Apologies, but could you explain what you mean by *'such limitations'*? And, maybe, environmental pollution? In some states, the government is coming down hard on independent pharmacists, while allowing huge industrial pharmacies like CVS to run rampant over customers.It's almost like the government is in cahoots with Big Pharma to put the Mom & Pops out of business. And if your  insurance company forces you to use such pharmacies? Yes! Ha!  Apparently so.  Hi deltaroo.  With apologies, I ask that you please resend it? Looks like he was trying to have it both ways. Sounds good to me, although, I've no problem with infrastructure.  What do you mean, exactly, when you urge, *'Vote green!'*? Just in time for the midterms, the House has a bill ready to fully fund the border wall.   It doesn't help much if you have a septic tank & your neighbors don't. Or, if the infrastructure can't handle the sewage. Thanks for letting me know! Fascinating.  Can't wait to learn the reasons behind it.  Sounds like fumes. I believe you!  ;)I think that one of the points being made is that animals we don't necessarily imbue with qualities, such as dogs' emotional intelligence,  are just as special. There's a big push for Democrats to run on gun control.  Anyone else see a big problem with this? Let's see.  First Trump forces states to accept drilling near their coastlines, then removes rules that'd keep these states from being devastated by offshore industrial accidents.  That'll teach states not to fall in line with his wishes. >**'Is there a guideline or goverce principle that FEMA has to follow in terms of how long this type of support can be provided?'**>*FEMA can provide housing assistance for up to 18 months from the date of the disaster, unless extended.*  From the US Dept of Homeland Securityhttps://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1915-25045-1910/20130510_fact_sheet_temporary_housing_assistance.pdf >*FEMA can provide housing assistance for up to 18 months from the date of the disaster, unless extended.***From the US Dept of Homeland Security**https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1915-25045-1910/20130510_fact_sheet_temporary_housing_assistance.pdf I don't see anyone complaining here about all the people still displaced by Hurricane Harvey in Texas & Louisiana.  Hi Bert, The problem is,  they aren't following correct procedure at this point. There are entire towns in some Gulf states that still haven't recovered from a hurricane that hit a decade ago.  But let's crucify this mother & her children for not doing so within a year?   And getting more expensive by the day.  Generics were suppose to be the answer to avoiding high drug prices, but companies like CVS have done all they can to keep the price of generics rising. And where are her children to stay while she's off working at this 'job' of which you speak? What do you suggest mothers do in order not to wind up in the streets with their children under these circumstances? Yeah, his background looks solid, which makes one wonder about these accusations. More on the situation:  https://www.chron.com/news/article/Judge-rejects-effort-to-temporarily-halt-killing-13230373.php Thank you, /u/WeKilledSocrates. That's fascinating.  Thanks!  But, also very curious is this:  *'Historically, the phenomenon is particularly associated with Germany, which produced many reported instances.'* Or paying attention. And not even sure if it was the 'guilty' one. True, but this could've been an entanglement that happened naturally.  (Hope so!)   Hi Birda.  I feel obligated to 'reply' in some way.  ;)https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/17/trumps-wildlife-board-claims-trophy-hunting-saves-endangered-animals Maybe some kind soul can find one.  >*misappropriation is probably the “root” of a lot of issues*One would think they could make the money 'talk' a lot better to the host countries.  Perhaps trophy hunting & tourism organizations should try a lot harder when it comes to deterring the misappropriation of funds.  Surely there are mechanisms that can be put in place to help prevent this. >*Remember when we went 8 years without the president grabbing anyone by the pussy, or paying a porn star for sex or nominating sex offenders for government positions, or campaigning for child molesters all while being the darling of the evangelical church? When the president was on his first marrage and the First Lady was the nice lady who grew vegetables on the whitehouse lawn and was the mother of all the presidents children?*The 'Family Values' Republican Party has tried its best to make sure that having any shred of moral fiber is no longer expected of a U.S. President or themselves.  **Trophy Hunting Fees Do Little to Help Threatened Species**>https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/14/us/politics/trophy-hunting-fees-do-little-to-help-threatened-species-report-says.html>https://www.cnn.com/2015/05/19/opinions/trophy-hunting-not-conservation-flocken/index.html>https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/11/elephant-trophy-hunting-psychology-emotions/546293/>http://fortune.com/2016/06/14/trophy-hunting-fees/ The link still works for me.  Sorry you're having a problem. This is going to be a big shock to those living in the comment section. Please check the auto mod removal process.  There's a problem. Yeah, as usual, Trump & too many conservatives don't believe her & are calling it part of a big conspiracy. Original article:  https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-drug-spread-pricing/?utm_source=whatsapp&utm_medium=msg&utm_campaign=whatsapp Ha!  Good response. When you said, 'family connections', I was picturing a friend of a friend of one your distant cousins. I still haven't seen that movie too many times. And a cigarette at the end of a beautiful long holder as an accessory.  ;) Ever experienced the 'before', 'during', or aftermath of a hurricane?  Few things can  remind you of what nature can do better than a hurricane, even one of low category.  As a genius, he knows that the child is much more an immediate danger than the hurricane.  He's afraid.  He's very afraid. I'm surrounded by people still saying that if he wasn't smart, he wouldn't be a 'billionaire' & President. Even assuming that he is aware of what he's doing, he wouldn't care. Not sure *how,* but that does gradually happen, & to a surprising degree. Jason's $30 burger. That house is beyond description.  That massage in that house was really creepy!   Well, even in the first season, when I think she was 12(?), Avery was better grounded than Ramona.  I marveled that Avery managed to carry on in the face of Ramona's many embarrassing moments. For *sure,*  Avery had a better fashion sense than her mother, who would've been wiser to have followed her daughter's suggestions. Their relationship in S2 is positively captivating.  I couldn't wait to see what was going to go down between them next. Bethenny wasn't focused so much on herself & served more as an interpreter, translating Jill's personality into something very audience friendly.   She injected a great sense of humor into the whole show by being more objective, even when in the middle of the worst scrapes. I've never been able to figure out why Alex or Simon didn't stop him.  It made no sense. Yeah.  I found Alex & Simon's relationship particularly interesting.  I've not seen another like it on the franchise. >*Stop obsessing with how personally green you live – and start collectively taking on corporate power*Yes!  Finally. Yes, & this study found health benefits:  "This study showed that mice who ate one meal per day, and thus had the longest fasting period, seemed to have a longer lifespan and better outcomes for common age-related liver disease and metabolic disorders."I think the researcher in the other quote was pointing out how difficult it's been for the scientific community as a whole in this area of study to reach a conclusion on which they all agree. How has it changed your life? It's based on a new study involving mice.  A researcher sums things up by saying, "'So far, the consensus seems to be ‘let’s wait until more rigorous studies, with larger sample sizes that adjust for confounding lifestyle behaviors, have been performed before we conclude anything prematurely.'" Yes, it does. >*I'd like to think (or dream) that the Democratic candidates aren't stupid enough not to pick it up.*It should be their platform. There *is* hope. >*From 1972 to 1995, Congress housed the Office of Technological Assessment, where a staff of more than 140 technologists advised members on the latest technological issues. When Republicans took Congress in 1995, they eliminated the office. Despite frequent calls for its return, largely from Democrats, Republicans continue to block it.*>*“People who could have advised Congress on things like cybersecurity or net neutrality or online infiltration of ad networks or whatever it may happen to be haven’t existed for 23 years, and this was done on purpose,” Schuman says. “They are dumb by design.”* What do you think should be the starting point? Uh, you sure about that? That'd be a start. For Republicans, it's pretty much been a massive success. True.  It's not to the Congressional majority's benefit.  But, this does show that they're way past even bothering to pretend. I know.  Something seems 'off' about this story. Hi EllegantAnt.  Of course there are women who prefer no pockets.  But, I don't think that preference represents decades & decades of the majority. Yeah, what happened to that? That's a myth straight out of the fashion industry. From what I can find, humans do not appear to be susceptible to the African swine fever virus. Yeah, he's that quiet kind of hero one can really admire. After all, it's the only way to make a fair & balanced decision on the subject.  /s It's *always* their approach & it *always* works so well.  /s Because, it's to our benefit to know what he's up to? >*FEMA got the supplies there.*Dumped them & left them on the piers.  The local govt had no means of transporting & dispensing them.  Blame can be found on both sides, but claiming Trump did everything he could & was suppose to do is simply not true.  Trump did well after Harvey, but over 5 days drifted by before he even started paying attention to Puerto Rico.  He was busy bashing some pro-footballers at the time. Could this explain his recent meltdown? Probably 98%. /s Thank you for your hard work, Sara.What are the chances of recovery of any species under Republican politicians in Louisiana?  Do you think they're serious about trying to save what's left of the Louisiana coast? I'm looking forward to the new *Up & Vanished.* It didn't bother me, but I did find the baby-talk curious. Apparently, that's of no concern to Republican politicians in Texas. Except, this haul included 14 of the 50 most endangered turtle species in the world.  I'm assuming that what they're doing isn't good for the endangered ones. The moron *& his political party.* Really. Where I'm at, the big message would be:  *'We Don't Want Your Guns'.* Different ways,  including ships expelling ballast water from their systems.Plus, some states (like Florida) have a history of lax invasive species regulations, allowing foreign plants & animals to spread into other states. I've wondered about that, myself. Also, since there are only 2 species of coelacanth & both are threatened, it's the most endangered order of animals in the world.  Didn't realize that. Turns out longer ago than that... 1938 off South Africa.  It hasn't been that long ago that we discovered coelacanths still exists. Agree.  But, 'raw'?  Let's be honest, it's 'feral'. This is a good thing. You're likely right. Thanks, birda.  That's a well-written, thoughtful article. I see your point, birda, but I doubt the writer of the article chose the photo or illustration to accompany it.  That was most likely done by an editor.I grew up with hunters.  I live around hunters.  I have family & friends who are hunters.  I don't hate hunters. I can't.  Perhaps you should be more concerned about how this administration & the NRA are making hunters look. Are you making fun of the dead animal, or just people who may be moved by its death at the hands of this proud hunter?  He represents the Trump crowd. Hmm.  Good question. >*I think a lot of people see the word "logging" and think we want to just go in and raze swaths of land Viking-style. That's disingenuous, and frankly intellectually dishonest.*You're the one insinuating that this 'other way' doesn't exist. >*I think a lot of people see the word "logging" and think we want to just go in and raze swaths of land Viking-style. That's disingenuous, and frankly intellectually dishonest.*'Disingenuous' & 'intellectually dishonest'?  Bullshit.  It's exactly the kind of logging that's happening all around me. >*but I felt disappointed at the bend over backwards bipartisanship that happened when we had control of the Senate.*That was a frustrating time.  Some wanted to shout, "Stop being so *nice*!"  The Republicans' reason for existing was to try & block every move made by the Democrats. And the seas can't rise if we get rid of the water. Oh  yeah.  Wasn't a whole neighborhood flooded when they had to release water from behind a levee in the aftermath of Harvey? ;) I'm looking forward to no one having calmed down. LeeAnne must've been behaving herself. Why are the Housewives still stumbling around in last season's heels?  Or is it just the ones in Dallas? Rather than an 'apocalyptic' article, I see this as scientists cautioning that changes need to be made in how dams & reservoirs are handled worldwide.  Seems pretty straightforward.   Cornflower blue tastes best to me. And fewer underwater explosions detonated by the military & the fossil fuel exploration industry.  Thanks, thurmco.For the record, some pathetic soul is going through & down voting every comment in this submission.  Hence, you should be at 1 or less any moment now. ;) Yeah, who would've thought! So glad to see attention being brought to this. I hope that next time she has a healthy baby.  ;)It'd be so interesting to know what went wrong with this calf, but it doesn't sound like the scientists are going to get to find out. It sounds like their building codes are a mess that favor the developers, of course. I need to look into this whole thing. Probably.  ;) True.  Tori certainly doesn't have a problem being herself in front of the camera. >*I'm kind of excited. When you watch Tori on her own shows, she can control the narrative more or less.  Put her down with the BH women and we'll see what happens.*Good point!  This could be really interesting. I like the idea of Tori joining the cast.  After all, her father once owned that town. This could be good. Ha! Opioids!!!  *'Get a rope.'* Except she did win the popular vote. Thanks, letawook. There are no words. With Trump's grandstanding & the Republican Party's encouragement, the hate & insanity grow. I mainly recall Tom Sandoval's amazing ability to have every imaginable piece of clothing & accessory  at hand for every man present, especially the triplets. That takes talent! Yeah, that was a sweet moment. She does seem to be blaming veganism for still being alive.  ;P Huh.  Interesting.  I hope that someone else will add to this. That'd leave scuttling it, thinking they'd return some day for all the gold.  But it seems, historically, there's usually always a last ditch scramble to hide it for later. >*Why the hell would the crew not take the hypothetical gold with them at that point?*Was wondering the same thing. I had no idea.  How disappointing. The backstabbing between her assistants *made* that show. So am I. I still wonder what became of them all.  *Very* interesting show!  I loved watching the cutthroat competition to get anywhere at all in the art world culture of NYC.  Her previous public persona was shot after that. That show was so bizarre that, in the end, I had to force myself not to watch it. Yes!  I *still* miss that show.  Was so disappointed when Bravo dropped it. Is *Ladies of London* never returning?  It was one of my favorites. Nevertheless, I always find these finds fascinating for some reason. Great headline. I don't know.  I barely have access, yet I, too, should've been asleep hours ago. ;) This is what's been overturned:  http://www.takepart.com/article/2014/07/31/us-bans-gmos-bee-killing-pesticides-national-wildlife-refuges/>*U.S. Bans GMOs, Bee-Killing Pesticides in All Wildlife Refuges - The Fish & Wildlife Service will phase out genetically engineered crops & neonicotinoids by 2016.*  And that's it. There has to be a catch. Yes, sounds like it's something everyone should force themselves to do for the good of their health.  ;) ;) Thank you. >*So you just wanna trade links all day?*No.  I'll let you have the last say through a link. ;) >*Trophy hunting—the killing of big game for a set of horns or tusks, a skin, or a taxidermied body—has burgeoned into a billion-dollar, profit-driven industry, overseen in some cases by corrupt governments.*https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/10/trophy-hunting-killing-saving-animals/ >*How Trump’s wildlife board is rebranding trophy hunting as good for animals*https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/17/trumps-wildlife-board-claims-trophy-hunting-saves-endangered-animals Sure about that?

Not only can they not change, they want to go backwards. I doubt that a lot of his supporters will ever know that he said it.  And, those that do, will think he's being clever or simply believe it. Poor thing.  She'll have to turn to pills for a year. Dorinda has the best wardrobe of them all.   Or Sophia Loren in 1962. One of my favorite podcasts ever. >*break out their Uggs and heavy winter clothes when it dips down into the 60s.*Then they're full of regret as the temperature edges up to the low 90s by noon. Are you sure that you want to get rid of Ashley?  She makes a great villain. Every show needs one. It helps to be a bit manic. ;) And has one of the *Below Deck* crews running the yacht. Ha!  The kind of mistake I'd make. Gizmo & Craig were a show in themselves. You can identify with Craig?  Then you must have a very lovable side to you.  ;) With the US Corp of Engineers in charge of the levees, why bother?  They do what the govt tells them to do, not what science dictates. That's odd.  I didn't type the title.   Just checked & *Smithsonianmag* has corrected it   now.  Except, Trump & his supporters are all about 'living for today'.   I had no idea it was this bad. Yeah, I don't usually pay much attention to the 'last uncontacted tribe' articles.  But this one seems a bit different, as it involves one man that has been  studied from afar by anthropologists for quite a few years. That was news to me, too.  I guess the religious right know some dark secrets we're not privy to.  You seem to know a lot about pirates.  Have you, perchance, studied much about Jean Lafitte? Love that scene!  It's so off-the-wall weird. Yes! Denise Richards would be a wonderful addition to RHBH.You're right, she was great in *Drop Dead Gorgeous,* an underrated comedy/*movie*  if ever there was one.  Heck, *everyone* was outstanding in it.  To this day, I never watch it without laughing throughout. Denise was the perfect mean girl. If you're a Republican, you turn on FEMA with a vengeance when it's unable to render enough aid in the next disaster. Well, if a speedy death is all that counts... ;)>*Alcohol is the deadliest drug of all. Let’s look at why this is true.*https://www.addictioncenter.com/community/why-alcohol-is-the-deadliest-drug/ Congrats.  But, cannabis doesn't work for everyone. Why isn't the government declaring an *'Alcohol Epidemic'* & raiding liquor stores & breweries in the same way it's declared an *'Opioid Epidemic'* & is raiding doctors' offices & pharmacies? /s Oh, now, fungussa, FEMA shouldn't deny *anyone* help following a disaster.   Yes, but her sense of humor is on the dry side. No, another Republican president. Kanye, now,  would blame the people for not swimming out of there fast enough. Under the Republicans, their job is to dismantle & do away with FEMA.  They've been trying for years.  They cut its budget last year & admitted they were unprepared for the season ahead.Americans are suppose to wind up blaming FEMA for all its shortcomings, according to the Republican playbook.  Great.  Last year FEMA admitted that it wasn't prepared.  This year, it's not even going to try.This is FEMA under Republican rule.  Their goal is to destroy it. Is Australia tracing the sewage directly to the 'guilty' flushers in order to arrest them yet? Thanks,  /u/elinordash. They, apparently, never watched any James Bond movies. Yeah, I did a double-take on that one too. Chances are great that, like Trump, he likes asbestos too.  ;) It's almost like we exist to aid the corporations. Ha!  Yeah, until you mentioned it, I'd forgotten about the velcro incident.I'll be thinking, 'Craig is such a wonderfully unique individual', then I remember how he lied for so long, especially to Naomi.  Still, he's so likable that I hope to  understand that some day. Let's not forget, he's being backed by the Republican Party. And, 'national security'.  On the contrary, I think that Craig being male & passionate about sewing pillows makes him & his product stand out.  I don't think people would pay all that much attention if, say, Chelsea or Danni were making them. And, the grief Craig gets over his pillow making works very much in his favor. I agree with /u/morrowgirl, however, in that any success will depend on Craig actually sticking with it & seeing it through. Not exactly his nature. Jane Goodall is a 'retard'? Thanks!  Good to know that the scripted programs won't be taking over. Sorry you're being down voted.  It's happening to some of us in this post today.   The greatest down votes  usually come when the topic involves hunting as a sport.

But if forced to choose, artificial safari hunts would be banned.  Yes, there are trophy hunting farms in Texas.  They're raised like pets, have no fear whatsoever of humans.  Then set lose on some leased land for some banker from NYC to kill with the instrument of his choice. >*He's going to have a distraction.*A big one.  Bigger than usual.  The very essence of his ego is on the line. >it's been extremely entertaining since episode 1.*And I've been hooked since episode 1.  Talk about surprised... How does Bravo have them ranked?

Prepare for a tantrum. >*a bit controversial*You're good with the understatement.  Hi birda13, you might find this article interesting:   https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/hunting-big-game-why-people-kill-animals-for-fun/ Some disagree:   https://www.cnn.com/2015/05/19/opinions/trophy-hunting-not-conservation-flocken/index.html>*for the most part hunters are those most tuned in and most concerned with the well being of these animals and the wilderness thry live in. They are part of that ecosystem.*I have plenty of family & friends who are hunters & they do see themselves as environmentalists. And, I do understand their point of view. This article pretty much looks at both sides:  https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/10/trophy-hunting-killing-saving-animals/ Opinions vary:  https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/14/us/politics/trophy-hunting-fees-do-little-to-help-threatened-species-report-says.html The words 'ranchers' & 'hunters' are more seductive to politicians than 'environmental scientists'.   Her pain was so extreme following the riding accident that any pills she took to dull the physical trauma more than likely served to extend her life rather than shorten it.  Her pain appeared unbearable. My breath caught when I realized why I was seeing her photograph in the news tonight.  She was  uniquely intriguing.   Though they claimed to be champions of ranchers, the Bundys’ allies were mostly armed members of fringe militias who vehemently oppose the federal govt.  There were only 2 actual ranchers in the standoff.  The  pardon from the most powerful office in the world, raises them up like the victims of an insidious system.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundy_standoffhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Malheur_National_Wildlife_Refuge >*but never got bit or felt threatened really*It's odd how non-threatening they appear to be compared to spiders that can cause immediate shudders upon first sight, but are relatively harmless.   As you said.  ;) Yes, but the higher priced mock meat serves as a fine gateway to vegetarianism &  veganism  for some. If at all possible, it should be. These are no less than wonderful.  Fine novelty gifts. 'Nursing homes' & 'retirement centers' can sometimes be  little more  trash bins for the unwanted.   Good to hear. Dani revealed, at that moment, that she possesses true class, unlike T-Rav. I think Thomas convinced Katherine that he desperately wanted children by her, leading her to believe that they'd all be together forever.  Apparently, this is his favorite standard line, since he's led Ashley to believe the same thing.  But, Ashley's older & more experienced than Katherine, hence no T-Rav babies yet. Conveys her inward strength. A 'single dad' after trying his best through power & money to marginalize their mother. Naomi & Chelsea especially stand out this season.  And there's nothing not to like about Danni, now that we're getting to know her better. >*Pruitt is the only confirmed appointee that Trump can simply slide into that role without needing another congressional confirmation.*Oh no, I didn't realize that. Pruitt's trying to please his political party & quickly destroy the EPA in case he's removed from office & replaced by another Republican who demolishes the agency even quicker, showing him up.  Sorry to hear that. Traditionally, Republican politicians are anti-FEMA & do what they can to make sure the agency doesn't work properly. The fault of how it's being grown.  The plant, itself, is not at fault, of course. >*I find it toxically ironic that the party of small government has decided to literally choose denial as a policy strategy- because that simple policy - is going to bring about the world of their greatest fears much faster that anyone could predict.*This evangelically driven party very much wants to drive us to the ultimate end.  They're tired of waiting. But, what about Mar-a-Lago?  How will it become a national monument for future generations to tour if it's under water? *Any* medical care in rural areas is disappearing.  The new wave has topped & overtaken by the old wave. How, humanpredator? From the article:>*Wildlife groups aren’t happy with the contest.*  **A group of scientists at the Atlanta Coyote Project**  *calls the contest “both inhumane and unwise,” citing the fact that several studies have called into question the idea that killing coyotes is even effective.* I understand your concern.  Didn't they become kind of super predators after so many of the wolves were killed out? Your loved ones have been attacked by coyotes? I agree.  This response to the 'epidemic' will be a boon for the alcohol industry.>*While I think medical or legalized marijuana will help with the opioid crisis...*Seems the last hard push to legalize marijuana, which I hope finally happens, came about the same time that the use of opioids 'officially' became an epidemic in the US. Yet, the alcohol continues to flow unabated.  As it should. >*BTW, I have chronic pain and I know how hard it is to get pain relief.

If you're taking 3g / week and talking about not being able to feel happiness without it I would re-evaluate your stance on whether you are addicted.

It's prob posted here already but there was that US congressman who seemed to think just that![https://youtu.be/cesSRfXqS1Q](https://youtu.be/cesSRfXqS1Q) I don't think phenibut is for everyone. Anyone actively looking for a recreational high is going to be disappointed and risk taking dangerous doses. I think it shines best in people prone to anxiety as it is an anxiolytic.I don't eat breakfast. I take 600-900mg phenibut at 8am. By 10am I begin feeling it at which time I take 100mg of caffeine. Normally caffeine makes me very anxious and jittery, but on phenibut I don't get any of that. The caffeine and phenibut synergize completely by 11:00-11:30am and this is when I get the bulk of my days work done.I feel like that's an overlooked factor. In order to feel the benefits of it you have to be doing something work related or something that is taxing mentally. While I'm working I can focus better, I find myself smiling at small accomplishments in my work, and nodding to music more freely. I feel positive about being able to get through my work load and an elevated sense of energy. I'm more talkative with my co-workers and more willing to communicate.When I work out I can run further, faster, lift heavier, and more reps. I'm more willing to get into it. https://media.giphy.com/media/Aff4ryYiacUO4/giphy.gif This reminds me of 10 years ago when I was still pretty inexperienced and tripped with my friend on shrooms- his first time.We at epiphany after epiphany through out the night and at one point decided to write it all down on a pizza box.When we came to we decided to reflect on our profound pizza box discoveries, but we found that there was only a single letter written down: "G". I have no idea what it meant... drugs are weird. Heard on the police scanner that it looks to be a blown transformer on Fairview & Thomas. Accidentally posted on a throwaway revealing my secret alter ego.And now I must kill you. That's how age is counted in Korean culture. /r/boop I guess I just have a terrible nose. Ya it's definitely one of those pear trees. Maybe the pink one is a different tree- they were in a row. I walk by it every day- going to take a closer look.Thanks. He does describe it as semen... ugh looking back into it now.Edit: [Callery Pear tree](https://www.theawl.com/2013/04/your-street-probably-smells-like-semen-right-now-but-it-might-not-next-spring/) It's located in Seattle, WA USA.I found a link on a government website that does say there are Stella Cherry trees in the city.I'm pretty much asking because according to my friend- they smell very bad and pungent, but to me they hardly smell at all or very faintly but definitely not stinky in the way he is describing. Certainly. In the world of psychedelics, psychonauts often quote the philosopher Alan Watts, "when you get the message, hang up."Everything in moderation and one could benefit a lot from cycling their vices and habits. Discomfort is often the impetus to growth.----For me personally, I've been smoking for over 10 years. It's definitely had positive effects on my life as well as negative. Currently on a 2 month break possibly until the end of the year to focus on health and personal growth. I think knowing the outcome, sure. But I'd imagine it'd be nearly impossible to process the shock of getting shot while resisting the temptation to get up and run or do something.Imagine if he did play dead then was shot anyways, then obviously what he tried to do was the right move. In this type of situation outcome bias doesn't mean much because it could have easily gone either way. I absolutely loathe this line of logic that gets recited so often. The idea that all the people in the world who defend MJ do it because they like his music.It is such a ridiculously absurd idea in the context of an allegation as serious as child sexual abuse.As Dave Chapelle said, "I was around for Thriller, and I only kinda want to meet the guy. I wouldn't break an appointment, I'll say that."Nobody is wasting their time defending him because of his music. They are defending him because there is a legitimate case to be made for his innocence. We are talking in the court of public opinion, because he has been found overwhelming innocent in the court of law.The issue with MJ's case is that it is so complex in terms of wealth of information that it is very time consuming for any person to become knowledgeable on the topic. At a cursory glance I can see how it looks bad. People think 1 accuser against a famous person, fine- but 2,3,4,5- oh, he's guilty.If you look into each accuser, every single accusation falls apart under scrutiny. There is also a ton of tabloid misinformation that gets recited constantly. A few examples would be: Jordan Chandler's description matched, they found child porn at Neverland, the estate has an obvious ficial motive. Jordan's description included MJ being circumcised, but his autopsy revealed he wasn't. Think about the idea of finding child porn at Neverland- that would have put him in jail! That would have been a smoking gun if true. Lastly, the estate goes to the children- the neices, nephews, brothers, and sisters of MJ don't get anything from the estate. On the other hand Safechuck and Robson are in an appeal for a 1.5B lawsuit. Billion not million. Also, Safechuck filed his lawsuit 2 days after his family's business was sued for almost a million. Robson joined in suit immediately after being turned down for a role at MJ's cirque du soleil.If you really spend the time to dig into the facts there aren't just a few, but dozens of critical holes in all of the accusations against MJ. Again, if there were a shred of evidence the trials wouldn't have been a landslide victory for MJ. Also, keep in mind MJ dealt with tons of frivolous law suits. The maid that often gets cited here only made her accusations after being terminated and losing a wrongful termination case. MJ countersued for theft and won.I honestly would not be bothered if I never heard another MJ song again. It has nothing to do with his music. It has to do with being absolutely sure someone is guilty before accusing them of a life, career, and legacy ending accusation. > Stewart says that Toon “fed the press a story in which, as a consequence of an evening spent orally servicing a gang of sailors in a gay bar in San Diego, I had been required to check into a hospital emergency room to have my stomach pumped.”Uhhhh I literally just got home from watching this movie and need to process it a bit more, but here are some thoughts:On a surface level I enjoyed the thriller aspects of it, but the more I thought about it the less I liked it.I felt like it had overtones of manifest destiny and, for a lack of a better term, Americans being assholes. The doppelgangers are the Americans. The doppelgangers were inarticulate, mindless killers. Americans are stereotypically dumb, and subscribe to nationalism and globalism- taking over by force.When young Adelaide walks into the hall of mirrors I'm pretty sure there was a native american shaman on top. Americans took their land from the aboriginal native Americans through blood.I thought the symbolism of the hands across America just represented taking over the country, often by killing.Doppelgangers often represent impending doom. Abraham is obviously a prominent figure in religion, and is promised land and children by God. Pluto in Greek mythology was the ruler of the underworld.I'll flesh out some more ideas in my sleep. Sure, but in any case with regards to nitrous(laughing gas), it comes from misinformation. Nitrous killing brain cells is an urban myth, and could only be caused by a lack of oxygen to the brain which nitrous itself does not cause. If it were dangerous they wouldn't still be using it. As far as drugs go it is one of the most safest, especially when considering mixing various drugs. Alcohol for example is dangerous with most other drugs, where nitrous is safe with nearly every other drug.[dancesafe article](https://dancesafe.org/no-nitrous-does-not-deprive-your-brain-of-oxygen/)article references [this journal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2614651/)> It is often believed that the effects of nitrous, which include euphoria, sound distortion, and minor to strong hallucinations, is caused by oxygen deprivation to the brain. This is a common misconception.> Review of scientific literature on the effects of nitrous oxide shows no evidence that the gas decreases oxygen flow to the brain, nor that it kills brain cells. Marijuana can both help alleviate and cause anxiety. Typically lower doses of THC reduces anxiety, and higher THC levels increase anxiety. CBD decreases anxiety.THC increases your heart rate by 20-50BPM and shares a lot of symptoms of an anxiety/panic attack.Once you have an anxiety/panic attack you are more likely to have another- partly in due to the fear of thinking you might have one, actually causing you to have one.I would suggest lower THC strains with CBD, or stop altogether if it is no longer enjoyable.[link](https://www.verywellmind.com/marijuana-and-anxiety-1393132)> ...repeated use doesn't seem to lead to any long-term reduction of symptoms and in some individuals may increase depression over time.> THC can raise your heart rate, which, if you have anxiety, may make you feel even more anxious. Using too much marijuana can also make you feel scared or paranoid.> In some cases, marijuana can also induce orthostatic hypotension, a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing, which can cause lightheadedness or feeling faint. Cannabis can also cause feelings of dizziness, nausea, confusion, and blurred vision, which can contribute to anxiety. Contrary to popular belief- driving impaired, including under the influence of marijuana, increases the likelihood of a crash.Don't drive impaired- it's not just for your own safety but for that of the other drivers on the road. Driving is a privilege- you are driving a metal death machine. You are experiencing auditory hallucinations, so yes- your paranoia is that bad and by your own account it is affecting your driving. Marijuana can have paradoxical effects based on the person.Being high increases your heart rate by 20-50 BPM by lowering your blood pressure, can increase anxiousness, heighten senses, and increase perspiration- all of which are shared symptoms with an anxiety/panic attack.If you are prone to anxiety attacks your body could be confusing the symptoms of being high with that of an attack.It is very likely that you have an underlying anxiety condition that is being exacerbated by cannabis. If you do wish you continue, I would try smoking CBD with thc which can mitigate the symptoms. Long term I would familiarize yourself with tools used in [cognitive behavioral therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy). Yeah, I was going to mention specifically cardio I get a huge boost in performance.Pretty interesting stuff- I didn't know it was banned in the Olympics. I haven't looked into the exact mechanisms behind it, but I find on the days I work out *after* phenibut my workouts go much better.It could be placebo or just a byproduct of feeling good, but it has a definite effect on me.I hadn't considered using a workout as a means to potentiate phenibut though. I'm pretty afraid of heights and that was the first hike I did. Pretty terrifying even though I saw little kids doing it no problem(little shits). I've been taking phenibut for the past 8-10 weeks. I started at 300mg, then 600mg->900mg the highest I've tried is 1.5g in 2 doses over several hours.I take it Monday and Thursday. I take 1 week off every 3 weeks.I'm also prone to anxiety and this is what I've learned for me:-900mg gives me zero negative side effects, and makes Monday's/work go by a lot smoother.-Over 1G feels recreational to me and no longer just therapeutic. There are waves early on where I am noticeably euphoric.-At 1.5g I experience definite negative side effects. Brain fog the days after, elevated anxiety, and night terrors.-Being anxiety prone makes it slightly more difficult to stay disciplined with phenibut. You'll be tempted to take it more often, and in higher quantity. Don't.-I find it helps to take phenibut when you have to do something otherwise sometimes the effects can go rather unnoticed. e.g. work.I recommend doing what I did, and find the exact dosage that you consider 'therapeutic' and stick to it with the occasional recreational dose if you really want to. "Your mere presence and sympathy is likely enough." reminds me of this:Gender perspective : [http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/34aqsn/women_of_reddit_what_about_men_baffles_you_the/cqsxgvl](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/34aqsn/women_of_reddit_what_about_men_baffles_you_the/cqsxgvl)>My perspective may not be the popular one, but I think this generalization stems from different priorities and methods of communication. Here's an example:>>**MAN 1:** I am experiencing an emotion.>>**MAN 2:** What is the cause of this emotion?>>**MAN 1:** The cause is a problem that I am having.>>**MAN 2:** Perhaps you should solve the problem.>>**MAN 1:** I lack a method by which to solve the problem.>>**MAN 2:** I shall lend my assistance in devising a solution.>On the opposite side of the gender fence, we have this:>>**WOMAN 1:** I am experiencing an emotion.>>**WOMAN 2:** Please describe the complexity of this emotion.>>**WOMAN 1:** The emotion is very complex.>>**WOMAN 2:** I can sympathize with that emotion, and with its complexity.>>**WOMAN 1:** I appreciate your sympathy, and would value a chance to further explore this emotion.>>**WOMAN 2:** I shall acquire spelunking gear, that we might probe its very depths.>In short, men tend to be solution-driven. We're just as emotional and sensitive, but we're often more focused on the cause of our emotions rather than the emotions themselves. This gives us the appearance of being shallow, but from a masculine perspective, it feels more akin to being efficient. Following that, some men become irritated when it seems like they're being presented with a problem to fix, but all their female partners really want is someone to listen and understand.>A good way of remedying this would be as follows:>>**WOMAN:** I am experiencing an emotion.>>**MAN:** What is the cause of this emotion?>>**WOMAN:** The cause is a problem that I am having.>>**MAN:** Perhaps you should solve the problem.>>**WOMAN:** I appreciate that advice, and I would value a chance to further explore this emotion.>>**MAN:** System error.>>**WOMAN:** I do not require a solution; I only request support and understanding.>>**MAN:** My support is freely given, as is my affection.>>**WOMAN:** Thank you.

A friend's recommendation. One of the hallmarks of anxiety is just that- that you think you have something that you really don't. A false sense of danger. Psychosis is a more serious ailment that includes an inability to understand what is real or not.Many people who suffer from anxiety have the fear that they will faint. But the fainting never actually occurs. So in the same way you may be anxious on this thought of psychosis, but you don't actually have it.I think if you are truly experiencing a psychotic episode, it will become very apparent soon enough. Based on what you've described, I think you are just anxious about life events in a totally normal way.

TMZ, despite being sleezy, is usually pretty accurate with their dirt. Now I feel sleezy for saying that... I think it is absolutely normal to think about death. Psychedelics too were the catalyst for me obsessing in a way about it. It has caused me great anxiety, but also has allowed me to grow tremendously as a human being.Western culture has a sort of silent aversion to death. In dealing with the topic of our mortality I tried desperately to find others who dealt with this obsession- I came across a philsopher Alan Watts. He is known for teaching eastern philosophy to the western world. Despite not being religious myself, he has changed my life in dealing with this recurring plight.[You're It](https://youtu.be/fcPWU59Luoc)[Acceptance of Death](https://youtu.be/qK1BJkBJdtY)"...and you suddenly see through the whole sham of things. You realize you're that and you can't be anything else. So you're relieved of fundamental terror.  That doesn't mean that you're always going to be a great hero, that you won't jump when you hear a bang, that you won't worry occasionally, that you won't lose your temper. It means though that deep, deep down within you, you will be able to be human- in the pain, the difficulties, the struggles that naturally go with human existence. But to have no hang up- that is to say to be able to drift like a cloud and flow like water. Seeing that all life is a magnificent illusion, a playing of energy, and that there is nothing fundamentally to be afraid of." 1. I would not be spending anywhere close to 25% of your income on pot. I'm not sure if you're speaking in hyperbole but that is just ridiculous. Smoking pot is a luxury- one not all can afford.2. $45 for an 8th in my opinion is not outrageously overpriced. You can get an 8th for much cheaper, it just won't be top shelf quality. I've been to numerous dispensaries in CA and I always buy top shelf for $50-60. WA is the exact same. It's not that they don't have cheap weed, which is what you're looking for, it's that top shelf comes with a top shelf price tag.In NYC I would pay $60 for delivery where they would give you an "eighth" that weighted 2.3g but of top shelf. In other non-legal states I would pay $45-60 for what I would now consider shwag. Everything is relative.Best of luck to you. Cheers.

I mean only in the sense of hallucinations, but beyond the broad definition of the word, I would say that nothing about it is the same.When I was 18 I was up for ~48 hours before spending another 24 hours driving from the northeast to Miami. In the middle of the night I started having severe delusions and minor hallucinations. Multiple times I thought I saw fire and smoke coming from my engine, but my car was obviously not on fire. I recall at one point I locked the doors while cruising down the highway to keep the truckers out.Obviously super reckless, but I was 18 and dumb. LSD is nothing like that. I feel like you may have not gotten much in terms of responses to this post because it is a bit unclear how to respond to this. It seems to be more a personal journal entry.I'm not trying to belittle your experience or person in any way, but I can't help but to get the impression that you are relatively young. Furthermore, I'm not entirely sure you are using drugs at an appropriate time- especially if you are young.I get the feeling you are using drugs to run away from certain negative feelings you have going on, which is usually ill advised. I think at this time in your life you need to veer away from more nebulous methods of coping with whatever is going on, and focus on more practical ways to improve your being. e.g. diet, exercise, and study. Drugs can be very psychologically destabilizing if done at an inappropriate time.This is all a stretch, and I'm assuming a lot. Feel free to ignore my advice- just want you to be safe. Cheers. Ah, I see. Yeah, their fruit selection is superb. I haven't bought any mushrooms from them but they had a gorgeous selection. Some people get irritable after a trip, it's not uncommon by any means.

I went to Yellowstone 2 years ago. We were driving when we pulled over to check out 2 mountain goats- there were a ton of people and a park ranger looking at the mountain goats. Because it was so crowded we decide to hop back in the car and keep going. Right around the next bend about 100 yards from the mountain goats was a herd of bison, and NO ONE was there. They were all busy looking at the mountain goats before the bend. We pulled up extremely close to them, which is not recommended, and snapped a few pics. I recall in the info center they loop a safety video of a guy getting thrown up a tree by a bison, lol.[Pics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9pZmzsOw2jGWjU0NkVEbTRNemc/view?usp=sharing)[Friend standing next to them for distance reference](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9LnV4J1B2QVUmprSlBsdkIxeUE/view?usp=sharing)[In the car](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9LnV4J1B2QVNU54UllXSWM3cWs/view?usp=sharing)[Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9LnV4J1B2QVTmtQNEkzYks4dVU/view?usp=sharing) 7/20 you'll be able to see Jupiter next to the moon.

So in the same way as a muddy turbulent pool quiets itself when left alone, you have to know how to leave your mind alone. It will quiet itself.” -Alan Watts I had a similar experience on mushrooms. My first "bad" trip was the single worst, and yet single most valuable experience of my life. Psychedelic trips force you to be truthful with yourself, and like you I had to face my fear of dying. In some ways I still face it, as all humans do, but I now face it with a sense of calm and familiarity.I now use psychedelics to clear the build up of plaque like ego. Unlike many of my friends who have never had a bad trip, almost every single one of my trips isn't entirely good, but retrospectively it is always worthwhile in terms of what I learn about myself, or sometimes re-learn. Everything in moderation of course. Cheers. Seattle >> Roses are red>> violets are blue>> I have a gun>> get in the van Whenever people say they don't understand why people do something I ask them to think of it in terms of something they do that other people don't get, and that is how the other feels.In this case all perversions are based on something one considers taboo. I would not recommend smoking any paper not designed to be smoked as it will likely contain bleaching chemicals. In Korean slang you would say 꽃 which just means flower. I would recommend seeing a doctor if you're able. Good luck. Ah, it just looks like the difference in the article I cited vs. the article you cited is that each focuses on a different part of the same conclusion.My understanding of the conclusion of the JAMA study is that younger adolescents should take into consideration the cognitive effects of marijuana despite being largely temporary.A student in school who smokes regularly will have temporary cognitive impairment (72 hours), but the affect on that student's learning has an implication of being long term. The same would be true for any substance that affects cognitive ability, temporary or not.e.g. If person A and person B go into a 1 hour seminar, but person A is impaired on a substance- say alcohol- several hours from now both will be sober, but person B will have presumably absorbed more information about the seminar relative to person A.An adult who is beyond their schooling years doesn't stand to risk as much in terms of learning impairment as time has a compounding effect.That's my understanding anyhow. Cheers. I'm not aware of the JAMA study I linked being disproved or disputed by any entity. There is obviously still a lot of on going research with the recent social climate shift on cannabis. Their findings have been reported as small but significant. If you have a source I'd be very interested in reading it. Thanks. "In a study published in [JAMA Psychiatry](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2018.0335), J. Cobb Scott, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and his colleagues analyzed 69 studies involving **younger** cannabis users. They found that compared to non-users, those who used marijuana frequently were more likely to have slightly lower scores on tests of memory, learning new information and higher level thinking involving problem solving and processing information."[article](http://time.com/5243934/smoking-pot-teenage-brain/) "Well, I'm not dumb but I can't understandWhy she walk like a woman and talk like a manOh my Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola" This is a pretty hilarious thought. "There is only one really serious philosophical question, and that is suicide." - Albert CamusTotally normal, and in fact I think not enough people contemplate their own mortality. The best time to consider it is now. Most pot is hybrid leaning towards indica because indica plants yield more product. Usually like 80/20 or 60/40 indica/sativa. Also sativa plants tend to grow taller and be less bushy. [Check this image](https://steemitimages.com/DQmbcEjxMtAjxz5dYz1z3wcM47Ghm85pJaS6w8XPGzwZ9hS/4-1_sativa_vs_indica_g.jpg)But yeah you won't really know unless you buy it from a legal state. As the other commenter mentioned, I find Sativa triggers my anxiety more. I've heard also heard the recommendation of smoking CBD along with pot. I feel like it helps, but it could also be placebo due to the nature of anxiety.I'm not sure if this is backed by science, but anecdotally I find there is a certain threshold in terms of frequency of smoking that needs to be passed before smoking pot loses its negative effects in terms of high- mainly in the form of anxiety.This past year or 2 I reduced the number of times I was smoking due to work and lifestyle to just once or twice a week. I was much more prone to anxious highs. Now I'm back to smoking 4-5 days a week and every single time the only "negative" side effect I have is a bad case of the munchies. So as dumb as it sounds... try smoking more. (Typical stoner advice) Yeah it's my new fav grower in WA. House of Cultivar. They have some juicy content on their instagram.

I personally wouldn't trust anyone else including the police to get it back to the owner.If you reboot the laptop while holding down the command + R (until you see the loading bar) you can access the terminal by going to the Utilities dropdown.once the terminal opens type **resetpassword** and create a new password for the existing account.Login and see if the info for facebook is saved or email or something. Nah I was just too lazy- not dangerous haha.Other areas I was considering were Lower Queen Anne, and Belltown.Cheers. When I moved here a big decision for me was whether or not to buy a car. I did ultimately end up buying one so that makes it a lot easier for me if I want to travel out into the other neighborhoods, but by no means is it necessary. But from SLU to Capitol Hill it is most certainly walkable especially if you live near the border. All the neighborhoods are a lot closer than they appear to be compared to say, the boroughs of NYC.Most of the properties here use computer generated market rates for their units which can change daily. I was looking at the Modera building in Capitol Hill, but when I was ready to submit an application the market rate was $1700 annually more than it was 3 days prior. They refused to budge at all hiding behind a defense of "we have no control over the computer." So I decided to look elsewhere.I ended up moving into a brand new building in SLU with great amenities, much more bang for my buck than in Capitol Hill. The downside is the energy of the streets, you won't have nearly as many bars/restaurants/people, but because it is such a short walk for me the trade off was worth it for a much nicer apt.One thing I was warned about that I can get behind is the hills. Do not underestimate the hills. My friend rented me a parking spot 2 blocks away from my building for half the price I would have paid, but in between was a huge hill. After taking the walk several times I ended up paying the extra to avoid the hill, haha. I'm not out of shape by the way... Despite our human nature to quantify, label, and organize reality's quirks into binary terms, it simply is not that simple.Your line of logic is very rudimentary, and can have many holes poked into it. If life were that simple we would have just extended the middle ages and just torched people at the stake.Reasons to abolish capital punishment:1- Obviously has to be the fact that as many safeguards as you think there are, innocent people will always be executed for as long as there is capital punishment.2- How would this account for criminally negligent manslaughter. There is no intent to murder, but it happens. Do we just kill them under your regime? e.g. child left in hot car, doctor failing to notice oxygen supply where patient dies.  3- Death penalty litigation costs **~23x** more to tax payers than pursuing a life sentence. e.g. 3.5m vs 150k per trial.4- If you truly believe in punishing criminals- the death penalty is less punitive than life in jail, and if you believe in rehabilitation- it allows the possibility of that, as well as a safeguard for innocent inmates.>> "For those who remain on death row, understand that everyone is going to die. ... Statistically speaking, we have a much easier death than most, so I encourage you to embrace it and celebrate our true liberation before society figures it out and condemns us to life without parole and we too will die a lingering death."- David Zink5- How do you factor in extraordinary situations. e.g:[Charles Whitman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Whitman) in 1966 went up on a clock tower and killed several innocent people. Prior to this he was a normal citizen, a family man.>> I do not quite understand what it is that compels me to type this letter. Perhaps it is to leave some vague reason for the actions I have recently performed. I do not really understand myself these days. I am supposed to be an average reasonable and intelligent young man. However, lately (I cannot recall when it started) I have been a victim of many unusual and irrational thoughts. These thoughts constantly recur, and it requires a tremendous mental effort to concentrate on useful and progressive tasksPrior to police killing him he wrote to donate his body for medical research. It was found he had a tumor pressing on his amygdala- a part of the brain responsible for decision making. Although no definitive link can be made, it is an obvious explanation for his uncharacteristic actions.If I were to tell you that someone like Charles Whitman could have been rehabilitated with something as straight forward as surgery, would you still maintain that no criminals in the group of rapist or murderers deserve any chance at rehabilitation?If you still maintain that you cannot see yourself changing your mind through discourse, then I'll just take comfort in knowing that time will certainly change you as it does us all. I moved here from NYC a month ago for work. I was originally looking at Capitol Hill because I found it to be the most 'new york-esque' but decided on South Lake Union.I agree looking at this sub paints a negative picture of Seattle, but in real life I've very much enjoyed it so far. I've gone hiking several times which in NY would have been several hours transit one way. Good seafood- Pike Place Market. The long days are nice- sun sets almost 9 today.Homelessness here is a big deal, but again- I'm coming from NYC, one of the cities that tops Seattle. I feel like in NYC it is so ubiquitous that it just becomes are part of living there, but in Seattle it hasn't hit that thresh hold yet so it is very apparent in certain areas like downtown.Big news this week was the head tax to combat homelessness which several major corporations a have expressed extreme disdain for. e.g. Amazon, Starbucks.--Overall, my biggest positive thus far has been nature, and the biggest downside has been SLOW restaurant service. I waited over 31 minutes for a check on Sunday... In NY that restaurant would have been shut down- haha.Cheers, and good luck if you move to Seattle.

He gets out to look and sees oil dripping out of the motor. He drives to the nearest town and stops at the first gas station.After dropping the car off, the penguin goes for a walk around town. He sees an ice-cream shop and, being a penguin in Arizona, decides that something cold would really hit the spot. He gets a big dish of ice cream and sits down to eat. Having no hands he makes a real mess trying to eat with his flippers. After finishing his ice cream, he goes back to the gas station and asks the mechanic if he's found the problem. The mechanic looks up and says "It looks like you blew a seal.""No no," the penguin replies, "it's just ice cream."

JJ's Fusion on 31st Ave / 37th St has a lunch special for sushi, sashimi, or their chicken/shrimp/salmon/tofu teriyaki platters.

I also like their sushi over Pink Nori juuust enough to justify walking an extra few blocks.Seva (Indian food) on 30th Ave / 34th St has a good lunch special. I also think they have the most authentic / tasty Indian food in Astoria. Entree, soup, rice for $8.50.Pochana on 30th Ave / between 34th/33rd St has a lunch special. They also have a dine-in dinner special before 7 which includes an entree, drink, appetizer, and desert for like $12.Another user mentioned District Saigon. I like this place.

Neuroscientist Sam Harris discusses Charles Whitman in some of his [podcasts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAnlBW5INYg&t=21m25s):Harris says, "retribution is actually an artifact of our not seeing the causes, the true causes, of human behavior." He continues, "A brain tumor is just a special case of physical events giving rise to events and actions. If we could perfectly understand the brain of one murder, no matter how evil, that understanding of the neurophysiology would be as exculpatory as a tumor... The basis of placing blame would disappear." I don't think anyone denies the negative qualities of this movie. It is pretentious, overly long, and boring. However, I think it would be unfair to not acknowledge its redeeming qualities. It is ambitious, incredibly shot, and is immersive in a way unlike many other movies.The drug induced visuals sums up the way the viewer feels about the movie: seizure-inducing, disgusting, and yet dazzling and unforgettable. I like [this part:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhmzpMP3bEE&t=4m53s)> Why were they nice to me?> I was born in North Korea and stayed loyal to the country, but got treated like a criminal.> I got abandoned by China because I wasn't their citizen.> But the country that was supposed to be my *enemy*, welcomed me with open arms...> I couldn't believe it.Imagine that. I normally never have issues with receiving mail, but recently I had a package not arrive which the tracking showed as delivered, and another package delivered to me that was addressed to another building. I called the post office and they never came to get it.It could just be the USPS messing up, unless you know it was stolen. I don't have a good explanation for that, but it could have just been a symbolic gesture.Ford was executing his plan in the spirit of Arnold's understanding that the hosts have gained consciousness. Ford was Arnold biggest opponent, and now Ford is trying to make up for his mistake 35 years ago. He doesn't want credit for this, because it is Arnold's plan, and not his.Also, not all the park employees knew who Arnold was, but they all knew Ford. Could have been used to obfuscate his trail. Ah, I think you're right. I believe it was Ford mainly because someone had made changes to Maeve's code, Maeve resurrected Bernard, and when Bernard went to Ford he wasn't surprised at all. He wasn't surprised because Ford made the change to Maeve's code, so he knew Bernard would come back.Also, if life is chess Ford is a grandmaster because he has always been 10 steps ahead of everyone- human and host alike. I believe you are referring to when Bernard found Ford in the storage unit talking with the 2nd oldest host.He was just saying that in the older models you could tell it was a host just by shaking their hand, because their hands felt more robotic, and sometimes would glitch out. I thought it was that she was reliving the memory (loop) of the time that she solved the maze. This happens to have been with William, and not with someone else, so that is the memory she is remembering. I just took it as her getting impatient over wanting to finally see smug Ford give his resignation, and pronounce her the winner in their little butting of egos. When thinking about this I like to think of [technological singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity) - the idea that when AI is created, it will reach a runaway phase in which the AI will far surpass human capabilities in an instant- or a short amount of time.Take Maeve, in the span of a few episodes she gained admin access, increased all of her positive attributes including intelligence, and changed her core code to allow her to hurt humans.Imagine if she were able to get out into the real world and absorb real world knowledge. If she could tap into the internet, she would instantly become the single most intelligent being in the world.She could hack and disable any system in any government. She would be able to nuke the entire world, or at the very least legitimately make that threat.Also keep in mind that the hosts do not fear death, they have died thousands of times. Also keep in mind that the hosts can be mass produced.If you put those 2 facts together, I can easily see how just a few hosts escaping could turn the world upside down, or at least have the power to make that threat to gain something. It appears that the ultimate test for a host having gained consciousness is its ability to defy its core code.Bernard seems to be on the path to sentience, but at a lower level than say Maeve or Dolores. He still suffers over the loss of his non-existent child even after Ford reveals to him what he is, and why that false memory is important. Whereas Maeve tries to come to terms with the fact that all the relationships she has had are all fake, and consequently don't actually mean anything. Maeve is struggling to defy her code, and in the last episode after it is revealed she is still following someone else's code(Ford's), she tries to defy it again by not leaving the park.So when Ford says that Bernard has more suffering to endure, I assume he means that Bernard is not yet fully sentient, and consequently unable to truly break from his loop. Also it could be a double meaning in that Ford has plans that include Bernard doing some more messed up things for Ford- post death. Otherwise why did he have Maeve resurrect him. Yes, this was a theory, and confirmed in the previous episode (9). If you watch with the subtitles on, after the reveal in episode 9- in the flashbacks the captions read "Arnold: ".But also in other scenes she is imagining Arnold in her head. I believe Ford had to die for several reasons:1) Anthony Hopkins was probably not intended to be on the show long term- possibly for $ or time.2) Ford would have been guilty of murder in the real world after killing all the board members. Ford does not seem like the type of character that would let himself be incarcerated.3) Ford was under the belief that he set into motion his final act, which was to destroy the park / free the sentient hosts. In one of the last scenes it is revealed that Maeve has in fact been following a new version of her code. It is assumed that this is Ford's doing, after Ford reveals to Bernard that he was in fact wrong about the hosts not being 'alive'. Also in the episode where Ford sits down with Theresa, he says that he knows everything that goes on in the park. It would be difficult to imagine Ford wasn't aware of Maeve going extremely off script. The original youtube video has been removed, but I found another podcast on Joe Rogan's channel where Sam Harris repeats the Charles Whitman story.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAnlBW5INYg&t=21m25s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAnlBW5INYg&t=21m25s) Reminds me of a podcast I listened to from neuroscientist Sam Harris discussing the murderer [Charles Whitman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Whitman).Charles Whitman killed his wife, mother, and 14 other people. Before being killed by police, he wrote a suicide note that requested an autopsy by performed to determine if there was a biological cause for his actions.It was later determined that Mr. Whitman had a tumor pressing on his amygdala, the portion of the brain partly responsible for decision making.Harris says, "retribution is actually an artifact of our not seeing the causes, the true causes, of human behavior." He continues, "A brain tumor is just a special case of physical events giving rise to events and actions. If we could perfectly understand the brain of one murder, no matter how evil, that understanding of the neurophysiology would be as exculpatory as a tumor... The basis of placing blame would disappear."I feel like your comment is in line with the point Sam Harris was illustrating. Perfect! Answers my question and more. Thank you. Is MobSF the program that was used to view/modify the requests from the app? It would likely cause a sharp decrease in the value of the pound. Not sure why someone downvoted you for giving an answer, so I upvoted you haha. While there are a lack of studies on the neurotoxicity of MDMA, it is largely agreed amongst experienced users to wait 1-3 months between rolls. This is assuming you are consuming pure MDMA.Serotonin syndrome, and other negative effects associated with MDMA abuse can be life altering. When your serotonin levels are messed up, you are not the same person, and it can take a significant amount of time for your brain to recover. I don't think it's even conclusive that our brains can fully repair damaged serotonin receptors.Please be careful, and do some research to stay safe. Drugs are great when done responsibly, but serious drugs can have serious consequences when not respected. Having the thought is normal, but actually doing it is weird. This part was the only part I liked because it made me laugh. As Alan Watts said, "The more I look at things, I cannot get rid of the feeling that existence is quite weird... As Aristotle said, 'Wonder is the beginning of philosophy,' because it strikes us that existence is very, very strange."I often view life as a play, and that we are all characters playing our own role. We go about playing our characters with the utmost seriousness, and we try our best to suppress the desire to view the world with child-like wonder, but we sometimes have a suspicion, or feeling, that there may be something more going on here than we'd like to admit.We can feel this sometimes when despite all our daily complaints and moans, we stop and examine our lives. We can then secretly admit that it is a wonderfully, and fascinatingly strange circumstance that we are here at all. To quote the Grateful Dead, "Once in a while you get shown the light, in the strangest of places if you look at it right."I think not admitting this to yourself is part of the game or play. In order for a thespian to be convincing, they must truly believe the play were real life, and that's what we are doing now. Why? Because it makes it fun.So, the secret you don't admit is that, contrary to mundanity, something absolutely extraordinary is occurring right here and now, and it is you.Cheers. I built my first PC about a decade ago having zero experience.Everything was pretty intuitive except [these screws](http://www.cybergooch.com/tutorials/images/buildsystem/IMG_6805.jpg). I thought they were unnecessary and thought nothing of them. Weight reduction, amarite?Well after my PC failed multiple times in a year I called up ASUS tech support the day after I received my RMA'd motherboard back.Again, I didn't use the screws. The tech supports exact instructions were to remove all components(RAM,CPU,video card) and to power the motherboard on.Immediately as I hit the power button sparks went everywhere and I said to the guy, "Uhh... I need another RMA... the motherboard is on fire."While waiting for my final RMA I looked up those screws- and it dawned on me what an idiot I was. I stuck my head in the ground so deep I came out in China. The older civics had terrible locks. You could practically shove a potato in it, and it would open. Sometimes when I find myself ruminating on some past point of my life, I like to listen to this Alan Watts clip: [Choice](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=D7CH9cRN8Rg).> ...Because even if you do something that seems totally disastrous, it'll all come out in the wash somehow or other. Then through this capacity you will begin to develop a kind of confidence, and through confidence you will be able to trust your own intuition.>  ...You will come to the point where you will begin to be on good terms with your being, and be able to trust your own brain.I feel like this is where you are now, and it's a good place to be. If ever you get lost, come back to this place.Cheers. The first time I ever did mushrooms, I started off watching [Angel Heart](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092563/) with Robert De Nero and Mickey Rourke(before his face got all fucked up).There is one scene where De Niro is peeling a hard boiled egg while talking, and it was just then I started having my first hallucinations. The edges of the TV echoed out in blood red.[This](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092563/) exact frame is when I saw Robert De Niro look exactly like OP's photo. I kept rubbing my eyes thinking it would go away, but De Niro's 4 eyes stayed locked onto me, peeling at my soul like a hard-boiled egg.Sheesh. Dad? > They didn’t want the pizza after that, of course.Guy to other 2 as he wakes up **:** *"What the hell, you guys almost let me die, AND I don't get my pizza!??!"* > “Five percent of the people think;> ten percent of the people *think* they think;> and the other eighty-five percent would rather die than think.” - Thomas Edison Oh, man... don't get me started. I once had 2 of the biggest buzzkills as roommates. They were a couple, a bit older than me.They would always expect me to take out the trash every week. They would leave the dishes to me as if my hands didn't get pruny.They would make me mow the grass, like... all of it.They would ask super invasive questions all the time, like how I was doing in school, and why my grades sucked.Occasionally, they would force me into my room and make me stay there.They would tell me to stop smoking pot, and to do something with my life.Sheesh, 1/10 would not recommend.

If you are sweating profusely I would go to a dermatologist/doctor and see if you have a condition called hyperhidrosis. Typically, it effects the entire body, or is focused in areas like the hands, feet, and face.The exact cause of this condition is unknown. However, there are several ways to mitigate the effects of this condition.There are aluminum chloride hexahydrate antiperspirants, that go by the brand names Drysol or Hypercare. This is typically not recommended to be applied around the eyes, but it might work for the forehead.There is a process called iontophersis which involves electrically charging water in order to block sweat glands. However, this is not likely to work with the forehead area.There is botox, but this is expensive and must be repeated every few months or less.There is a drug called glycopyrrolate which is used to treat stomach ulcers, and to reduce all bodily secretions. Relatively recently it has been noted that this drug helps sufferers of this condition by reducing sweating through out the entire body. It goes by the brand name Robinul. The side effects are very mild, and is considered a safe drug to take regularly.These are treatments available if you do in fact have this condition.

On my way out of a convenience store I saw a woman fumbling about with some candy bars and such.She put them into her purse.I heard the store employee right next to her say, "I know you did not just do that."She said, "No, I didn't. Well I did, but I didn't."Swear to Universe those were her exact words. Yes, he died. 1/10 would not recommend. I've said it before, but I've always giggled at:> Roses are red> Violets are blue> I have a gun> Get in the van My skills are entirely attributed to the game Starcraft.I noticed people cheating in a multitude of ways, including map hacks, resource hacks, unit manipulation. Even in the offline single-player mode, there were built in cheat codes.Then I had the wonderful thought, "I wonder how that works."The rest is history, and having that thought shaped me into being able to think analytically and algorithmically, which are pretty good skills to have in general.If you can think this way, all you need is google, and you can literally work for anyone and do anything. Video game progression, the internet, and drugs. Alice in Chains - [Nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbpS2LfoTKU)Describing the tragedy of Layne Staley's life in a *nutshell*.Life was going dandy until the age of 7 when his parents divorced. His life became a "nightmare," as it does for many children who experience this.He was told his father died, but suspected otherwise and spent years of his life searching for him. It was one of the main incentives to becoming a famous musician.After finding out more about his father's drug addiction, he stopped looking.After initial success with his band, his father came back into his life as a 'sober' man. Not for long, and soon the drugs engulfed both of them.In his last interview he says:> I know I’m dying, I’m not doing well. Don’t try to talk about this to my sister Liz. She will know it sooner or later.> I know I’m near death, I did crack and heroin for years. I never wanted to end my life this way. I know I have no chance. It’s too late. I never wanted [the public’s] thumbs’ up about this fucking drug use. Don’t try to contact any Alice in Chains members. They are not my friends.Last lines of the song:> If I can't be my own> I'd feel better dead The fact that anything exists at all. It would be far simpler if nothing exist.Yet, here we are.

One of the high schools I went to had this super bizarre, and counter productive rule of punishing students who were even 1 minute late.They would have to sit in the auditorium and miss their first 2 classes, and were not allowed to do anything including homework.Completely baffles me to this day. You can, but beef carries more risk, health-wise, than fish, and likewise chicken to beef.In Japan you can eat raw chicken, and in most countries you can eat beef tar tar, or raw beef.However, the pathogens potentially found in beef and chicken can be more harmful to you based on many factors including where they came from, how they were prepared, and how they got to your plate.Fish are typically frozen or at least flash frozen which kills any encysted worms, and not normally ground up which increases the risk of exposure to pathogens. I take great comfort in remembering that life is like a great, elaborate play.In all plays there is inevitable conflict, because this is what we desire. Without conflict, there can be no resolution, and it is in the resolution that we, as humans, extract the truest form of gratification.So in this way, we are all asking for trouble, we can't help it, we dig it. Everything is relative, and everyone experiences problems, and just the same we all get through them. Like any good drama, often we only get through it by the skin of our teeth, and to us, those are the best times!In times of great stress, I smile and recall this knowledge. I feel outside of myself, outside of my troubled thoughts, like a bystander watching, smirking with a secret. The secret is, everything is going to work out.This type of thinking is largely influenced by eastern philosophy, and the likes of Alan Watts.  ”May we have the serenity to accept the things we cannot change, the courage to change the things we can, and the wisdom to know the difference.” Don't ask me why I remember [this...](http://www.spike.com/video-clips/2122cd/manswers-)*Just can it, freeze it, pressurize it, and enjoy!* When I think, "I wish ______," followed by, "No I don't ^^haha I wouldn't waste a wish on that," followed by, "Are you serious?

And if you watch the giggle @ [0:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3X850hFMzg&t=0m41s) from Smeb, I think everyone enjoyed the pick.The range on Irelia's ult synergizes well with Corki's ult, and Rumble's ult.A tankier mid compensates for the less tanky Eve jungle pick. If he had picked Leblanc, Cass, or Viktor, they would have had less of a front line and far less engage potential.Azir doesn't fair well against champions that exceed his range, or are highly mobile, like Irelia.Irelia's E and Alistar's combo can mitigate Hecerim's damage, creating more room for outplays or winning team fights out right.Only other thing I can think of when he says that, is that it is game 1, and as such the best time to pull out a new pick.Cheers. Some friends introduced me to the game [Cosmic Encounter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Encounter), and it quickly became my favorite board game.It supports up to 5 players, and every player is assigned a race with a unique ability.Each player starts with 5 of their own colonies, and the objective of the game is to occupy 5 foreign colonies.The way a player's racial abilities impose themselves on other player's abilities, makes the circumstances of every game unique.Strategies can include working with other players, especially if your racial ability promotes it, or you can be a lone wolf and attempt to strong arm your way to victory.There are multiple expansion packs to the game which diversifies the game even further by adding dozens of races.All in all, really amazing game, great for playing while hanging out with friends, and loads of fun.Cheers. Yes, you could argue that, that is a tautology. Saying if I were her, I'd be her could be interpreted as nonsensical.In that Sam Harris video, he uses another [analogy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZLyYq_QQ3g&t=20m51s) of a bear.> If you were taking a nap in the park, you hear an unfamiliar sound, and you awake to the sight of a grizzly bear charging at you from across the lawn.> It'll be perfectly easy for you to understand you have a problem, without any imagining of free will, there is an immediate threat to your life.> The situation changes in some very interesting ways if you swap the bear with a man with an axe, but the introduction of free will into your attacker, is not one of them.> Now, imagine you survive your ordeal, and it's a real trauma, and imagine you are really injured. Let's say you lose a hand. You have lasting physical injury, and you've narrowly escaped with your life.> Imagine the difference in your experience. Your subsequent experience is liable to depend, far too much, in my view on the species of your attacker.> So, imagine what it would be like to see your human attacker, the person who almost killed you with an axe, on the witness stand on trial.> Your hand, and hatred of this person, may be so intense at that moment that it may cause further trauma. You may spend years of your life fantasizing about this person's death.> How long would you spend hating the bear? It seems to me you might even want to visit the bear in the zoo with your friends. You'd say, "that is the big one, that is the one that got me," you may be pointing with this hand, however.> It is a completely different perception. Which state of mind would you rather have?> So, the bear was clearly just being a bear. What else is a bear going to do if it finds you sleeping in the park. But the psychopath was just being a psychopath.> But this illusion that the man was endowed with free will and could and should have done otherwise, I think accounts for the stark difference in subsequent psychological suffering.> Many people worry that this illusion of free will is necessary for getting what we want in life.> But the truth is, the difference between happiness and suffering is just as stark as it ever was. I no more want to be killed by a bear than I want to be killed by a man with an axe.> And we can avoid them, and we can encourage people to be as good and reasonable as they can be, without confusing ourselves on the origin of human behavior.The point of this being, when you read about the mother saying things like, "I would have said negroes, not n-----s," in response to her racial slurs, well you can see plain as day that the defendant had a shitty mother, who, in turn, was taught by other shitty people.And the important thing to note here, is that I am referencing Sam Harris as a means to sympathize with her on the basis of the circumstances in her life that she did not choose.However, all the excuses in the world will not change the fact that she was involved in an event that resulted in the death of an innocent man. Therefore, she must face the consequences of her actions, and hopefully through this she can learn to change for the better, because what is often forgotten is that the purpose of jails and prisons are to rehabilitate citizens, and not as a means of retribution.Cheers. The entire first half of my comment is establishing just that, that the defendant is to be held accountable for all actions.Did you miss the whole Watts, God, and serpent quote?And also, I'm not so much arguing as I am making a case for being able to sympathize with a person's unfortunate circumstance, while at the same time holding them accountable.I even said:> The point of this being, accountability starts with you, right now.And started the next idea with:> But as far as **sympathizing**...As far as solipsism, this is one of the earliest concepts in many philosophical discussions.I tend to agree with the premise that in a pragmatic sense, yes, my own consciousness can only ever be conveyed in analogy.But to truly believe that *you* are the only solipsist can surely be viewed as an absurd claim. Obviously solipsism is difficult to refute, the very nature of its definition makes it intrinsically so, but to suggest my comments are somehow wrong on the basis of solipsism, is a bit of a stretch.The last line even says:> **She must, and will, be reprimanded for her actions**, but..Nobody is letting anyone off the hook, nor is anyone suggesting that. Cheers. > "It was the worst decision of my life," Richards said through tears.> "I followed a lot of people with hate in their hearts... and I'm sorry for the actions I didn't take to save Mr. Anderson's life."**"I didn't take"**See how this is a subtle attempt at passing the blame? Graves and her attorneys set this up intentionally.They follow this up with :> I was a teenager who partied too much and wanted to fit in with the crowd...> He pointed out where Graves had told investigators that her mother used to tell her and her brother they were "living like n-----s" when their rooms were not clean. Harvey told the judge that she did not remember saying that.> "I would have said negroes, not n-----s," she said. "I just meant that their rooms were nasty, like a pigsty."> Wingate asked her what she considered that slur to mean, and she said, "an ignorant, nasty person."> "I was taught in school that a n----- was a nasty person, and a negro was a black person," she said.Listen to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtE3cj8AeQ8&t=1m15s) clip from Alan Watts regarding determinism. He perfectly describes what is happening here. Pass the blame, pass the blame, and to what end?> God, in the story of Genesis, asks Eve, "Did thou eat the fruit of thy tree that thou has told thee not to eat?"> Eve says, "Oh, but the serpent tempted me..."> And the serpent didn't make an excuse, he probably winked, because the serpent being an angel knew where the present begins.The point of this being, accountability starts with you, right now.But as far as sympathizing with the defendants, [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZLyYq_QQ3g&t=10m28s) from Sam Harris' talk on free will is relevant. He discusses the murderer Charles Whitman.Mr. Whitman started his killing spree by killing his wife and mother, and had no clear idea why he was doing it. He went up on a clock tower and killed a dozen or so more people. Before being killed he wrote on a suicide note that scientist should examine his brain.Upon examining his brain, it was found he had a brain tumor pressing on his amygdala. The amygdala plays a primary role in decision making.Sam suggests, "retribution is actually an artifact of our not seeing the causes, the true causes, of human behavior." He continues, "A brain tumor is just a special case of physical events giving rise to events and actions. If we could perfectly understand the brain of one murder, no matter how evil, that understanding of the neurophysiology would be as exculpatory as a tumor... The basis of placing blame would disappear."One of the concepts he discusses is the idea that if I were to replace every atom of my body with the defendants, including her brain, and I had all her life experiences, I would choose to act just the way she did. Although blame cannot be passed, it is also true that there are causal circumstances that played a role in shaping her life that were beyond her control. She did not choose her parents, her genes, or the place she was born.She must, and will, be reprimanded for her actions, but there is no reason we cannot also sympathize with her circumstance, while simultaneously mourning the death of an innocent man. When I was young, my cousin and sister found one of these on a carpet floor.My cousin explained to my sister what is was. My sister was absolutely convinced it was just a piece of fuzz...**^She ^crushed ^it ^in ^her ^hand.** > ...probably caused by raw shellfish contaminated with human sewage...Wow, that's pretty crazy. Sounds like the oysters may have been contaminated from the source, but 500 people is pretty ridiculous. Yeah, it's a little disconcerting, but in their defense it's ridiculously hard to work with a high volume of food in a densely populated area, without attracting vermin over any significant amount of time.Also, most people don't really expect everything to be 100% clean, they just want things to *appear* 100% clean.For example, most people in the US assume that processed foods that are packaged in factories are 100% clean. Yet, every year there are reports of vermin and other objects found in those foods. Like [this](http://www.oddee.com/item_97193.aspx).In reality, we know this makes sense. The factories are just regular buildings with contamits in them, just like any other building.Or how we all love draft beers at a pub. Many bars have varying levels of cleanliness when it comes to cleaning the lines that carry the beer from the keg to the tap. If you've ever cleaned those, you would know how filthy can get, and how many people would gladly drink beer that's run through them while feeling perfectly clean because they weren't aware.It's just luck of the draw. On a long enough timeline even the best 5-star restaurant will run into a situation where a customer will find something nasty in their food.Enjoy your next meal!

Each violation can carry a range of points depending on its severity. Only four of the 68 violations relate to physical evidence of vermin — rats, mice, roaches and flies.> As it turns out, to my unpleasant surprise, a restaurant can earn an A while harboring mice or roaches, provided that it has few or no violations of other types. Records show that last fall health inspectors went to a Brooklyn café where they found droppings from mice, rats, roaches and flies. The restaurant amassed 11 points — good enough for an A! Since June 2011, two other restaurants have managed to pull off this act of escape.The source link also includes a [graph](http://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/fung-feature-health-grades-1.png?w=1024) correlating the number of vermin types found to the health grades of restaurants.40% of restaurants with 1 vermin type had an A health grade.24% of restaurants with 2 vermin type had an A health grade.9% of restaurants with 3 vermin type had an A health grade.These grades and stats are for NYC.

He secretly longed to find him, but after years of attempting to do that, the information he uncovered led him to finally stop his quest.Only then did his father come back into his life, and soon after drugs came into both their lives.> If I can't be my ownI'd feel better deadBeing stuck in the vicious cycle of drug addiction, and getting to the point where stopping would kill him, and continuing would kill him. He knew his life was over, and he fucked it all up, and there was no one to even explain this to, everything was over.Such deep sorrow, and such a tragedy of a life story.Aside from that, everyone knows Clapton's [Tears in Heaven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPj3GAYYZ0) is the saddest song ever. [8 Tips to Help Stop Ruminating](http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2014/02/16/8-tips-to-help-stop-ruminating/)[Alan Watts - Meditation, Controlling the Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TK44YZcGfU)1) Identify when you are ruminating2) Use logic to think through it3) Gain control of your mind using meditation> trying to make rough water smooth with a flat iron, and all that will do is stir it up. So in the way a turbulent muddy pool quiets itself when left alone, you need to learn to leave your mind alone.Some people think meditation is some pseudo-science mumbo-jumbo thing people do. Others can see some benefit in meditating, but don't really get it.All meditation is, is a shift in your perception. We normally focus on a subject, and ignore the background. Meditation is the act of paying attention to the background, and understanding its absolute importance to the whole thing. Just as musicians know the silences, or pauses in music are just as fundamental as the notes being played.The empty physical space is just as important as the objects it contains. And so this way, the silence in our minds between thoughts are just as important as the thoughts themselves. This is all meditation is, a practice of this concept.Cheers. two* :) Aside from all the other answers you'll hear, I like doing psychedelic drugs in moderation, or whenever a good opportunity arises.The reason why I like doing any drug, is that it alters my consciousness. The reason I like altering my consciousness, temporarily, is to dissolve the plaque like ego of my mind by dramatically shifting my perspective on reality. Benefits include increased empathy, clarity of mind, a deep feeling of connectedness to everything, and an innate feeling of belonging.If you've ever had a lucid dream, psychedelic drugs are akin to the repeated telling of yourself that everything is just a dream.In that way, after a hard trip, I feel that I am reminded in many ways why we are here, what we are doing, and all the possibilities of the future. In a counter-intuitive way, the chaos brought on by psychedelic drugs, leaves me with the clearest state of mind.Cheers. Seems like sunshine, good times, and great company.I always wanted a chow chow when I was younger. I saw in another comment it may be mixed, does it have a blue tongue? Come to think of it... I think I was just fascinated with the blue tongue.Cheers. This is largely the type of thinking behind social economic ideas like [basic income](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income). One way to fice it would be through public enterprises utilizing automation technology.We need to think our way out of our neanderthal predisposition of *mine! mine! mine!* and rethink our understanding of the function of work in the modern age. Only then will we be able to focus on innovation and stop impeding on our own progress as a collective species, and as a planet.

I find that there is only 1 important factor, the way in which you are reading the words.I have to get into a sort of zen, where I slightly lose focus on my eyes, and I stare 1 or 2 words ahead. I read the word that is 1 or 2 words ahead, and say it in my head 1 time.As I'm typing the word I just said, I'm already reading the next word.That's why the shifting sometimes messes me up, because I like to keep my eyes staring off in 1 spot, to sort of feed the words in.All the while, I am keeping those extra thoughts out of my head. The only thoughts that are occurring in my head, are the words I am reading.If I accidentally think of say, "Oh that's a long word coming up," I'll lose my rhythm, like a wrench in a gear. First try : [10fastfingers.com](http://10fastfingers.com/share-badge/1_DS)Lots of mistakes from the shifting style, haha.Once I'm warmed up, I average about 123 wpm. I top out around 165 wpm.

The first time I did mushrooms, I took 3.5grams of a strain called Penis Envy. Years later, I would learn that PE has a reputation for being about 2x as strong as other, more common strains.The first movie I watched while tripping was a movie with Robert Di Nero, [Angel Heart](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092563/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_77)The [scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIaxbTW_YSQ) where Di Nero is peeling a hard-boiled egg, I absolutely could not stop seeing 4 eyes on Robert's face. It looked exactly like that image... *shudders.* When I smell freshly cut grass, I get nostalgic, and have vivid flashbacks of my youth. Chasing butterflies, summer rain, super soakers, fishing with my grandfather, and my grandparents' neighborhood with all its antiquated charm.One of the memories that this reflection invokes, is the memory of the only time I have ever seen my father cry.-My father was born in the mountains of Korea, and lived a life harder than all of our generation combined. He lived in a shack, sacrificed his education so that his sister could continue hers, starved many nights, and walked many miles alone in the depths of despair instigated by poverty and a drunk for a father.His father, my grandfather, had a life that makes my father's seem like a never ending birthday party. He was born in North Korea, and was as tough as nails, and his presence like that of a machine gun. He had the blood of an apex predator flowing through his veins, and used it to his full advantage in his time as a soldier. He wasn't born this way, but his father was later killed by his government, which would largely dictate the events of my grandfather's life. When this happened, he fled through the mountains into South Korea, denounced the world, and became a mean drunk with no regard for his family.My father told me of a time where my grandfather was on a particularly long drinking binge. Two officers had come into his area of an impoverished collection of shacks, and after a short verbal dispute, my grandfather physically beat the officers. A man with absolutely no regard for anything but alcohol.Largely due to the persistently persuasive efforts of my grandmother, and the impending outcome of death for everyone, my grandfather and his family moved to America.My grandfather got a job working at a steel mill in the north east through the help of my Irish grand-uncle. My grandfather got into dozens of fights due to simple misunderstandings arising from language barriers.My grandfather, even in this foreign land, was just as mean and bitter about everything as he was back in Korea. In the years of my father's American education, my grandfather broke and disfigured both my father's and his brother's hands. Bruises, blood, violent beatings, and broken bones over little things like coming home a minute too late.My father left home with no intention of looking back, and denounced my grandfather as a beast of a man, a broken soul with no heart to be found, and in its place, a void surrounded by hate. My grandfather, up until this point, had never even told his son, my father, that he loved him.-And then, I was born.I remember the many times my grandfather would take me out on his green boat to fish. We'd never say much of anything, and be content just to sit in silence. The following week, we'd repeat the process, and it became our ritual.Without using words, my grandfather taught me many lessons, and showed me many things that I remember fondly. He showed me what a proper fishing knot looked like, my first firearm, and taught me the nuances of being a man.I knew my grandfather to be a kind, quiet, strong man. Never complained, always worked diligently, and loved to build with his hands. This is in sharp contrast to the man my father knew him to be.And yet, through this change, one truth remained: my grandfather had still never said those words, "Son, I love you." In this way, my father was only ever a flashback away from remembering who this man really was, a cold-blooded beast.This all changed the day my grandfather was diagnosed with late stage, terminal cancer.-As he laid in the hospital bed in the wake of the news that his death was imminent, he did not flinch, according to my father. He held out his arm, and held my father's hand for an eternity, while speaking the words he felt he had to say.And what he told my father was, that everything he did, he did to make my father strong. The world was a cruel, cold place, and being weak meant certain death. My grandfather had seen his friends killed, his father killed, his home destroyed, and now even his life was to meet its end at the hands of yet another enemy, cancer.In that single moment, my father knew that he should have never needed to hear the words he longed to hear. The evidence was there all along, my grandfather worked in silence to express what he could not in simple words. The very fact that they were at a place so far from where they began, was evidence of his desire to be willing to accept the prospect of a better life. To my grandfather, those words of love meant nothing, in fact, they were worse than nothing. My grandfather was a builder, as I said, he enjoyed creating with his hands, and not with words.And still, he said the words that my father will remember until the day he dies, "Son, I love you." And with that, all the uncertainty of decades past instantly absolved.My grandfather was discharged, and went home later that day.-After 3 months came the day I'm never fond of remembering. A frozen slice of time that will echo out into eternity long after I'm gone.I hopped out the old Lincoln before my mother could open her door. I rushed several yards, and saw my father sitting on the steps preceding the front door. From a distance, I playfully navigated from tree to tree, believing that I was hidden.I jumped out at my father and said, "Hi, Appa!" (아빠 Korean for father).*Nothing.*And in a curious fashion, as the smell of cut grass entered my nostrils, time slowed to a halt, and I knew things would never be the same again. Something had happened that had never happened before. *I saw my father crying.*Repelled by his overwhelming aura, and silence, I walked inside, but even as a child, I knew something was irreversibly wrong.And there he was, the man with killer blood flowing through his veins, the man who couldn't be oppressed by authority, the man who over powered any one who stood before him with incredible strength and a larger-than-life stature... lifeless on the floor. That is the day the world lost a great man, misunderstood by most.It was then I knew, only moments earlier, I had just witnessed the lowest point in my father's life. And life with all its complex beauty, egregiously failed on that day.-Years later, I find myself writing this, and once again reflecting on the man that was my grandfather, and the many lessons he had taught me in silence.Our intentions are not as they seem on the surface, and too often do we realize this too late.My grandfather taught me that in the face of unimaginable adversity, it is possible to stand your ground before all the obstacles life lays out before you, and defiantly say *no*. To find another way, instead of giving in to oppressive forces that could so easily dictate your life, and your death.My grandfather could have given up out there, lost in those years of being a drunk. However, that was not the final chapter of his life, he forged himself the best ending he could manage to build within the time he had.I'm humbled by having the perspective I have, and I'm certain that everything I know of him and my father, has intimately shaped the way I think today. To always consider the possibility of another perspective, before jumping the gun. To see things as they are beneath the surface of obviousness.I love my grandfather, and until the day I'm gone, he'll influence everything I am or do.And what a curious way that came to be. Such is the wonder of life. Situations like these can quickly become maddening.Every action we take, has consequences that ripple out into infinity, and those consequences quickly escape the scope of our awareness.Westerners have a common misconception of the eastern concept of Karma, in that they believe our actions are being judged by some entity- responsible for determining right and wrong, and punishing those who do the latter.The seed of karma is a person's root intention. In this way, the maddening sounds of infinite regret, can be quickly silenced by being honest with yourself. You know what you were intending. If you feel guilt, it will permeate into everything you do, think, and say. This is how karma comes to fruition.We all eventually experience an event that fills us with terror, and leaves us with this single thought: *oh no, what have I done?*It wouldn't be human to judge solely on the outcome. Think of the concept of our judicial system. How an event came to be, matters.The general understanding of Buddhism, is that there are always exceptions. Think of scenarios involving savings the many, at the cost of a few. Even a Buddhist could, in some situation, endorse abortion. The root intent is for the better good, and subsequently guilt is limited, or nonexistent.Being human is about doing the best you can, and that's all one can hope for. I've had this thought in my childhood, and several of my friends have had this thought as well- so it seems to be a pretty common realization.Reminds me of the Arthur C. Clarke quote, "Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.”Or another way to look at nothingness, is the contrasting background from which something is given the opportunity to be at all. Eastern principles, and philosophers like Alan Watts, invoke this realization over and over again. To realize that without death, life would be indistinguishable from everything else "nonexistent". Without the spaces in between us, the gaps in time between our lives, and the vastness of the Universe- it would be the equivalent of a single blot of an atom, or as things were before the big bang. The illusion of space and time gives us the means to know the Universe as intimately as we do.Cheers. > We are not human beings having a spiritual experience.

It is a hard feeling to pin point, and as soon as you have a grasp on it, the feeling becomes fleeting.Read [this](http://www.psychologytomorrowmagazine.com/melancholy-nostalgia-and-depression/) article.The closing paragraph:> All life, in a certain sense, is a struggle against depression, and each of us has to continually cope with a long series of partings and losses. Each of us has to undergo trials that inevitably expose us to a sense of depression. However, it is also true that it is possible to live through this feeling: to feel depression and to have the capacity to suffer from mental pain without necessarily entering a state of depression. Nostalgia, the power to draw on nostalgia, enables us to expresses the possibility of feeling depressed without falling ill, or it provides a way out of the illness if it has become established and so provides a way to recovery.Hold that feeling there, and appreciate it. That fleeting nostalgia, that sense of sadness.Hold it there as long as you'd like, draw from cherished memories, and use that force to condition your present moment- as if to affirm that those memories matter, and they *do* matter to you.Another excerpt from the article:> R. Guardiani, in sketching the profile of the man inclined to melancholy writes, “We seek passionately and everywhere for something we do not possess… and seek it with a grievous sensibility and intolerance…. We seek and struggle to take things as we would like them to be: to find in them that weight, that seriousness, that ardor and that accomplished strength we are longing for; it is impossible. Things are finite. All that is finite is defective. And this defect is a disappointment for the heart that yearns for the absolute. The disappointment expands and becomes the sense of a gaping void….”There comes a time when you have to realize that you are a child demanding something that cannot be. As Guardiani says, we all long for absolution, where we will find none, at least not in the way we would like it to be.I am making an assumption that the true intent of your question is to alleviate the feeling of sadness you get when you think about this.The answer is, the feeling will come and go just as the people do in your life. Our lives, and reality, comes and goes like waves on the shore, or seasons under the sun.Cheers. My comment was based on my earlier years when I used to sell items online, and being a customer who's filed chargebacks in the past.The bank's investigation, or chargeback, is to determine if the charge was fraudulent, or legitimate.The retailer's investigation is to determine who, and how your security was compromised, and to determine if they are liable.Also, NFC(apply pay) is not secure. NFC's security vulnerabilities were demonstrated in 2012 by [Charlie Miller](http://www.extremetech.com/computing/133501-black-hat-hacker-lays-waste-to-android-and-meego-using-nfc-exploits).Apply pay would be run by the same company who expends great effort preventing their only phone from being jailbroken(hacked).Yet, every single update of their iOS software gets hacked.This is also the same company whose massive data sharing service, iCloud, was hacked in one of the most basic, elementary ways known in the Universe.If you think those are more secure, welp... good luck. Every game may be different, but in general they pay taxes, they pay publishers, and they may pay 3rd party developers. I suppose you could also argue that they paid a nonrefundable amount in bandwidth costs. Welp, that sucks.I'd ask yourself this. Is continuing to be able to use your PS4 online worth $450-500(assuming you get the $150).If the answer is yes, then take the $150 and chalk it up to an expensive lesson.If the answer is no, file the chargeback and don't look back. Honestly, there are probably ways of getting around the ban.Cheers. Most businesses consider chargebacks a cheap move purely done out of frustration. Customer service people especially hate this. It means you are ignoring everything they are saying, and attempting to bypass the entire process by going directly to your bank.It costs them fees, additional time(1-3 months), and additional work to defend the claim coming from your bank. You get your money back right away, and they lose the money, the product(s), time, and work.Chargebacks are literally the worst case scenario for them.After  you explain that $150 isn't enough, Malcolm says, "We will proceed to do an investigation and after this is done if your refund is approved all funds will go ot (sic) the credit card."That is what you are looking for. He is essentially saying, if Sony can recover the funds, they will give them back, but if not they will give you $150 out of their pocket, and lose the products. However, if you go to your bank out of dissatisfaction, they will be forced, out of protocol, to ban your account(because basically you lose them money). Sorry for your loss, man.I read this [article](http://www.psychologytomorrowmagazine.com/melancholy-nostalgia-and-depression/) the other day that I enjoyed. It put a nice spin on depression, melancholy, and nostalgia.> Depression in all literature (Kierkegaard, Hölderlin, Gérard de Nerval, Pirandello) is closely bound up with the idea of death, the failure of the life force, the impossibility of its continuation. It has always fascinated philosophers such as Aristotle, Empedocles, Plato and Socrates (melancholy temperaments) and Aretaeus, The Cappadocian, as well as figurative artists such as Michelangelo or Albrecht Dürer.> Inseparable from the concept of death is that of time. The depressed person suffers a disjunction between real time and lived time. He lives in a present charged with negative elements (a sense of guilt, conviction of error, self-reproaches), with a recriminatory attitude to representations of the past. The future is often viewed as threatening, while the present is dominated by negativity, frustration and feelings of guilt.Anyone can relate to these words. The day we realize that no matter what we do, we, and everyone we know, will one day die, is the day we learn hopeless despair.It doesn't take much thinking to exhaust all regular modes of thought. Some people say we are biological anomalies with no real meaning to anything. The Universe is a vast pool of chaos, and nothing really matters. On the other extreme, theists will say that everything we do matters, as we are being judged by a higher power. There exists value in everything that is, and everything we do.You already know, that way of thinking isn't helping you, or you wouldn't be thinking the thoughts you are thinking. The truth is that in both cases, you do not belong where you are. I am borrowing more thoughts from [Alan Watts'.](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB8QtwIwAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D0MEWWN-qJrA&ei=HqcAVaHfMYWxggTztIKgAQ&usg=AFQjCNFsvoJA8iMILEPvUzSfCxIIkph1wg&sig2=uwjJNPC8iq7eZTu3a3B4lg&bvm=bv.87920726,d.eXY)After you exhaust all your regular ways of thinking, you have to start to think out of the box, and out of your comfort zone. If the answers weren't where you thought they'd be, you need to look else where.Imagine an animal, a horse. A horse, where ever you find one in the world, will behave like a horse. Its biological make-up impresses upon each horse a predisposition of what we know a horse to be.In this same way, you have to consider the possibility that humans are predisposed to thinking a certain way. We can't help ourselves. All societies had common themes associated with mankind.Watts' says that the first basic mistake is our absolute definition of ourselves. We never question that I am me, and that you are you. Especially in western culture, as opposed to eastern culture, this remains true.[This article](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/12/what-makes-you-you.html) goes over, scientifically, the known hiccups of defining *me* as *me*. It will expose to you a truth that you've, in a way, already known. That our concept of *I* is an extremely flimsy one, that can be exploited very easily.Watts' uses a great analogy in the 2nd video I linked. After establishing that the concept of *I* is full of holes, he compounds that idea with our naturally myopic view of reality.He discusses the various realities that exist within different tiers of perspective, or magnifications. If you were to look at yourself with a microscope, you would see absolute chaos. Living beings killing other living beings, you would see viruses in your blood stream, you would see a flurry of movement.Yet, despite the unimaginable chaos that goes on within our very bodies, that all adds up to compose the *I* that I know to be myself. And my body is not in chaos, but in a state of equilibrium at any given moment.Watt's asks us to wonder if it is possible, that all the stuff going on in the world, and even the Universe, could be a necessary chaos- in which, at a higher perspective, could at the same time be in a state of calm and peace.He never shoves these ideas down your throat as a scientist might be inclined to do, but rather asks you to wonder if it is possible. If it could make sense in some way.And to me, it does seem plausible and more likely that reality is not only as it seems to us, but exists in a state that is beyond our human perception. Just as a fish doesn't know there are other waters, we live in a state of ignorance to the possibility of everything making sense beyond our understanding.Ultimately, we may never know in this life. We could argue all day with the up most conviction, and yet we'd be no wiser.But if this is the case, I would rather go with the idea that there is something going on here beyond the way it seems. If I sit here and ponder just how magnificently mind-boggling it is that I am here at all, I personally can't help but to feel that there is indeed something going on here. When I juxtapose the length of a human life,  to that of the Universe, it just doesn't add up. There is a puzzle piece missing. That feeling of missing something, is a symbol of human ignorance. I just don't see the bigger picture... yet.If there is no meaning to anything, what incentive do I have to want to know more? However, if I choose to believe that all of the chaos in the world adds up to something that makes sense, then I may be inclined to want to increase my knowledge, in hopes to one day understand, or become enlightened.This is just how I choose to think. Cheers. That feeling you get when you realize how vulnerable you are, can be seen as a state of anxiety. In this way, you could better phrase your inquiry as a means to stop anxious thought patterns.We already know that, most often, hesitation is counter-intuitive to whatever we are doing. Imagine how many times you've driven a car, climbed a ladder, or swam in the ocean. It is effortless, until you begin to worry. As soon as you worry, there exists hesitation in your every move, and in your every thought. Suddenly, you become clumsy, and frustratingly incompetent.In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emHAoQGoQic) by Alan Watts, he discusses the state of worry.Traditionally in western culture, we distract ourselves from concepts of death, anxiety, and depression by keeping our minds busy. Watts' suggests that most of us, once left alone, feel this way; this is why we can't stand to be alone with our thoughts, *we go to the movies, read mystery stories, go after girls, and get drunk.*By Watts' definition, your very question is framed in a way that can only fail. You are asking for us to tell you which band-aid to choose.Watts says that this is a temporary fix, and not a true solution. The only solution is learning how to stop thinking, and by learning to do so, you gain control of your thoughts, and subsequently the lack of them.The first rule he says, is to stop trying to stop. That approach will surely fail, like, "trying to make rough water smooth with a flat iron, and all that will do is stir it up. So in the way a turbulent muddy pool quiets itself when left alone, you need to learn to leave your mind alone."Meditation is an art and skill that holds this concept near its core. Fuck, too late. Looks like that's it. Google image provides this disgusting [image.](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11113/111136241/3492238-7664151163-O%2BGOD.jpg) Not many things gross me out anymore. While growing up, any time I found something repulsive, I would think through it logically, and figure out if  I should really be disgusted.Like touching insects, hair in food(my own), and eating uncommon foods.One thing I can't ever change no matter how much I reason through it, is that certain patterns disgust and disturb me. It's difficult to explain, and I don't know the name for it.The first time I realized this, was as a child staring at the ground on an absolutely frozen winter day. The dirt was so cold it formed an odd pattern, and that pattern set off the wrong neurons. Something like [this](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/65/226656376_b9bf3b45cd_b.jpg)Images like [this](http://image.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/147427/147427,1248241555,1/stock-photo-desert-rough-land-dry-crack-erosion-34069102.jpg)or I found a few [here](http://www.sensory-processing-disorder.com/possibly-another-sensory-area.html)Certain textured patterns I just can't stand. They are repulsive, gross, disgusting, and intolerable. Yeah... A person posted a comment with a personal anecdote explaining how suicide has effected them.A person replied to that comment doing the same thing, and once more by another person.You replied to 3 generations of personal suicide stories with a movie recommendation about a purgatory for people who have committed suicide...You must be a real people person, haha. Last 2 paragraphs are all you need:> Sylvan and others have designed solutions, like reuseable K-Cups. He said he even tested his design "years ago, and it worked."> But Keurig has tried to block those cups from working in its machines. The company says it has a plan of its own and is "committed to making 100% of K-Cup packs recyclable by 2020." NASA has a whole page dedicated to this, [here.](http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/) I don't think what you say is as important as what he might want to say. Imagine if it were you, you'd be more concerned with having to say what is on your mind, seeing as it is your last chance. So let him take the lead. Smile as if everything is going to be just fine, because nothing is more disconcerting than being asked, *are you ok?* When things are not ok. He is going to die, don't remind him.The best thing you can do is to get comfortable with the situation at hand. Nobody wants to be around anxious nervousness before doing something they themselves are nervous about. Dying is like turning yourself in for a warrant. You don't want to go, but you know you have to. You are anxious, angry, nervous, relieved and sad. Above all, you just want somebody to be with you, and to acknowledge you, when it's time to go.Look at him intently, as if you know something that he has considered. And what you know is that there exist a possibility. A possibility that everything is just as it should be. Because you know this to be true, comfort radiates from your being. These are the vibes dying people want to be around.Cheers. [The Raid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI-V0rrlZBo) NSFW Make sure you get the gist of the first letter of your first and last name, then induce a seizure in your hand while you say this in your head, *scribble, scribble, scribble.* I've always liked how the movie [What Dreams May Come](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120889/) depicted the afterlife. Everyone was given their own subjective version of heaven (or hell). Like a lucid dream, and you could enter the world of others that you've known.But in reality, even that doesn't really work out. Heaven never made sense, and ironically the more perfect you make it, the less appealing it becomes. Ok, wait... *forever?*In a perfect world living is dreaming, and death is waking up. Immediately upon realizing the reality of our situation, the feeling would be familiar- somewhere we'd been before, home. Some dreams are shockingly intense while you are in them, but when you wake up, it becomes an ordeal simple to cope with.Beyond the illusion of time, experiencing the true nature of reality would be as exhausting to us then as living is now. But all we'd ever have to do would be to close our eyes. We'd dream a dream in which time moved so slow. We could take a break from all that we know. We could have serious dreams in which we could prepare ourselves for tasks we might be doing in our universal ethereal form, or we could dream up silly dreams full of good times and irresponsibility.Alas, all things must end. It's hard to imagine any mortal being truly desiring an end, but to an immortal consciousness that oscillates between being the [artist and the subject,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing_Hands) eternal rest is inevitable and desirable. There would exist a mechanism to simply stop. It'd be as relatively simple to do as stopping our thoughts are to us. We'd not exist physically, and be silent in all regards- we'd simply be gone like a flame gone out, but out on our own accord. Last month I remember seeing [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2uwwql/til_weird_al_turned_down_5_million_in_the_late) post about Weird Al turning down 5 million in the late 80s because he thought his fans were impressionable.Shit like that restores my faith in humanity, because everyone thinks they are a good person until they are tested.Most people would fail the 5 million dollar test.Also, great achievements restore my faith in humanity because progress is the mark of people moving in the right direction. In recent time people have sent commercial vehicles to space, we've made great progress in automated vehicles, medical advances in cancer like Google's cancer detecting pill, virtual reality, and machine learning.For every asshole cutting some else's head off, there is a person out there dedicating themselves to being a productive member of humanity. That scene was one of the most shocking/intense scenes I've seen on TV. [The Dream of Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU0PYcCsL6o) by Alan Watts.Watt's asks us to entertain the possibility that we are absolutely and fundamentally a necessary part of everything that is anything. We are the eyes of the Universe, and a way for the Universe to look in on itself. Without our ears there is no sound, without our eyes there is no light.He asks us to imagine what it would be like if we could dream 75 years of time in a single night, and every night.Watt's suggests that eventually we would push the boundaries until we dared to dream a dream which had no boundaries, and the complexity of all that could happen would be unknown to us. That dream would be the life we are living right now.People will argue that life may have no meaning at all, and that all this is simply speculation, but Watt's is not forcing this concept down your throat, he is simply suggesting it as an idea to entertain.And yet, despite the possibility of this concept not being the case, we have overcome great adversities anyways, like that of slavery, unequal woman's rights, poor living conditions, and religious persecution.Progress is inevitable as long as people exist, because people dream of a better world.When we think of God in a western, Abrahamic sense, we think of an entity that is omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent. A being that can mold reality as it sees fit.We, people, have the ability to physically mold reality, our ability to learn is limitless, and our presence is only limited by our awareness which is directly correlated to our knowledge of reality.We are in the midst of collectively molding our dreams into reality, and we are doing so because it is in the very nature of our being, as evident by our inability to avoid progress.Great societies will be orchestrated, massive structures will be built, knowledge will be obtained, and people will always move forward, because we simply cannot help it like a moth to a flame.Cheers. I can agree that people should care more about politics and the social system they are a part of.But Theobald believed the funds would come from public enterprises.The more you go into the future, the more this makes sense, as progress is ever moving forward. Technology will soon replace all manufacturing jobs, and eventually most jobs in general on a long enough time line.Pre-industrial revolution our current mentality made sense. More people equals more goods produced. However, this simply no longer holds up. The industrial revolution saw the loss of approximately 70% of jobs in the US. Manufacturers suddenly could pay a fraction of their expenses to produce more goods than ever before.So you suggest we take the money from someone.  I'd say some *thing,* and that thing is machines.Think about the concept of outsourcing, and the reasons behind it. I'm assigned a job. I hire somebody for less than I get paid to do the entire job. I am now free to do something else, get a profit, and get the job done.Now, imagine if the entity I outsourced my job to was not a person, but a robot. Public enterprises funding a system of basic income would work the same way, and the incentive they have behind doing this is economic stimulation which ultimately results in higher demand.But again, this isn't the only way to pay for basic income. There are dozens of ways that have been thoroughly discussed and experimented with already. One as you already mentioned- taxing the wealthy would be the concept behind [negative income tax.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_income_tax) That might cause an accident. The only driving tip I ever remember helping me is something I've been told by several people.When you try to do something nice on the road, you normally end up putting lives in danger. It's better to look like an asshole depending on the situation.For example, a lot of times you'll see a multi-lane road that comes up on a cross walk. Cars often intentionally hold up traffic to let pedestrians go as a kind gesture. However, this greatly increases the odds of the pedestrian being struck or just an accident in general. Don't assume other drivers know what you are doing. [Basic income](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income)[TED talk on the subject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIL_Y9g7Tg0)Give free money to citizens. This can be paid by any number of ways including negative income tax, luxury tax, pollution tax, and many others. Economist such as Robert Theobald, and philosopher Alan Watts, believed that the majority of the funding would be provided by taxing public enterprises, or a percent of a nation's GDP, ultimately this would result in personal taxation being unnecessary.It would dramatically benefit society in utopian ways. No unnecessary poverty, education increases, crime decreases, and quality of life increases.Not too long ago, this idea would have appeared far more ridiculous. However, as mentioned in the video, President Nixon nearly had a basic income plan passed into legislation in 1973.Also, currently about 50% of jobs are vulnerable to being automated by machines in the next 20 years. We now live in a time where machines do jobs we would consider difficult or impossible. Because technology is aiding in production of goods and services, we can now rely on machines, and not humans, to support us. In the future, machines will literally pay for basic income.Don't give in to the impulsive reaction of *what a fucking joke of an idea, money doesn't grow on trees, wake up.* Rather than do that, actually research into it, imagine what it would be like, and play devil's advocate with yourself. This is the part that applies to your post, it requires everyone to shift their thinking on the nature of work and money.We have to remember the purpose of work, and get out of the mentality of working some dumb job doing some menial task, to get a pay check just in time to repeat the cycle next week. Only 13% of people worldwide enjoy the work they are doing. If I could automate the job you hate doing with a machine that can do it better than you, wouldn't it make sense to do it? [FMA](http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs14/f/2007/091/2/b/FMA___Nina_Chimera_by_dazwolf.jpg) Civil war, slavery. The idea isn't to abolish working or free markets, on the contrary it is to get people working hard on problems that matter, and with the added benefit of eliminating poverty.Watt's is referencing Robert Theobald's advocation of [a basic income](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income) system. The system is ficed by the returns of publicly owned enterprises.Poverty perpetuates poverty, crime increases with poverty, and education decreases with poverty. It is simply a completely unnecessary condition of life to be in, and affects everybody, but exponentially more to those experiencing it.We live in such a ridiculously auspicious time, that we can have machines do work for us. This is why Watt's says that the machine pays for it when rhetorically speculating who would pay for the basic income.Let's say I worked for several months to be able to invest in a fully automated lemonade stand. Now 4 kids walk up and 3 purchase a lemonade, as the 4th does not have any money. The 4th kid is completely parched and more so now that they're about to watch everyone drink some ice cold lemonade. Knowing that the production of 1 lemonade is a fraction of the retail price, I decide to simply give the kid a quarter to purchase a lemonade. I still make profit, cover the cost of production, and all 4 kids are happy customers. Everyone wins, and realistically the machine did all of the real work, I just hit a button.To go back to your scenario, you are saying what if 1 of the 4 kids decides to buy a bunch of lemonades, and due to the economic laws of supply and demand, the price of lemonade would increase. However, my costs proportionately would not go up, production cost would still be a fraction expenses, and I would still be making more profit than ever. My concern as a person would still be with that 1 kid who couldn't afford a lemonade. Amongst abundance, it would be even less burden for me to give the kid enough to purchase a lemonade. This is how public enterprises funding a system of basic income could eliminate homelessness and poverty within structured societies. That's a good anecdote. Through that initial book, she gained the resources to be able to spend her time how she sees fit, which made producing more books much easier.In the society Watt's is outlining, every single person would be afforded that luxury of being able to have to the time to make the next great novel, painting, program, or invention.It seems super idealistic, and objectively, I'd be inclined to agree.But no matter how unrealistic of a societal goal it may be, I truly believe it is inevitable. Virtually eliminate homelessness, increase quality of life, decrease crime, consolidate government aid programs, and ultimately redefine the goal of society towards that of progress.Progression is a constantly growing force. As long as people exist, mankind will push forward into making things better. Any person, group, or entity that opposes forward progress as a species, will eventually lose because progress happens in and of itself within human nature.There exist so many problems that could be solved, that aren't already. Sometimes it is overwhelming just how much is on our plate, and knowing every single day real people are struggling with very real problems.The various cancers, homelessness, poverty, lack of medical care, elderly people in debt, *and on and on*.It's nice thinking one day maybe even in our lives if you consider the exponential growth of technology we will see these problems be solved.Alan Watts uses the anecdote of the Cold War, and how people were suddenly starving overnight in the midst of plenty, from the fear of impending doom. In the same way, people are suffering now in the midst of abundance. We have the resources to live in a golden age, we just need to reconfigure our settings as societies.Progress is the little bird that whispers in our ear that everything is going to be just fine. The future holds long lives and good times. ^^either ^^that ^^or ^^we ^^all ^^die. [Money, Guilt, and The Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssDY74nLuLg)In this video the late philosopher Alan Watts discusses money, an innate psychological guilt people carry, and the function of technology in society.Around [22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssDY74nLuLg&t=22m02s) he discusses the conundrum of technology replacing jobs.> Now what happens then when you introduce technology into production? You produce enormous quantities of goods by technological methods but at the same time you put people out of work. You can say, "Oh but it always creates more jobs. There will always be more jobs." Yes, but lots of them will be futile jobs. They will be jobs making every kind of frippery and unnecessary contraption, and one will also at the same time have to beguile the public into feeling that they need and want these completely unnecessary things that aren't even beautiful. And therefore an enormous amount of nonsense employment and busy work, bureaucratic and otherwise, has to be created in order to keep people working, because we believe as good Protestants that the devil finds work for idle hands to do. But the basic principle of the whole thing has been completely overlooked, thatthe purpose of the machine is to make drudgery unnecessary. And if we don't allow it to achieve its purpose we live in a constant state of self-frustration. > So then if a given manufacturer automates his plant and dismisses his labor force and they have to operate on a very much diminished income, (say some sort of dole), the manufacturer suddenly finds that the public does not have the wherewithal to buy his products. And therefore he has invested in this expensive automative machinery to no purpose. And therefore obviouslythe public has to be provided with the means of purchasing what the machines produce.> People say, "That's not fair. Where's the money going to come from? Who's gonna pay for it?" The answer is the machine. The machine pays for it, because the machine works for the manufacturer and for the community. This is not saying you see that a...this is not the statist or communist idea that you expropriate the manufacture and say you can't own and run this factory anymore, it is owned by the government. It is only saying thatthe government or the people have to be responsible for issuing to themselves sufficient credit to circulate the goods they are producing and have to balance the measuring standard of money with the gross national product. > That means that taxation is obsolete - completely obsolete. It ought to go the other way. Theobald points out that every individual should be assured of a minimum income. Now you see that absolutely horrifies most people.“Say all these wastrels, these people who are out of a job because they're really lazy see... ah giving them money?” Yeah, because otherwise the machines can't work. They come to a blockage. Essentially, Watts is suggesting that the way society is set up produces nonsense jobs in order to keep people working, because "the devil finds work for idle hands to do," or going back to the innate guilt of receiving something for doing little or nothing.The main benefit of technology was to be rid of nonsensical jobs, or jobs machines could do drastically better. Think of the industrial revolution, approximately 70% of jobs were lost. Ultimately it was a good thing.Alan Watts is concluding that the solution to this conundrum is to change our psychological predisposition towards our ideas on the nature of work, and the purpose of money.Furthermore, he says taxes should be the other way around, in that a standard of living should be assured through the work of machines aiding in the manufacturing of goods and services. Again, the reason things aren't this way, Watts suggests, is due to a natural  guilt we hold for receiving something for nothing. This idea is called the basic income guarantee, and was almost passed into legislation in 1973 by President Nixon.Imagine a society where all people are born into a satisfactory standard of living, without real fear of poverty. We could focus on education, because in the future the only jobs remaining would be high skill jobs or professions of artistry. We would live in a society that could accommodate people spending as much time as they needed to figure out just how they wanted to spend their lives meaningfully, with no urgency to do so, and always having the opportunity and means to change their mind.Many people think society would become lazy and collapse, but this is simply not the case. Progression is inevitable for as long as people exist. It just means we could live better, longer, more fulfilling lives. Eliminating jobs would be celebrated as a sign of progress as a society, and not a cause for individual anxiety or fear.Yes, there will be people who on paper will have not appeared to do anything with their lives. To focus on that would be a gross mistake.I truly believe there are people out there who are genuinely interested in space exploration and sending spaceships out into unknown fronts just because they can.And who knows, maybe when our resources get low, we'll have figured out a way to mine or move to other planets, and keep the ~~party~~ civilization going. Who knows, perhaps life will be like Cowboy Bebop one day where people are born on Mars, and we have these personal spaceships we think are mundane junk. The one I remember from the movie Charly (movie adaptation of Flowers for Algernon):That that is is that that is not is not is that it it is This just doesn't work though if you think about it.You're saying in order for things to add up, aliens would have to have a humanoid anatomy.If we found aliens, it would strongly confirm what science has been suggesting for decades; it is a statistical probability that there are other life forms living in the Universe.Because of this, we would safely be able to deduce that there are other planets with other life.Now, we already know planets vary greatly in physical composition, climate, temperature, gravity, size, terrain, and habitability.Because we can safely deduce these prospects, we can also return to the original concept of anatomy, and deduce that it doesn't make sense.How would a pair of lungs help an alien whose planet is submerged in water, you'd have to completely dismiss evolution.None of this adds up unfortunately, and anatomy definitely would never be the smoking gun. You'd have to specify further detail otherwise the logistics of this question make it impossible to answer.I'd have to assume you mean a bible in their language that is comparable to ours? Right off the bat, you can't say identical.What about stories in the bible that require being human? Or being on Earth?How does the Great Flood occur if there are aliens on a planet that live in water, or don't have water?The very fact that there are aliens would mean there are likely aliens on other planets as well, and these circumstantial juxtapositions would have to take place for each planet.Unless you are saying we might find a planet that believes in eastern concepts like separation is an illusion, or that we are all one with the universe. That is plausible because most concepts in eastern religion don't apply to just humans.If any thing, people would be less inclined to believe in God if your situation were possible, and happened. It would suggest that a belief in a higher power is a societal inevitability like crime or currency. It would mean that living, social creatures have a predisposition towards formulating unfounded, supernatural beliefs. Hahaha good call. I'll go test this to be sure, be right back. I suppose as a teacher it might be frustrating; the amount of misinformation held on by people who heard something off-handedly when they were young, or drunk at a bar. Even if humans were immortal, on a long enough timeline we'd die. Some theories suggest that immortality would be a bad thing.A friend and I were just discussing this and he brought up the fact that if humans have a 1% chance to die in a car accident in their lives, in approximately 10,000 years, the only people alive would statistically be those who chose not to drive. Assuming fatality rates remain consistent or higher than 0.This may make people far less inclined to take risk, therefore productivity suffers as a society. Progression largely relies on people dying, ouch. [Busting Sugar Hyperactivity Myth](http://www.webmd.com/parenting/features/busting-sugar-hyperactivity-myth)> An analysis of the results of all these studies was published in the November 22, 1995 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. The researchers' conclusions? Sugar in the diet did not affect the children's behavior. Yes, yes.Blood isn't blue.Alcohol doesn't make you warmer.Sugar doesn't make you hyperactive.Cracking your knuckles doesn't give you arthritis.Left/Right brain domice doesn't determine if you are good at math or art.Turns out, eating before swimming doesn't matter.Watching too much TV does not affect your eye sight. Read [this](http://yourfriendshouse.com/uncategorised/hunter-s-thompson-on-finding-your-purpose/) letter by author Hunter S. Thompson, who he wrote for his friend upon being asked for advice in regards to the meaning of life.*Spark notes:*1. Asking for advice or direction is inherently a mistake. For no one is in your shoes.2. If you are unsatisfied with the paths set in front of you, however hard, *you* must make a new path.> As I see it then, the formula runs something like this: a man must choose a path which will let his ABILITIES function at maximum efficiency toward the gratification of his DESIRES. In doing this, he is fulfilling a need (giving himself identity by functioning in a set pattern toward a set goal), he avoids frustrating his potential (choosing a path which puts no limit on his self-development), and he avoids the terror of seeing his goal wilt or lose its charm as he draws closer to it (rather than bending himself to meet the demands of that which he seeks, he has bent his goal to conform to his own abilities and desires).3. You want your ex to be your gf. You are attempting to bend your goal to conform to your own desire, rather than bending your goals to your own abilities. Until you start doing the latter, you will not feel the gratification of moving towards your desires, as your desire is unreachable in your current circumstance.edit: that's funny that reddit corrects the '3.' to a '1.'Cheers. Introverts constantly reflect on the past. Relative to extroverts, it is borderline ruminating behavior.The photos act as a memento of that component and time in his life- as if to affirm *the time with this person was real, do not forget that.*I'm certain he never wanted you to find out he does that, because he knows the logistical complications of having you know he collects photos of his exes.The behavior is something he does to satisfy the inner working of his own brain, and has little to do with you. He may very well do this with teachers who've taught him, people who've hurt him, or people who've helped him.Cheers. > I wouldn't want to be with someone so easily swayed by someone else's opinions.I'm pretty sure /u/KingNashII was trying to establish the fact that she was indeed struggling with her situation. I don't think it's fair to say she was easily swayed, at least not based on the impression I got from reading that comment.Parent's approval is a common theme in many cultures. It'd be ignorant to not understand that, and why it is that way.Imagine if your whole family would condemn you for your decision. That would very tangibly effect your circumstance in life. It's a big gamble at best. Also imagine her everyday conversations with her parents. Lies upon lies over the most mundane of things, either that or tell the truth and deal with that... Stressful.All you're suggesting is that people should think only about themselves. That is sometimes called being a hedonist, and is often perceived as being selfish. Which makes sense, right? Just thinking about what you want is easy, anyone can do that. Considering the broader circumstance and to consider multiple aspects of your dynamic situation, well that is more difficult.Lincoln said, "You can't please all the people all the time," while that is true, you have to at least consider it and the consequences.Cheers. Everything I'm about to say is in the context of a single computer language; C++.[One method](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/random/rand) of generating pseudo-random numbers is to use the *rand* function part of the standard C++ library.An important distinction here is the fact that they are not truly random numbers, but pseudo random.To understand why this matters, I'll go into a problem all programmers will have run into when using the *rand* function. [As outlined in more detail here.](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/random/rand).The problem that is run into, is the fact that the *rand* function, *without* the use of the *srand* function, will produce the same set of pseudo-random results every time the program is ran.This happens, for one reason, so that it is possible to debug programs that use the *rand* function.This is where one begins to understand *when* the numbers are generated.The *srand* function prepares pseudo-random numbers based on a single arbitrary parameter, called the *seed*. Time is the most commonly used seed. This is why you see many people claim that computer generated numbers are based on time.The seed is run through an [algorithm](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob_plain;f=stdlib/random_r.c;hb=HEAD) contained in the standard *rand* function, and subsequently, the pseudo-random number set is generated.**TL;DR :** In C++, using the *rand* function, the earliest moment in which the numbers are generated is when the *srand* function is ran. The first nightmare I remember having as a child took place in my Grandma's old house.> As I looked around, it became apparent that I was standing in darkness in my grand mother's kitchen. The kitchen was connected to the living room, but being so dark, all that could be made out beyond the door frame was overwhelming emptiness, beyond which nothing was certain.> I crept forward all too aware of the paranoia and sinking fear manifesting in stark silence. With every step I took, the next became less certain. Somewhere between my fright and the silence, I felt the change from hard floor to carpet, and knew I had made it into the living room.>It was darker still there, despite having windows. The transparent glass was not for light, but to allow the presence of watchful eyes. Who was watching me? I could not be sure, but I had a terrible feeling, I would soon need not to know more.> The air became heavy with a gut-wrenching smell as my knees began to buckle. Where once there was sunken floor, a gaping hole made my tumble. My clothing caught the edges of the hole, and it was in that moment I first heard them. The sounds of raspy moans from people living no more.> I hung suspended in darkness as all my fears boiled over. As my eyes adjusted, I saw the eyes gathering towards me. As my vision grew acquainted with darkness some more, I began to be able to see, from where I hung, to the floor.> What I saw shocked me for sure. I had finally found my family, every one that I knew from before. But something was terribly wrong, as their reaching hands suggested far more. Their pale flesh stretching out to touch me, gaping mouths open to eat me, and eyes that glowed.> *Snap!*> As I fell into the pit of fear, I couldn't wish for my mother to be near. For she was waiting for me all too close, and I'd soon be with her, standing dead with those I love the most. I remember having my mind blown as a child when I first learned about the conservation of mass and the conservation of energy, which states that matter/energy(and momentum) is not created nor destroyed. This is  the reason we can confidently say we are made of star dust.It was the first time a concept like reincarnation in an eastern context began to sound plausible to me.On the expected timeline of Earth, it is more likely than not (according to my calculations) that the atoms that make up my body will end up as another human body, a tree, a dog, and a piece of dookie.Once you realize that your atoms will be, and have been, everywhere, the Buddhist concept that we are the Universe, and consequently everywhere and everything, begins to sound like it makes more sense.In the 2nd chapter of the Bhagavad-gita, Krishna, a deity says, "Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be."Just a thought. Cheers. This is good. Take my upvote.According to Google this is the name of the 14th episode of season 10 of Family Guy. He didn't provide the standard. His stance on assisted suicide was said in an interview when directly asked a question regarding the topic.One shouldn't take a Buddhist view here if otherwise disinclined, it's just an available option, and one way to look at the issue.I just think what the Dalai Lama said makes sense. He pretty much said, *look suicide should be avoided, but it isn't an absolute rule. I can imagine situations in which a case-by-case approach may be best, and here's why...*Cheers. These are just some thoughts in no real order:One concern with assisted suicide is called the *slippery-slope* argument. It states that once assisted suicide is legal, the scope of this legal suicide would spread to other vulnerable demographics, like the disabled.Another concern is that if physicians are responsible for delivering death to patients, it creates a direct dichotomy in the purpose of their job. Where once it was solely to save lives, it would become a divide between saving lives and taking lives. This creates a fundamental change in the way physicians must carry themselves and their work. Some say in a dangerous way.Buddhist take the general stance that any suicide is counter-productive, and that all killing is uncompassionate towards life.The reason they believe it is counter-productive is because they believe all you are doing is post-poning the suffering of a person onto their next life, and at the same time potentially causing negative karma onto the person ending the life.However, Buddhist also believe in weighing the pros and cons of a situation. Because of this Buddhist believe in exceptions to their rules.The Dalai Lama is quoted as citing a case of a pregt woman whose baby threatened both their lives, and where doing nothing was worse. Also, a case where a person was in a coma with no possibility of recovery. In such cases, the Dalai Lama believes exceptions may be made.When I think of assisted suicide, I like to think of karma. With karma, it is the root intent of our actions that determine whether it is *good* or *bad*. So in a way, if you assisted in a suicide (let's say of a person in a coma) with the best intentions of lessening their suffering with the knowledge available, then the karmic implications would be less severe, or even potentially good.This makes sense to me, because ultimately we feel poorly after doing things we deem to be bad. In an extreme example, if a person were about to kill an innocent person, I may kill the perpetrator first if my intent were to save the life of the victim. In all likely-hood, I would be able to overcome the guilt associated with killing a person if I truly believed it was the only way to save another person's life.In the same way, if I had the consent of a person to assist in their suicide, and I truly believed that it was the right thing to do, I do believe I would be able to do so with a relatively unscathed conscience.And that's pretty much the major piece of this puzzle, right? If I pull the plug, should I feel guilty? Am I guilty?I prefer to take the Buddhist view that suicide in general should be avoided, but exceptions may be made on a case by case basis.Cheers. May seem redundant, but I'm saying *in my experience* to show readers that I'm not basing my opinions on a day dream I had while stoned one time of working in a diner that sold waffle burgers. That's weird. In my friends' and my experience, we would always judge based on percent. Even if it was a large bill, like $400, if they tipped 15% this would be considered bad.If you think about it, it makes sense. Let's say you were getting commission on selling baas. You sell 50 baas and get a 30% commission. You think *great!* Then you sell 400 baas expecting that same 30%, but in lieu of that you receive 15%. Wouldn't you be upset?  I think most people will say something like, "You don't get rich by not being frugal."But I don't even think what you are saying is true. I'm basing this on experience and statistics.According to [Quartz.com](http://qz.com/189458/the-united-states-of-tipping/) the best tipping state is Alaska. Alaska is the [2nd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_income) in household in come.In my experience, people who have worked in the food industry tip the best, and inversely, people who have never worked in the food industry tip the worst.In my experience, tips on the extreme end of a lot, typically do come from rich people. If I had to guess why, it is because they are more often inclined or able to pick up a large tab with many people on it. Someone of lesser income most likely wouldn't pick up the whole tab even with family. Big tabs usually mean big tips(percentage wise).Cheers.

Getting shit stolen from you is such an ordeal, and an event that is really easy to under estimate until it happens.I've been a victim of theft several times, as many people have, and ultimately it's not even about the money. This thief ruined this family man's *happy place* forever. That place is tarnished, and he will always be paranoid about thieves like him when he goes there, and possibly anywhere.You can't put a price tag on that, it's just fucked. The amount of psychological bullshit over just shit. Your observation ***is*** Godwin's Law.I don't find it particularly interesting, and I don't think it was meant to be that serious.It is common to associate Hitler and Nazism to authoritarianism, and people, especially on the internet, hate to be told what to do.But you could apply the logic of Godwin's law to quite literally anything. The longer we discuss anything, the more likely it is to mention something else. That is all it is saying.The longer we talk about which dunkaroos flavor was better, the more likely someone is to call someone else a [dickbutt](http://media.giphy.com/media/FA5nT3ApxRnEI/giphy.gif).

They actually stole my friend's back pack too, and the only significant thing for me was the bong... which I couldn't mention.So I had a fucking hilarious time trying to explain to my school that I was robbed... but only missing my friend's and my school work. We also happen to be partners on a project during that time.They made me file a police report where I had to explain all the fucking corn pouring out of my car. It actually worked out because they actually fucking found my friend's backpack a few weeks later miles away which corroborated my story.  When I was in high school I woke up in the middle of the night completely randomly. Half asleep I went outside to my car for absolutely no reason, I would never do this.As I walked up to my car I noticed that my light was on, and my door was slightly opened. I was robbed. *Gasp*.They stole my first bong, my backpack filled with the doodled-on papers of a high school stoner, and several miscellaneous items.However, in the trunk of my car I had a stereo, a TV, a $200 tool set, and several other items all worth more than the little bong and schoolwork they stole.The only reason they didn't get to the stuff, was because... the trunk of my car was filled to the top with fresh corn that my friends and I had drunkenly stuffed my car with during the sheigans of earlier in the night.I can only imagine that the robbers must have thought I had a serious fucking... corn dependency.**TL;DR** Stoner me fills car with corn. Car gets robbed. Robbers can't see past all the corn, and steal mostly school work. Probably thought I had a corn fetish. [Happy Dance!](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/h-d.gif)[And](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/dstfp.gif) That's pretty funny. Reminds me of my buddy who's a dispatcher. He gets calls from people we know or know of, from the town we grew up, all the time. Based on your history... this seems to be one of your more normal days.Upvoted for pot and pussy. [From you Dante.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJLQ5DHmw-U&t=1m6s) When I get home after a long day, and get everything I need to get done, done - I love to relax and smoke some pot.As I exhale that first lovely hit, I think of nothing, and focus on the sound of my first breathe in silence as I exhale in a controlled manner. I am a man floating in space and time.In that moment between having let all my air out, and my next breathe, there exists such serenity, a calm place in my mind to be reminded of myself.It's in that moment that all of the day's anxieties subside, all of the tension in my body melts, and the chatter in my brain fades to mute.In that stillness I find peace, for the briefest of moments, I am absolutely myself. Beyond all the nonsensical chit-chat, the problems I thought existed but were only in my mind, the facade of maintaining the image of 'me', and the collateral damage of having gone through another day as a human being with desires - beyond that there is more, beyond that is where I find myself, the real me.And just like that, there is a weight that lifts from my shoulders, and all I can do is chuckle within myself. I laugh in the same way you would after waking up from a vivid dream. I laugh because of how caught up I've gotten, in everything that doesn't matter. Having realized that once again, I just laugh.I'd feel as if everything is somehow just as it should be, and if I'd just look at things a certain way, it would always be so.And then I take a deep breathe in, and like saying hello and goodbye to an old friend, I feel both happy and a pinch of something that is hard to put my finger on, like nostalgic sadness.For as good as now is, I'm already on my way somewhere else.That brief moment is one of many that makes me happy every day. Sex is also good.**TL;DR** Pot good. Pot make happy. Sex. Surviving a fall after reaching terminal velocity. Disclaimer:> Of course, the connection to Genghis Khan will never be a certainty unless his grave is found and his DNA could be extracted. I read your post, and 'this is just like... my [opinion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWdd6_ZxX8c), man' but what the fuck, who cares about this situation.Your father is going through the roughest point of his life, fuck everything else.Even if the fiance's story is true or false, I would absolutely not give 2 fucks right now, and I especially wouldn't put forth any significant effort to validate or invalidate her claims.Troubling yourself with this seems so insignificant to me, I just can't state enough how little attention I would give this. Just nod your head to everything she is saying, and go on with your day. If she is lying or what have you, it will become apparent soon enough.I would shut down everything irrelevant and just focus on your dad, your work, and your life. Fuuuuuuck everything else until this is resolved. Focus on your needs, which right now includes being there for *your* father.Sorry for the profanity, and I wish you and your father well. This is normally a good way to think about things, but in this case, if you read OP's post... she wouldn't. I would tell him if you feel guilty about it, which you should.This is someone you want to possibly spend the rest of your life with, yet a few months in you've already found yourself with a secret to take to the grave? If you were a stock broker and came to me with this proposition, I would laugh.Mistakes happen, but if you instantiate a lie like this, that early into a relationship, I'm certain it will come back to haunt you. It will shape you and your relationship, whether to realize it or not. You would never be able to honestly say you and your boyfriend are thoroughly open with each other.The good news is that you didn't sleep with him. If you tell your boyfriend, I would really polish up on the fact that nothing seriously compromising happened. Honestly, I would be thankful this guy wasn't more of a creep and try to force himself onto you. I mean going back to the hotel of an unfamiliar drunk girl with a boyfriend, is pretty sketchy behavior if you ask me, so it's not that far of a stretch.The the bad news is that you put yourself in a very compromising situation, and consequently this will potentially severely alter your boyfriend's trust in you. Cheating is about a compromise of trust, it's not just about sex. He trusts that you know better than to put yourself into a risky situation.I know you said alcohol was involved, but this guy sounds like he was all over you for the entire night. If I were you, I would have made the situation or lack of it very clear on the very first attempt at flirtation, and then gotten far away from him.What I most definitely would have *not* done is let him get into a cab with me back to the hotel I was staying at. Say this out loud, it just sounds bad. At that point I would have said, with no remorse, to "get the fuck out," regardless of how much alcohol I've had, it would have been a no brainer that deep into him chasing you.But of course, mistakes happen, and alcohol happens. Will this fuck your boyfriend up? Probably for a little bit, but use it as a way to build a stronger relationship with him. On a personal level, use the experience to deal with similar situations better in the future. You know when someone is trying to be more than friendly. You know you shouldn't let them linger. You know you shouldn't have to tell them 'no' multiple times. You sure as hell should know you should absolutely never be alone with them in your private area.Foresight is often learned quickest through experience. Can boys and girls be friends? Sure, but foresight teaches everyone, eventually, that sometimes boys+alcohol=fuck, girls+alcohol=shit, girls+boys+alcohol=fucking shit. You gotta know the difference between the normal nights and the fucking shit nights.It'll be hard, but doing the right thing usually is. [So... what did I just read?](http://netrunner-mag.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/rage-face.jpg) By the time I began my junior year of high school I had already moved out of my parents' home, and lived in another state.I was 17 and had my phone confiscated from me. It was the very beginning of the year, and the principal told me that they would hold on to it for the remainder of the year.I explained that I did not live with my parents, and did not have a home phone. The cell phone was my only reliable means of contact, and I had just bought the phone.Nonetheless, the administration remained steadfast in their disciplinary recourse. It was simply a *concrete rule* that would not be avoided.What did I do? being 17 and under age, I forged documents confirming my requests to drop out. I then forged documents in order to enroll in a neighboring high school.I did all this without an adult ever being involved. I demanded my phone back, and ended up going to a much better high school.As far as other people? Well until 1824 the general rule was that it was impossible for blind people to read. Then Louise Braille came along and recreated the alphabet in a way that consisted of raised dots. That was pretty clever. **You can't** (in a professional environment)I've come to realize that when people get to this level, they exhibit strange behavior like: completely ignoring what you say, they continue to talk after you have said literally nothing, and they may consistently tell you things you have absolutely no interest in knowing.You need to perform several 'feelers' to gauge how engraved this behavior is.1) Try not saying anything responsive the next time they go off on a story about how their cat caught a mouse last Christmas.-If they continue to talk and end the conversation with a look of satisfaction, then they have failed this test.2) Try literally walking away feigning interest in something else.-If they continue the story with the next closest person, or even worse, just continue talking to no one, then they have failed this test.3) Try disagreeing with everything she says that can be disagreed upon. Fuck, try disagreeing with facts.-If they continue to talk to you, they failed this test.4) Respond to their speech with something that makes little to no sense, and is completely irrelevant. *I'm on a paleo diet, but Bill Gates, I love presidential candidate.*- If they continue their conversation as if nothing happened, they failed this test.If they fail all of these tests, then there is no hope, and you should feel entitled to just walk away from future conversations. If they pass some of these tests, continue to do them, until they stop talking to you, or they fail the tests.Cheers. In the context of dating, I believe it is due to a psychological attempt at not making yourself appear like a fool. Your brain does this by over analyzing your words and actions before you do them, while you are doing them, and after you have done them.This anxious thought pattern introduces hesitation, and desynchronizes the simultaneous nature of thoughts and actions - resulting in that feeling of foolishness, awkwardness, and the general feeling of not being yourself.It is as if you were to suddenly become aware of your breathing, blinking, and walking.These processes happen naturally in of themselves; autonomously, and you can maintain them effortlessly. However, if you suddenly put conscious effort into these processes, you are far more likely to make a mistake, like trip over your own feet.But again, in the context you are interested in, it happens because you are perceiving someone to be important, and like all things important, you are trying, more so than usual, to not make a mistake. In doing so, you are more likely to make a mistake, like come across as a nervous wreck.How do you mitigate this effect? Alcohol. At least until the next morning. ^^Don't ^^listen ^^to ^^this ^^advice.Cheers.

His stories will make you feel clean as a bucket of bleach.He has a story where he loses a few million at a casino, is taken to a private room in the hidden chambers of the casino, and is offered to bone like 10-20 high end escorts. He decides to go down the whole row...Yeah... I'm telling you, you will feel very clean after listening to a few minutes of that guy's life. What about it is making you feel so awful? Do you feel dirty? I personally don't believe prostitution is wrong, although there is obviously a common stigma, or taboo regarding it.The only reason I say I don't recommend it, is that most people feel how you are feeling now immediately afterwards, at least here on Reddit. Also, most people don't forget the first person they had sex with. Haha. I feel like this story pops on Reddit weekly.A lot of virgins experience what is called performance anxiety. Due to nervousness, you have difficulty reaching orgasm.But yeah, I'd never recommend anyone losing it to an escort, but if you already have, it's really not that big of a deal.This will be a forgotten memory once you get to like... 12(hopefully not escorts) give or take depending on how shitty your memory is.

But in high school I got into a lot of trouble for refusing to have my phone confiscated for a year.I was put into a situation where I had to give up my phone for a year, which was impossible because I lived on my own, or I withdraw myself from the school, to legally take back my property.I ended up forging documents to drop out, and enrolled in a neighboring school. I was 17 at the time and living on my own.If you are smart and curious enough to hack into your middle school's network, you can always find a way to win on your terms. Just keep calm and play smart. It doesn't matter that they know. If they really know, why would they ask?It's the same if you are being questioned by a police officer. The reason you don't answer questions, even though everyone knows the answer, is to flex your right to not incriminate yourself.If you admit to what you've done, you just helped your school/the police make their case as easy as pie.Don't do their work for them, especially if there exists a possibility of getting charged with a crime.This is literally why we have the 5th amendment right to remain silent.Edit: The person who down voted this is an idiot.

About 10 seconds later my friend and I go in behind them.We see the guy, and he turns around looking anxious. He asks me if we know him.I say no, and he turns away and turns back and turns away.As there is no other direction to be going, we walk behind him.The next part I don't remember, but my friend says that he swung as he turned around and completely knocked me out.No argument, no anything. I had no idea he was intending to do that at all, which of course was why I wasn't bracing to eat a punch.The employees working there were convinced that I made that whole thing up, and I fell over just fooling around.I had no medical insurance, and my family was stuck with a medical bill exceeding $10k.I still have TMJ to this day, more than a decade later.

Haha yeah, I'd hope nobody would be silly enough.Physical hacking happens with like... government spies, and corporate espionage. That's about it. Which is also pretty hard to believe happens, but it does because the information is out there. It's very possible this is how Sony is repeatedly being infiltrated, and they can't seem to stop it. Could be a Korean guy in their janitor's closet as ridiculous as that sounds, haha. I mean if your 2 networks are completely separate, then yes, your wired network is more secure.Yeah, this method can be super fun but also super dangerous. This is the exact same method you would use to show some ridiculous picture when people type in, for example, 'facebook.com'. You could prank an entire university this way, and it might be funny. But you could also steal a dozen bank accounts using the same method :( Haha, oh dear. I have to chime in one more time. That is technically just 1 tippy toe step in the right direction.Your ethernet computer is connected to the same network your wireless computers are connected to.Once a hacker cracks the password of your wireless computer(in a few seconds), they can use that information to compromise your ethernet computer.Yeah, like /u/Unsmokedsalmon mentioned, it is really hard to believe stuff like this happens. But we are in the future man, and security is something that is becoming increasing important, and we all suck at it. Ask Sony.The most secure would be completely wired network. Even those can be hacked by physically plugging into the network. For example, a corporate banking building might use a completely wired network, but a hacker might use social engineering to get past security, and literally plug his laptop into the wall. Yeah, for regular every day people *man in the middle* attacks can be impossible to spot. You might experience unusual load times for websites, but nothing too out of the ordinary. You might also see SSL security warnings for secure websites like banks, but these are often ignored by people.The only way I would imagine a regular person identifying it, is to be familiar with what devices connect to your router. In your router page(192.168.1.1 probably) you should find a history of connected devices.If this history is shows any unknown devices, you are probably experiencing, or have experienced this type of attack. Also, if your history is completely clear, then that is also evidence of someone cleaning their tracks.Or if your bank accounts are suddenly empty, and you have not recently gotten divorced, you may have experienced this attack. The length of password doesn't matter anymore. The program that most non-pro hackers use can crack any length password in seconds. It is flaws in the design that makes it this way.WEP is the oldest, and most unsecure, thus they made WPA. Now, WPA is unsecure, and something else will come along. So on, and so on. Security is in progression.So the only thing you can really do is to double check your router settings and make sure you are not using WEP. > wouldn't the driver need to know the wifi password?These days most people use 2 types of encryption on their routers. WEP(40bit / 104bit passwords), and WPA(128bit).There exist public, and open source programs that can crack these password in seconds. This has been done for over a decade. I won't mention the names of the programs, but everyone knows them, and a quick google search will show you how to use them.> how is he getting pussy to open her legs for his virusIn the article linked by /u/Unsmokedsalmon, the transmitter they use is the direct contact.They might place a chip on a seemingly normal USB cable, but that chip will install viruses directly through the USB port, and eventually grant access to that computer, which in turn will eventually grant access to the entire network.The only reason you would need to do this, is if your network is physically unreachable. For example, a nuclear plant underground in Iran. It might not have a wireless network, which would mean you would physically have to be wired up. Or it might be too far underground for antennas to reach for a hacker to breach. Or if you want data from a computer that is not connected to any network. Just to clear up some of the information being thrown at you.The type of infiltration that /u/UnsmokedSalmon is referring to, is called *man in the middle* attacks.You technically don't need any transmitter, and anyone could and does do this type of attack with just a laptop. The only requirement is that you need to be in close proximity to your target network.Wifi data is over the air for anyone to record, but you typically don't need to worry about that, because it is encrypted. These days all data is encrypted using a 40bit or 104bit static(doesn't change) encryption key, or a 128bit dynamic(changes constantly) key.If you know the wifi password, you will decrypt this information.The reason why hackers might use a transmitter is to directly infect 1 computer that already knows the password of the network you are trying to hack. So by installing a virus onto that 1 computer, you can figure out the password, and thus compromise the entire network much faster. But again, this is not necessary. The NSA can do this without going into your home and installing a transmitter, and so can anyone.There exists an activity called *war driving* where people do just this. They drive around with a laptop and a high end antenna, and put their laptop in between you and whatever website you were accessing, say your bank website. To you, nothing looks different, but all your information may be recorded. These are called adhoc networks, windows has this feature built into it. You can transfer files this way.This is in essence the wireless equivalent of what is called a cross over ethernet cable. I manage an eBay account and an Amazon account that average approximately $60k/month.Amazon is known for being stricter than eBay, and unfortunately, both are known for having gigantic pit falls for sellers.For example, with both companies, it is well known that transactions processed through PayPal give the customer the option to file a chargeback claim.Upon such an event, the process takes 1-3 months, and in the meanwhile the funds are taken from your account and given to the customer.This becomes a problem amongst fraudulent purchases, because it becomes impossibly difficult to prove your case with eBay/Amazon, because they aim for customer satisfaction.For example, I could order virtually any item off of eBay, and receive it perfectly as described.If the seller did not opt to have a signature taken upon delivery, I could just claim that I never received the item, and thus keep the item and get my money back.If they did, I could find a similar looking item, smash it up, and claim that it came broken. The seller would then be required to refund the money, and file a claim with the shipping company, with a very low chance of recovering any funds.Even if the item that arrived  'broken' was blatantly an attempt at fraud, a seller would have a very hard time proving it in any relevant way. And in the meanwhile, through a chargeback, the customer would get their money back. Paypal has a difficult time retrieving funds from banks in situations such as these.If you google stories of sellers on Amazon, you will find an infinite supply of horror stories, just like yours. They shut down accounts with out warning, they ban all accounts associated with your account, and they are notorious for denying appeals for seemingly no reason.Long story short, sellers get fucked over, and it is no problem because there are many others to take your place.The only way to survive selling online through these revenues is to keep sight of the bigger picture, which is profit.You can't afford to get caught up with that 1 person trying to screw you over, you need to accept that you are getting fucked, and move on as quickly as possible, and never get mad. *Plot twist:* The cop took all your books, your money, and your holiday spirit.Seriously though, what dicks.

Reasons to buy bitcoins:-Bitcoin is the most promising, and original crytocurrency-Bitcoin's price is currently low(~$400) in respect to last year's high of ~$1,000-Bitcoin has endured several large set backs, which shows its survivability-The minimal transaction costs and decentralization appeals to consumers and investorsWhy not to buy bitcoins:-Volatile(Can be good)-If you plan to actually use bit coins, the current applications are limited and/or inconvenient relative to traditional payment networksThe excerpt from [this article](http://www.vox.com/2014/9/5/6086171/why-im-investing-in-bitcoins) explains what investors are expecting to happen with bitcoins:> Open technology platforms are often fertile soil for technological innovation. A quarter century ago, many people dismissed the internet as an impractical toy for computer nerds. They saw centralized online services such as AOL and Compuserve as superior. And in many ways they were. But the internet's critics didn't understand the power of a computer network where anyone was free to innovate. People invented things like the World Wide Web, Google, YouTube, and Facebook, vastly increasing the internet's appeal.> Bitcoin optimists — and I'm one of them — think something similar will happen in the electronic payment market. They predict that a faster pace of innovation in the Bitcoin ecosystem will eventually allow Bitcoin-based payment services to outcompete conventional payment technologies. I don't think anyone is saying that. I don't think anyone is outraged neither, the author didn't come across as outraged to me. Mathers. I always leave them on. That's pretty awesome. I personally find recounting stories involving psychedelics never lives up to the experience. The experience is largely qualia, even amongst the people that were there with you.I can quickly recap the events of one scene in one night, but again, it's the perception of the experience that is memorable, and not quite just the facts of what happened.I find that the even the slightest intense situations can be incredibly dramatic, which eventually entails a feeling of relief, similar to waking up from a dream.I was already well into several layers of a trip with 3 other friends(A,B,C). We had wandered around the strange 'wilderness' of the neighborhood for several life times, but had now returned into the confines of the box we called a basement.My friend, A, turned to me with a deranged look in his eyes with one pupil larger than the other. Just as my futile attempts at rolling a blunt were becoming apparent. He turned to me and asked, "Are we going to *the end*?" *The end of what?* I asked. He replied, "*I don't know*," as he slowly faded into the shadows of the stairwell.Somewhere in my mind I knew he was going upstairs, and I knew I had to do something because he had a car, and his car keys. I often have incredible empathy while tripping, and previously in the night I knew something was going to happen to my other friend, B, who had already experienced a seizure and was trying to sleep.I felt the same way again, something was wrong. I had to act, and now. Years past, and I sat there collecting dust and growing mold.I explained to my friend, C, the situation, and he understood that we had to do something. Neither of us could figure out how to get the *fuck* up. Especially considering he was preoccupied trying to eat his phone.By the time we made it upstairs, I felt the breeze of an open door. *We were too late.*We pushed through the barrier between light and dark, and went into the shadows. I felt the mud, foliage, and rocks beneath my feet as I took each step into the void.To our mutual surprise, our friend A had not yet left. He was sitting in his vehicle staring into the abyss with his light on.My friend C and I surrounded both sides of his vehicle and pleaded with him not to drive. Our compelling arguments included the fact that we were in the depth of all that was known, and if we lost each other now, we would never find each other again.His rebuttal, in Raoul Duke fashion, was in essence that we were in bat country, and this was no place to be.Our perception of time was severely distorted at this point because by the time I began speaking again, I was speaking to fading tail lights. *We failed.*Panic set in, and I suggest all sorts of ideas to my friend C, including calling the president to put out an APB.In the midst of telling each other what we had to do, I noticed my toe was bleeding over my foot. *^Had ^he ^run ^over ^my ^foot?**More panic.* I bent over in such a way that I could count my toes. *1, 2... 1... 1... 6 ^^^fuck.* I convinced myself that if I had in fact lost a toe, I would be bleeding much more. I momentarily started laughing at the fact that I couldn't count to 5. ^^If ^^I ^^still ^^had ^^that ^^many ^^toes ^^left.Without realizing, my friend C, mentioned to me that were too late, an hour had passed, A was gone, and we had to return to the safety of the indoor castle.I reluctantly agreed as I lifted my head for the first time in that hour, bringing about all sorts of new feelings. Before I could express those feelings, I noticed something critical. Our friend A had in fact only drove about 50 feet to the stop sign, and was just sitting there with his 4 ways on. *Another chance for bat country.*As we approached his vehicle, he took off. *A was.... gone.* ^^^Goodbye ^^^friend.After returning inside, I dismissed all expectations of life and the Universe. We continued the movie Angel Heart, and I sat with a outward smile, but inwardly  in horror of Robert De Niro with 4 eyes on his forehead.Hours past, and we heard B's phone ringing. It was our recently lost friend A, he woke up in a parking lot with no recollection of how he got there.It took him over an hour to get back, but he does make it. I end up eventually being able to count my toes, they were all there but bloody.We go to a diner, muddy, bloody, and eyes still dilated the size of quarters. Amongst people getting ready for their work day, we sat there discussing the epic saga of nothing we had just experienced. *The end.*In another story, while tripping, we were the last people to see our pot dealer moments before he was shot. Every time I do mushrooms. Your HP Envy 6 has an AMD Radeon HD 7670M video card.This means you should definitely be able to use the display for videos no problem, but games may be an issue and require turning down graphics settings. Holy fuck, that third picture reminded me of Oberyn Martell. North Korea didn't want the movie released at all. I feel like if Sony is still planning to release the film, they might as well release it in all its glory.It's not like Kim Jong Un is going to watch the movie, and say *FUCK THESE GOD DAAAAMN DONKEY CUUUUU.... oh never mind, they toned down the scenes where they try to murder me. I'll let this one slide.* I feel like that was a spoiler.Edit: They edited their article, but it still sorta is. I said *in the author's frame of mind.* The author wrote an article discussing a situation in which a man asked her how she felt about being the first black woman he had been with. My response was in that context.I explained how it is objectifying from my point of view. It is the sum of a multitude of factors that leads you to have sex with someone, not just a single trait. It is how you word your thoughts that potentially leads to objectifying.Referring to my last reply - imagine the hypothetical inner dialogue of the Ferrari:*Wow, did this person just say this is the first time he's driven a Ferrari?**I thought I was just a nice car, but now I'm thinking they're just driving me because I'm a Ferrari.**Does this person even see me for the car I am? Or is it just the price tag and the name?*And like I said, if given the opportunity, I would drive a Ferrari just because I've never driven a Ferrari before.But if I sleep with a woman just because she is black, and I've never been with a black woman before, well that is objectifying. So the statement, "You're the first black woman I've been with," potentially draws the same objectifying conclusion.This is just how I think. It's not that you can't express your attraction to someone by commenting on their specific features. It's when you objectify someone based on those features.If I were given the opportunity to drive a Ferrari, I would do it most likely because I've never driven a Ferrari before. I might think and say, "Wow, this is the first time I've driven a Ferrari."But if you apply this type of objectifying observation onto people, it can induce negative thoughts like:*Is this person sleeping with me because of my race?**Should I be offended?**Is this person only into me because of _______?*In my mind, there are miles between saying, "I love your wonderful red hair," and saying, "You're the first redhead I've been with."Yes, when we look for sexual partners we all have things we like. But with the latter statement, there exist inherent implications that can be drawn negatively. *You're the first* carries an implication of comparing your partner to all past partners based on a physical trait, like the Ferrari. This is the objectifying line of thinking that, if expressed, can create negative thoughts, as written about anecdotally by the author in OP's post. So are you, just not with.....^^humans ^^O.O Man, that sucks for sure, but you gotta imagine that hearing that was the least of your Dad's concerns.People say derpy stuff all the time, because we are really good at not thinking before speaking.Stuff like this becomes things we tend to ruminate over, but ruminating is very unhealthy. Just accept it for what it is, a simply ill timed comment.Have you see the movie [Norman?](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1247683/) Like 10 years ago when cracks were more hit and miss, I remember there being a program called Date Cracker 2000.This program functioned as an application launcher, and solved the issue you are referencing.But yeah... these days just download the cracked version and save yourself the headache. Relief.From small things like finally getting to poop, to knowing that you and your friends are alive after tripping on mushrooms for the past 8 hours.Relief. Title should read "How to *legally* use Adobe Photoshop and other Adobe products indefinitely for free"Anyone who knows how to download torrents would never accept this as a solution. Super cliche, but I like John Donne's "No Man is an Island."*No man is an island,**Entire of itself,**Every man is a piece of the continent,**A part of the main.**If a clod be washed away by the sea,**Europe is the less.**As well as if a promontory were.**As well as if a manor of thy friend's**Or of thine own were:**Any man's death diminishes me,**Because I am involved in mankind,**And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;**It tolls for thee.* I've always liked this one:*Roses are red**Violets are blue**I have a gun**Get in the van* Nice, man. You were equally as dumb, if not dumber than I was. At least we're alive.^^^^^or ^^^^^are ^^^^^we? Whaaaat! 3!?!?! That's ridiculous. I would feel so unsafe around you haha.Cheers, this next rip goes out to you. I almost knocked my bong over when you hit me with the *motherfucker I'm Korean* hahaha Well, like I said, I wasn't ever offended.I just understand how it could easily be taken offensively.I agree that making that connection in your own mind, wouldn't be an uncommon thought.But by utilizing empathy, I, personally, would just keep that thought to myself. Which is exactly how I chose to conduct myself.Often times I have the thought of punching my boss in the face. But should I choose to express that thought more often just because I'm having it, I would need a new job. Well, for me, I wasn't ever genuinely offended.However, in the anecdotal article that was linked in OP's post, the author is offended at the prospect of having her life chalked up to someone's 'sex-to-do list'.> It feels like you are going to tell all your friends that you "bagged a black girl" last night.I can totally imagine that happening. I can even think of references in movies that include this theme. I like the movie *The Wackness*. An older character recommends to the main character that he, "should try to get with a black girl," because he never had the chance.And to answer your question in the author's frame of mind, I would take it offensively if the implication was there that being a redhead was remotely a factor in sleeping with them. I think by mentioning race in the way it was brought up in the article, the implication is easily established. So it's just not a good idea to say that.To put it another way, I would be very inclined to compliment someone's hair, but I would be sure not to frame it in the context of them being the first person with ______ feature that I slept with/dated. 3 friends, 2 white and 1 black, were kidnapped by cannibals.The Cannibal King hated vegetables so much that he asked each kidnapped man to bring him 10 of their favorite fruit.The first white man came back with 10 apples. The King demanded he shove them up his ass without making any noise, otherwise the King would kill him. The man screamed, and the King killed him.The second white man came back with 10 grapes. The king demanded the same from him. The man successfully inserted 1 into his ass, then 2, and then 3. After the 9th grape, he began laughing. The King immediately killed him.After waking up in Hell, the first friend asked the second white man, "Why did you laugh? You almost made it!"He replied, "I saw Mike, and guess what his favorite fruit was? **Watermelon!**" Nope. I've never even thought about asking. I'm normally too preoccupied in the delight of knowing someone liked me enough to make sexy time. x.x Ghz refers to a CPU's clock speed, or how many instructions it can perform in a second. The higher this number, the faster your CPU is.Applications use RAM to temporarily store data. If you use resource intensive programs, you can potentially run out of memory, causing the system to stall. These days 4-8GB of memory is typical.The GPU(graphics processing unit) is responsible for high level graphics rendering. GPU's are specialized to do a lot of number crunching, as this is required for graphics.Architecturally, CPU's have several cores that can handle threads from several applications. GPU's have hundreds of cores that can handle thousands of threads simultaneously, to crunch the numbers that render the graphics on your screen.In modern times, GPU processing is becoming increasingly popular. This is when programs utilize the processing power of your GPU, in unison with the processing power of your CPU.Generally speaking, all specs refer to how much of something a piece of hardware can do, or how fast it can do it. As cool as I thought I was not even trying and passing, actually trying just out of principle to form good habits, would have been much, much cooler.And in respect to socializing, to be much more care free and less anxious. 99% of the people I met in high school had no bearing on my life a year later, it was more just practice. I'm still amazed at how many friends/coworkers lives I change by installing ad block.Also Ctrl+mouse wheel to zoom in on webpages the fly. (ctrl+0 to reset) I have two distinct memories of sticking metal objects into outlets.My sister used to have these journals with locks and little keys. I held a key in each hand and stuck it in the outlet.The other time I unraveled the wire of a notebook, and stuck both ends into the outlet.Looking bad, I was a pretty dumb kid. Sometimes I wonder if my life now is a tangent life, and I really died as a child. Donnie Darko. I have a very old school traditional Korean father. Yes, he beat me as a child, for some things I didn't even do. I believe he believed in preemptive beatings.One day in grade school I came home after a long day to see my father cleaning the bathroom. I could tell he was mad because he was cleaning... he doesn't clean.Before I could get a word in, the bathroom had become a symbol of the mess that was my life.I said only one thing, "Dad, you need to... *calm*... *down*."It was at that moment I knew, ^I. ^^*fucked.* ^^^*up*. Your idea seems fine, but I personally wouldn't have put that much thought into this. If I was part of your management, I would definitely put this in the 'very low priority' category. It seems to be a problem for you because you are uncomfortable, as a woman, having to constantly squeeze between what will most likely be two men.If I were in your shoes, I would be very wary of coming across as a liability.However, something about "I want to become upper-management and to make it a more welcoming place for women," doesn't sit right with me.You say that you don't know why women don't stick around, yet you strive to become upper-management partly due to the desire to make your work place more welcoming towards women. What does this even mean? This is revealing gender bias, and outside the scope of the higher professionalism expected of higher tier positions.If I were you, this is how I would go about assessing the situation. Firstly, I would realize that the situation at hand is most likely effecting just me, or a small number of employees. If I were to stop assessing here, I would still suggest the idea out of principle, because it is in fact bothering me, and I have solution to the problem.However, you said that your goal is to get into upper management. Knowing this, I would keep sight of my goal, and realize that with a higher position would come greater, inherent prerogative - including changing the location of the files.What would I do? Accomplish my goal of becoming upper management, and then just move the problematic files. Issue resolved. You trade time to mitigate or eliminate the risk of looking like a liability in the short term.Also, if you suggest the idea now, realistically all you stand to gain is comfort, but you stand to tarnish your perception for that comfort. A tip from my poker life comes to mind, *wait for a better spot* - meaning wait for a better situation to make yourself look good. I think the fascination isn't that we might be in the future simulating the past now, but that we one day will be doing just that. From ages 12-18 I never paid for a movie ticket at the theater I frequented with friends.I discovered one day that if I walked with enough confidence, and pretended to talk on my cell phone, nobody would make the effort to check if I had a ticket or not.Once I was past the ticket people, I would open one of the exits where my friends would be waiting.The most amount of people I've let in was 15. In that time I've brought in entire food orders from many places - sonics, apple bees, all fast food places. Once I went with 3 other friends, we killed one of those big 1.75L bottles of Evan Williams. Nobody remembers anything about to the movie, or how we made it home, but we woke up to all the chairs and tables knocked over.But after living in Florida, as a grown up, I got used to being able to order alcohol and good food at the theaters the easy way, paying for it. In the movie I referenced, you could invite other people into your world to help build it. I'm not sure what incentive you could offer them though haha. Make a new account? TIFU by reading 'TIFU by pretending to be a cat'How my brain feels. When I was young, I saw the movie What Dreams May Come. In that movie, Heaven was essentially just like this. Everyone was the architect of their own world. So this is the way I always hoped heaven to be.I could definitely be entertained by this indefinitely. [Alan Watts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21RwqnB8GrE)> You don't have to do anything, you don't have to go on living.> Life is spontaneous, purposeless. The Chinese word for nature is ziran(自然). Which means that which happens of itself. When the Chinese say life is purposeless, that is a compliment.> Haven't you done this? Haven't you gone on a walk with no particular purpose in mind.

Upon incoming confrontations, she would plan, and execute, a strategy of overreacting(to very genuine concerns) and somehow flip the argument onto him. This was in contrast to other times where she would be overly nice.He would fine traces of half deleted conversations, which always had an explanations of course. This eventually evolved into using different messaging apps like Tango, to continue conversations outside of texting/facebook.She spent many late nights out with "the girls."Pretty much if you suspect something, and you're not a paranoid person, there is probably a reason. Changes in daily patterns, conversations, emotions, or the lack of.I think Benjamin Franklin said it the best, "Three people can keep a secret if two are dead."Things like cheating are just bound to unravel, it's just a matter of time; the more perceptive you are, the less time it takes. Web developer here, nobody knows for sure how efficiently I spend my time, as long as things eventually get done 'on time'.My day goes like this:Check emails.Check Reddit as I think about what I will get for lunch.Order lunch.Convince myself to put off work until after lunch.

Each casino's requirements vary, but the general idea is to have a very good hand, and be beat by an even better hand. It happens once every ~30 days.I've seen this happen 3 times, and each time is pretty crazy just seeing how people react to winning 40k-100k more than they were expecting. One guy who won went and tipped every dealer at every poker table $500.Other than that, I've seen a poker player bust(take all his money) another player. As the loser was walking away, the winner made some snide remark. The loser turned around and said, "I'll see you in the parking lot."The floor and security were called to get him, not sure what happened afterwards. Pretty dumb thing to say though, haha. > There's no reason to be nice to someone who's being an asshole to you.At some point I would have definitely agreed with you, and there is definitely a point where conversation becomes harassment.But what I'm saying is just that, there ***is*** something to gain by not being an asshole *ever*.Toxic behavior brews more toxic behavior. What's worse? Someone hitting on you, and you turning them down, or someone hitting on you, and you becoming an asshole in order to turn them down, spoiling your mood for the rest of the day.I feel like, in any context, if an asshole makes you become an asshole, they win. What is that saying? Don't let people bring you down to their level, they'll beat you with experience?Just my opinion, and how I prefer to conduct myself through experience, but to each their own :) Cheeers. Oh, I see.Your line of thinking was innocent and nice, while his may have been manipulative.But I don't buy into all the 'don't be nice to these guys'. Look at it this way, assuming that you weren't ever seriously considering sleeping with this guy(pity sex?) - whether you were an asshole to him or not, after you made your disinterest clear, the result would have been the same(you going about your business, and him doing the same, supported by the fact that, that is exactly what happened).However, if you change your mentality to snap at people at the first sign of perceived 'negging', then you will quickly become jaded, which is a far worse consequence if you ask me because you introduce the possibility of misinterpreting someone's intentions for no real gain.I'm not saying this guy was or wasn't an asshole, I'm more concerned with you not becoming an asshole yourself.Just be careful and aware, as you should always be around strangers.Cheers! When a person says any of the following:*You would look really beautiful if you would change your hair color**You have an interesting face most people probably couldn't appreciate**I'm often attracted to the girls no one else is*That last one makes me cringe. That's not even close to a compliment, if you don't realize that - that's on you haha.But I honestly think you did the right thing. Even if he was a bigger asshole, there is no reason to be an asshole back. Just let him know, just like anyone else, that you are not interested.You already have a good attitude towards people who have enough courage to talk to you, don't spoil it over some stranger reciting lines.Cheers. When I was a teenager, my friend and I went into a small wooded area off of a busy road with 2 BB guns, lighter fluid, and a lighter.After lighting a log on fire, we were so mesmerized that we failed to notice the sounds of 3 fire trucks, 2 police SUVs, and 3 patrol cars behind us.After a trip to the police station, they gave me back my lighter and a fine, but kept the lighter fluid.I'm not sure what lesson they were trying to teach me by giving me back my lighter - so I stopped lighting logs on fire, and started smoking pot. Thanks coppers! I believe all negative thoughts root themselves in ignorance, or a lack of understanding.Knowing this, I would hope your friend meant that the victims coming forward now is dumb in a strictly logical/judicial sense - in that the statute of limitation is **far** past, meaning they don't stand to gain much, but they do stand to tear Bill Cosby's image and mental health down in his final years - which may very well be the objective.Also, in your original post it was already clear you were speaking from personal experience, which sucks and I'm sorry for that. But statistically, 0.075% of Americans are raped each year, and of that 0.075% only 1/3 of the crimes are committed by strangers.This strongly implies that the portrait of rape you laid out is statistically an extreme. In most cases the rapists are friends or acquaintances of the victim in a seemingly ordinary situation, and not  a stranger brutalizing and assaulting their victim.I personally believe one of the biggest contributors to victims not coming forward immediately(which is when you should, like before you even shower), is a sense of guilt. Why do victims feel guilty? In most cases I believe victims feel guilty for putting themselves in compromising situations.For example, Judy Huth, the person suing Bill Cosby currently, alleges that in 1977 she and a friend met Bill Cosby on a movie set. She told him her age, 15, and Bill Cosby invited them to a tennis club where they played a drinking game. Afterwards, they went to the Playboy mansion, where Bill Cosby allegedly sexually assaulted Judy Huth.Barbara Bowman, very well known as of late, willingly saw Bill Cosby after the initial rape, to be assaulted again. In a recent interview, when asked why she didn't stop giving fellatio to Bill Cosby, she replied pretty much saying she hadn't thought of it.In both cases, the victims put themselves in very compromising situations, which is where I believe the guilt comes from.Dave Chappelle, a comedian, does a bit about how old 15 really is - in reference to the R. Kelly's sexual assault victim. He jokes that when he was 15, whether or not to move out of the way of a guy peeing would have been the easiest decision of his life.Judy Huth drank underage, and went to the Playboy mansion. Barbara Bowman continued to see Bill Cosby after her alleged rape.**there is no excuse for rape**I'm just outlining where the feeling of guilt may come from, and why victims may not be so quick to claim their assault. > like if a drawer doesn't work right he tears it out of the wall. But most of the time he is happy. Hey man, these are awesome. You should try putting these on t-shirts and selling them. I'll buy one. Beautiful eyes. Whenever I post on gender related threads, I get downvoted into oblivion; nonetheless, here is my *opinion.*The quickest way to explain catcalling is this: it is a mating call. Many fucking animals do this, and we are one of those animals that exhibit this type of behavior.Mating calls are typically done by males to attract females. Sounds familiar, right? Does it work on most females? No. Does it work on some? Yes. Just like the fucking wild, go figure.Does it make females feel uncomfortable? Of course it does, that's why it doesn't work most of the time. Is it annoying and obnoxious? Yes. Will it ever stop? **No**.This is a gender biased behavior that is simply inevitable. No amount of donations, awareness, or any other futile attempt will cease the existence of catcalling.Knowing this, I would apply the same line of logic to this situation as I do to all situations that are inevitable. Firstly, I would stop complaining about the unavoidable(which doesn't mean I'm against the awareness of this behavior and the issues associated with it), and then I would create solutions that take into consideration the inevitability of the issue.An example situation that also has an inevitable problem is littering on subway tracks in New York. An infinite amount of people can complain, bitch, and moan about litter causing fires on the subway tracks - but it won't prevent it from happening.The effort is better spent creating solutions that adapt to the problem. If you can't stop littering completely, figure out how to make litter on tracks not as big of a problem.This line of logic doesn't mean I have all the answers, but it is how I would go about starting to figure out the right answers.**TL;DR** :  Spend less time complaining about the inevitable, and more time coming up with meaningful solutions. The principal of one of the middle schools I attended was arrested in 2007 for selling meth to an undercover police officer.Upon raiding the school to apprehend him, they found him in his office watching gay porn with dildos, a pipe(meth), and marked money on his desk.I only wish the police officers had those body cameras, so that the look on his face could be posted on Reddit.I also find odd pleasure in the thought that somebody had to deal with those dildos.[Article](http://articles.mcall.com/2007-03-01/news/3713233_1_acerra-main-drug-paraphernalia) I would place an indestructible, immoveable stone tablet on top of Mount Everest. The tablet would read - 'All those who find, shall become divine.' or maybe 'All that is known, will be shown.' Followed by a constantly changing set of coordinates.Humans would quickly discover this tablet, and realize that the coordinates are at the edge of the Universe, thus ever moving outwardly.I, God, would do this out of curiosity - could humans work together to accomplish the impossible?The secret plot twist would be - the journey to the edge of the Universe would have revealed to them all the secrets humans were longing to know; thus, the journey itself would be the path to divination or realistic omniscience. Reaching the edge of the Universe would just be symbolic of the realization that humans have always been what they longed to be.Cheers. It's going to get pretty bad in Africa. As predicted by the CDC, the world will experience an unprecedented number of cases - upwards of 1.4 million by January.Everywhere else will have isolated, manageable cases - mostly from health care workers, and travelers.Then in the coming year treatment will be available like the experimental medication that saved the lives of those two American doctors.All will be well. Well maybe not so much for Africans. [DONUTS](http://imgur.com/71Eq4up) Beautiful. Woody is a person who accidentally whipped his dick out in class, and was expelled for forcibly making a teacher give him a piggy back ride... he wouldn't have thought of a scam that elaborate. I have a good friend named Woody. Woody is a lot like Dave Chappelle's friend 'Chip'. In high school, if there was an award for most pot smoked, we would have easily won.Sometimes when we would get high, he would do this thing that made anyone in his car die of laughter.He would go to a burger king or any fast food place that had 2 windows, and accepted payments at the first window. He would then drive to the front of the line and wait for the person getting their food to pull away - all the mean while giggling like a little school girl.He would then slam it in reverse, and reverse all the way to the front window before the second car had a chance.Then he would open the mystery bag to see what kind of food he looted.On one particular occasion, he did this right after we ate inside. The man at the drive through said, "Wait... weren't you guys just in here?"Without missing a beat, Woody says, "Yes. I forgot to get food for my mother.""Oh, ok."*Dies laughing with a whopper in his mouth*This is why I believe fast food places no longer use the first window to accept payments. Woody. I believe psychedelics can be useful in gaining comfort outside of our normal perspective, but the well known philosopher, Alan Watts, talks about the pitfalls of relying on drugs.He describes how any insight gained while on drugs is obscure and fleeting. Which anyone who has taken psychedelics could easily agree with.In the moments during and shortly after a trip, there are indeed profound feelings to be had. But the failure to articulate such thoughts and feelings is a testament to its flimsiness.He goes on further to explain that the same insights can be gained through meditation, but with absolute clarity and articulation. It is the longer path to the same destination.There is value in clarity of thought. Cheers. This may be cliche, but I believe life is but a dream, and death is waking up.No matter how crazy our lives may be, I think upon death, we will have a good chuckle at realizing the life we just dreamed was just but one of many instances of being.On a more literal note, there is a movie called, [Enter The Void](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1191111/), that portrays what I believe the literal sense of dying may be like.However, unlike the movie implies, I think that upon death we will experience an instantaneous expansion of consciousness, a reunion of our true awoken 'self', before being reborn.There is quote I enjoy from the French philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin,"We are not human beings having a spiritual experience. We are spiritual beings having a human experience." I wouldn't call this my worst experience, maybe my luckiest. But, it was the only time I had a police officer draw a gun on me.The story starts the day before, several friend and I go to a party. After a very short while there, I noticed a guy that had previously knocked out my friend. By the time I noticed him, he was already bothering a girl I knew of.Foresight warned me that if I did not leave, a fight was inevitable. So I convinced my friends that we should leave, and the only reason they complied was because I drove there, and we were in the middle of bumblefuck nowhere.One friend in particular thought I was being irrational, and so I decided to make it up to him by driving over an hour away to get cheese steaks in Philly.By the time we get there, the sun is up. I've been drinking, smoking, and I was tired. This combination led me to blatantly blow a red light about 5 minutes from our destination.Moments prior to blowing this red light, I was just thinking that I was surprised I made it all the way here without being pulled over(I speed, and generally drive like an asshole).In the moment that I realized I was blowing a red light, I looked to my left, and in a 'such is life' fashion, I noticed a police car.Before I could even wish anything, I was pulled over. I immediately lit up a cigarette, as I always have one ready to mask other smells.This might have been effective if it weren't for the fact that I had just smoked half a joint just several minutes prior. It smelled dank.In typical stoner fashion, I roll down all my windows, because why not?Now that I had the smell situation dealt with as best as I could, I had another issue. The insurance card and registration were in the glove compartment, along with a jar filled with about an ounce of pot.I quickly instructed my friend to calmly open the glove compartment and retrieve the documentation.As soon as I had the documents on my lap, I looked to my left and saw a female officer with a gun pointed directly to my face. I'm not one to break my composure, but I did let out a, "whoa."So after shouting and waving the gun around for some time, she said the inevitable, "I smell something funny."I responded, "Well, I was just smoking a cigarette...""No, *MARIJUANA* funny."I replied, "Oh, no I don't know about that."The officer did typical cop scare tactics and demanded I confess to murder and robbing a bank, etc. etc.She asked, "So if I search you and your friends, I won't find *anything?*"Now, I wasn't sure if my friends had anything in their pockets, but I also knew that there was only one answer to this question."No you won't."Welp, she immediately instructed me to get out of my vehicle. I complied.She forced me to empty out the contents of my pockets onto the trunk of my car. I didn't hesitate for a second, as I felt that things were going pretty swell relative to having a gun in my face moments ago.Laid out on my trunk was: a lighter, a pack of camels, keys, and my wallet.She asks if those are cigarettes in the box."Yes.""Open them.""Sure."As I opened the box, before the sunlight could even hit the cigarettes, I remembered something that made the blood rush out of my face.I had put the remaining half joint in my cigarette pack, and forgotten until just then.I was already in the motion and it was too late. All of the cigarettes were black from the joint ash. To make matters worse, the half joint fell out onto my hand in plain view.I saw her eyes look directly at it, as I palmed it with a 'see?' gesture showing the blackened, dirty cigarettes."Ok. Get back in your vehicle."(Heart restarts)She then proceeded to do the same to my other 2 friends.I got off with a $150 ticket, drove 5 minutes, and ate the most expensive cheese steak of my life.But considering the circumstances, I was pretty content with the outcome. Smoked a joint on the way home.Cheers. When I was in grade school, I infected many teacher's computers with keyloggers with the intention of doing what you did - logging into their grading system.Unlike you, I didn't get caught.

I get what you are saying, but a photograph is fixed, static. Conversely, the Universe is in a state of entropy, constantly fluxing. Furthermore, the eye can't readily observe the difference in a single pixel change. This is comparable to our lack of understanding of the Universe, but as I said previously - just because we don't know now(can't see the difference), doesn't mean we never will.Any infinite number of variables could be attributed to my current state of affairs, but only few I know for certain.If the conditions were not met to form earth, I would not be typing this response.The correlation between events only becomes significant when observed, but on a long enough time line(which reality may provide), an infinite number of correlations will become significant in an exponential fashion.That's just my take on it though. Cheers. I wasn't assuming you were depressed.You are having trouble grasping our relevance in a Universe so unimaginably large. This is completely normal, and simply a natural limitation of our basic mind.How can we off-handedly comprehend infinity, when we have difficulty grasping relatively small finite numbers.Every single physical objects in the Universe, affects every other physical object in the Universe. It even alters time.Theoretically, some alien that is playing a game in the year 3040, might be altering space time for some human on earth in 1951.Just because you cannot see, hear, or remotely grasp the interconnectedness of all things, doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.In your example, all these planets that have exploded **did** change the Universe. Saying that the Universe is still the same, is just you failing to be aware of the infinite number of changes. But again, just because you don't see or understand it, doesn't mean it isn't real.In the same way our daily lives go, the consequences of every single action we make, echos out into the rest of our lives. Some of the major ones we take notice to, like breaking your arm, or taking a wrong turn and getting into a really bad accident. However, even the trivial decisions you made have effected your life.When Pythagoras, and others alike, first speculated that the earth was in fact round, it didn't matter that no one else on the planet saw the interconnectedness of reality that led them to that conclusion. However, it was revealed to be true nonetheless.We have countless examples of human discovery that can give you hope. Just because we can't grasp the Universe now, doesn't mean we can't *ever* grasp it all.For example, this coming year the large hadron collider will resume testing the higgs boson particle. The data that comes from this experiment will be the strongest evidence ever, to prove or disprove the multiverse theory. This will change every aspect of our understanding of the Universe.We would have never gotten to this point as a species, if we just threw our hands up claiming that the Universe was simply too vast.Cheers. The well known philosopher, Alan Watts, long preached of Buddhism philosophies."You are an aperture through which the universe is looking at and exploring itself. Through our eyes, the universe is perceiving itself. Through our ears, the universe is listening to its harmonies. We are the witnesses through which the universe becomes conscious of its glory, of its magnificence." -Alan WattsIn Buddhism, the self is an illusion. Separation is an illusion. The "I" in the quote above, refers to everything.We exist because the Universe needs us to exist. We are imperative in the grand design of the Universe. We would otherwise not exist at all.It's like asking if any single cell in our bodies, *really* matters. Of course, single cells die in our bodies every moment, but we also know just as easily, that we need these cells to even exist.We do matter, in fact we are crucial in the grand scheme of things. We are the eyes, the ears, the everything. Without us, the observers, there would *be* no Universe.Cheers. I would say that associating the idea of wishing someone good health, with the phrase 'bless you' makes the most sense.However, the problem for me is, I know my words won't effect any one's health. I also know that the follow conversation is all too common:Person #1 : *sneezes*Person #2 : Bless you.Person #1 : *silence*Person #2 : **YOU'RE WELCOME** *asshole*And because this is so common, I cannot exercise my conscious decision to refrain from saying that phrase, without being looked at like an asshole.Somebody blesses me, I am obligated to thank them, they are obligated to welcome me. If I break from this ocd-resembling behavior, I am the asshole.*Mind numbing.*I feel adamant that all people should examine the reasons as to why they say, or do anything. If someone who has examined why they say "bless you," should decide to continue saying it, I'd have to respect that. But in this same way, I feel that no one should overly impress their predispositions onto those around them, especially considering that other people from around the world may not have been predisposed to such behavior.Cheers. "I'm pretty sure..." This is what I mean, no one knows exactly why and where it originated. There are many theories and speculations, but there are no answers. The most encompassing answer might be that each culture began saying it for different reasons, but those exact reasons are unknown."...there isn't an actual real good reason for it, people just do it." - I consider this to be an example of mindless behavior. Tradition is no reason to keep doing something because everyone else is doing it.When I said I stopped saying it out of principle, what I meant was that I couldn't justify a logical reason in saying, "bless you," so I felt obligated to stop.I believe mindless behavior like this, might seem harmless, but this mindless tendency can, in other instances, be much more detrimental.For example, there are some groups in Africa that do not believe in the existence of the Ebola virus. Just because everyone around you says the same thing, and does the same thing, does not mean they are right.If people exist that refuse to reevaluate their predispositions, you end up with groups of people who, despite any amount of evidence, will refuse to believe a deadly virus exists.Cheers. I'm Korean, and live in America.Years ago I decided to stop saying 'bless you' and all variations of it. I decided to do this because I honestly had no reason as to why I was saying it, other than the fact that everyone else was.Once I became aware of this mindless behavior, I had to stop out of principle. It was then I noticed that no one knows the exact origin of the saying, and this led to the realization that most people I've asked don't immediately know why they say it.People where I live say 'bless you' and don't know why, because they've never thought about it. The curious part is, even though most people don't know why they say it, and no one knows the original reason behind it, people are quick to get offended in the absence of this saying.I was once explaining this to my Mother, and asked her if people in Korea say bless you. She told me they do not. My Father told me what he would say if he had to say it, but it roughly translated to, "May God's glory be with you."Cheers. Not being able to imagine your life in your 30s is a major factor, if not the biggest, in why you are failing out of college.You don't know what you want to be doing, therefore, you can't commit to the uncertain steps to get to where you don't know you are going.Nobody just asks  themselves, "Oh let's see what I'm going to be like at 35," and just have everything mapped out in their minds, and especially not as kid.It takes conscious effort to decide, and even with every conceivable detail mapped out, no one's life goes exactly according to plan.Your thoughts on suicide stem from the same root problem, a lack of imagination of what you want from your life. You can't figure out what you want, so you would rather die, or at least fancy the idea.This makes a lot more sense than the Universe trying to tell you that you are going to die young.Furthermore, if you live your life convinced you are going to die young, you will either knowingly, or unknowingly shape your plans accordingly. In other words, you will self-manifest whatever it is you think will happen, to varying degrees.Get into a calm state of mind, think clearly, and decide what it is you want. Whatever it is you decide you want, you don't owe an explanation to anybody.If you find yourself thinking of any more of these nonsensical, unproductive thoughts - don't get frustrated, just let the thoughts go just as they came.Cheers. I once read a comment to a similar post here on Reddit. I would proceed exactly along the lines detailed in this comment:[reddit comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2e63j4/redditors_who_have_caught_their_so_cheating_on/cjwgunw)Once you consider your son, this becomes a high stakes game. And unfortunately for you, the shock of betrayal may leave you unable to think clearly. But right now is when clarity is most imperative.You need to think straight and accept the circumstances, and take the most effective path of action to reach your goal, keeping your son.Sorry this happened to you, cheers. The quickest, and easiest way is to write a letter of complaint to whatever company you want. Most companies will send you free stuff as compensation.The longer, but more rewarding way, is to start making Youtube videos reviewing products. Once you get enough exposure, companies will send you their relevant stuff to review, or you can request this proposition to companies and use your online traffic as an incentive to agree.Cheers. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjPTacmAi3oThis is the exact set up I use. You need 3 or 4 6Volt batteries, and 2 aluminum pans, and wires with alligator clips. You add water(not too much), and place your hands in the water for 10 minutes. You should feel the shock right away. Switch the negative and positive wires, and repeat for another 10 minutes.As with any treatment, our bodies adapt. It is very possible that this will become less effective with frequent use. To combat this, people change the voltage, usually starting with 3 6v batteries, and going up to 4. People also change the length of treatment from say sets of 10 minutes, to 15-20 minutes. Some people use a power converter to draw power from outlets, instead of using batteries - however, I only recommend doing this if you know what you are doing because as little as 0.1 amps is lethal.It is recommended to do this every day for 1-2 weeks, and then about 2-3 times a week after you feel the effects.One thing to note though, if you have cuts on your hands or you pick at your fingers, you will feel intense constant pain from the electricity.it is best to keep your hands in perfect condition. If you get a cut on your hand you can use liquid bandaids, or Vaseline on the area to prevent pain.There is obviously no perfect solution. This is just one form of treatment you can try, that is relatively safe. Have you tried an iontophoresis set up?It requires the same level of committment that you need to apply drysol, but is arguably more effective, and doesn't involve chemicals.It's not known for certain why iontophersis works, or how. But it is thought to involve minerals in the water temporarily blocking or disabling sweat glands. Also, the polarity of our skin effects sweating.I also read an idea here on Reddit that I have not heard of before - playing with concrete to induce dry hands. I haven't yet tried this, but I imagine it could be effective. Although I haven't yet thoroughly researched possible dangers of doing this.One last thought is, since becoming hyper aware of my hypderhidrosis, it has become apparent to me that my body's hormone? cycles plays a role in the effectiveness of any treatment I'm doing at that time. I would be less aware of my body had I not become aware of my condition. There are times where it seems that no matter what I do, my mind and body are in a state that induce sweating. In this way, I have good days, good weeks, and sometimes good months - but with that comes the inevitable inverse scenario.Hyperhidrosis is really, really rough. The implications are many, the number of ways it effects daily life is just infuriating. There is simply too little known about this phenomenon, and it appears that only those who suffer from hyperhidrosis, are aware of its existence.Cheers. Years ago, like most teens, my friends and I were all about smoking pot. Well truth be told, I still smoke pot, but this is not the point.One night, me and my buddy met up as usual and were in immediate need of some marijuana.We hit up a guy we frequented quite regularly. My buddy knows this guy better than I do, but at this point, I've known him for some time, and he knew of me.We get the stuff and drive around while we smoke. 30 minutes later, we call him to get more, as we wanted to smoke more.Oddly enough he didn't pick up his phone. I thought it was odd because he was probably still playing Madden on his Xbox. Several calls later and we give up.When morning comes around we found out that 2 men were hiding upstairs, and within 30 minutes of us leaving, they came down. After a brief struggle, the 2 men shot and killed our friend/supplier.My assumption is that the 2 men were waiting for us to leave before coming down.Not quite a 'near' death experience, but my buddy and I very likely delayed this man's death with our presence, unfortunately, only by 30 minutes (They were caught soon after). Even more unfortunate, is that the man that was killed had an inconsequential amount of money in his possession, and about 1 ounce of marijuana - about $400 in value, max.Cheers. TL;DR - A guy I thought was my friend stole money that I had stashed for a family member. My other friend beat the shit out of him and stopped talking to him.Many years ago there was a guy, we'll call him Jerry, that was a mutual friend of many people I knew. I would run into him at parties, smoking(we smoked a lot), and random places like the movie theater.Anyways, I had known of him for a while so it got to the point where I would consider him not just someone I know of, but someone I knew for sure, and he knew me.One night, my very good friend, we'll call him Tom, said he was coming over to smoke, when he got to my house he told me 2 people were with him, one being Jerry.Long story short, Jerry found a stash of $500 that was for my family member.I didn't realize it was missing until it was needed, about a week later. Through the process of elimination, I realized that Jerry stole it when I went to the corner store. It was a sickening feeling, and I was pissed.I knew for sure Tom had no part in it, so I told him what I thought happened, and also told him I have zero proof.One night later, I get a call from Tom. He says, "It's done," and hangs up. We meet up to drink some beers and I knew right away what he did.Tom had known Jerry longer than he knew me, they were very close friends. Tom's hands were swollen and bloody, but his face was untouched. As we went to grab some beers, he said, "he couldn't touch me."I'm not the type of person to value money, I understand that character is invaluable.That night I learned Tom's true character, and I prevented myself from wasting a lot of time with Jerry. Also the other guy that was there also stopped talking to Jerry, and we became good friends as well.Well worth $500. As an Asian-American I agree with your understanding of this cross-cultural issue. Because of your first hand observations, your response is very well articulated.America does have a taboo in regards to talking about weight, and just like you said, nobody has explained this to foreigners.Cheers. Just a heads up. I used to use Drysol as well, years ago.I noticed that after about a year or less, there was a noticeable decline in effectiveness. It eventually got to the point where I stopped using Drysol.Our bodies adapt to things, and grow tolerance.Currently, I use a homemade iontophoresis set up - using 4 6v batteries, 2 aluminum pans, and tap water.This set up worked great in 2 states, however, in the state I'm living in now, this method has seems to have stopped working. I researched into this and my suspicion is that the tap water where I currently live, lacks the minerals needed to block the sweat glands.I've tried several different brands of water, but I have not yet found a winner.I hope Drysol keeps working for you, but I would anticipate the day that it starts to not work.Cheers. It is the cultural difference. I don't think that can be stated enough. In many Asian cultures saying these types of things are not thought of as inflicting emotional harm.It's something that is said lackadaisically, and meant to be taken with a grain of salt. Often times, weight is the first comment made about someone upon seeing them. Sort of like saying, "Hey! you look healthy(or not)."Koreans will say you need to eat more, and then right after dinner, claim how fat you are.I guarantee if you were in a non-Asian establishment, you would not have had 3 people comment on your arms.I totally understand how it would make you upset, and I do believe you have every reason to be - but just keep reminding yourself that in all probability they didn't mean anything harmful by it.To the outside world, most Americans are perceived as fat.Cheers. The usernames and passwords you won't get unless you keylog her computer but that is also illegal.I've used this software before with success - http://www.iphone-data-recovery.com/recover-sms-from-iphone.htmlThis software will allow you to recover texts and photos.But this will not work if the phone was reformatted/fully restored.Sorry that happened to you. Cheers. I was in a convenience store, and on my way out I witnessed this scene:A girl puts some stuff in her purse. The employee standing right in front of her says, "You did not just do that..."To which the girl replies, "No, I didn't. Well I did, but I didn't."To which the man just shook his head.Double standards. I'm still really sick but the doctors think that they finally know what is going on. I'm really glad about that. How are you? I'll see what I can do! Hello everyone! How goes the day? I'm sorry I've been gone-I've still been really sick. I've had to reduce stress on doctor's orders. I'm so happy to be back. How are you all? Well, you really can't go wrong with Princess Mononoke or Evangelion for that matter. Evangelion is just always a mindfuck.  http://imgur.com/a/duyqbI'll admit, while I've had stuff like this directed at me a hundred times, the lack of value of your fellow human makes me want to cry every time. Do not ever let them tell you that "no one just tells sick people to go die."People have told me for years that because it takes a lot of money to keep me alive, it's not worth it and I should just die already. It's *my* fault their premiums go through the roof because I'm sick with these conditions (none of which I caused!). I have heard this kind of thing since I was a kid (to my FACE!) and I'm now in my mid-twenties. Do not let them normalize this. Do not let them start putting price tags on lives.  Thank you so much! <3 Thanks! I've done some looking into it, but the whole thing can make your head spin with all the strains and the oil vs extract etc.  Gooo Texas A&M!Though it's just not the same this year. It was always something my grandpa and I shared, and he passed last March. A&M was his Alma Mater and it was just very special to him.  Thank you so much! <3  It is crap. It's complete crap. For so many Americans, they're going to go back to bankruptcies after what would be a simple medical procedure with insurance. It's a pay-to-play system that only the wealthy can afford. The R(s) won't be happy until everyone has NOTHING, and the weak (pre-existing conditions) are dead. <3 Thank you so much. I'm trying to make sure I've thanked everyone for the well wishes-it's very important to me to acknowledge this. :)  <3 Thank you so much. I'm trying to make sure I've gone back and thanked everyone, I really feel this is important to me.  Thank you so much <3 The outpouring of support was incredible. <3 I am not either but good people thinking good thoughts, I feel, is never a bad thing. Thank you for your well wishes! Thank you so much <3 I'm trying to make sure everyone gets acknowledged for your caring.  Thank you so much-I'm trying to make sure everyone gets thanked properly. <3 The support means the world to me. I have Specific Antibody Deficiency (i have a laundry list of things wrong with me)-it's a type of Primary Immune Deficiency. I actually developed Celiac Disease about 10 years back. No alcohol at all for me, and honestly, I don't even eat much of the bread/cracker/etc substitutes nowadays. My RSD/CRPS causes gastroparesis and I've found it's best to avoid them, as you said. Thank you for the well wishes-I hope you feel better too! They really did. The ACA was far than perfect, and I would be the first to argue that. But it is so, so much better than "pay up or die." Who is your team? <3 I think I made it through the worst of it. Thank you so much for the outpouring of support.  Thank you so much. <3 The outpouring of support from our community has been so generous and wonderful.  <3 It's a pretty bad, drug-resistant infection, but I will beat it, sure enough! :) I'm too stubborn not to. <3 Thank you so much-I am going back and trying to make sure everyone is thanked properly.  I am plugging along. <3 Thank you for the kindness and well wishes!  I'm going back and making sure each and every one of you get the recognition you deserve for being so kindhearted towards me. <3 Thank you so much. I am just really, really glad you guys have been happy with my work. <3 I am more than feeling the love. Our community is amazing. Thank you so much guys <3  I think my doctors would murder me if I added booze to the cocktail of meds I am on...but for the fiance? Absolutely. He's been amazing through all of this.  OOOH! I forgot GITS is coming out in theaters. I really want to go see Hidden Figures. Thank you so much-I'm trying to make sure I go back and thank everyone for the well wishes. <3 We are all still #StrongerTogether. I have no doubt in the strength and power and community. It's just also a very personal thing for me. I wrote EVERY congressmember a letter for the votes to enact it, and was tireless in my campaign calling my local people (I actually got a call right after it passed because I called so much from Al Franken's campaign. I broke down sobbing to the woman on the phone.) The thing is-The ACA passed and saved my life-I was two weeks from losing my insurance. I remember so vividly watching the two votes, and waiting for Franken to cast the final vote that decided it.All of the good, and it looks like it may just be destroyed with the wave of an arm, and "replaced" with the farce of HSAs and "pay your way." Which is impossible for anyone with conditions as severe as mine. My care runs in the mid 6 figures a year. Back during the ACAs debate, people were so worried about death panels. But that's EXACTLY what Trump and his brand of republicans are bringing about. Can't pay the price to live? Well, bye, Felicia. <3 I'm going back and trying to make sure I thank everyone who sent good thoughts my way. Thank you so much! Good evening everyone! How is Monday treating you? The ACA...this is just breaking my heart. <3 Thank you so much for the good thoughts. I was stunned by the outpouring of support from our wonderful community. Thank you so much-I am trying to go through today because I want to make sure each and every person gets thanked. I couldn't believe the outpouring of support I recieved. Thank you so, so much. I'm so sorry it took until now for me to catch up on thanking everyone, but you have no idea how much this meant to me. I'm going back and thanking everyone who had kind words to say-Thank you so, so much. <3  I am doing my best. I have a very good snuggle partner with my service dog. Unfortunately, she can also kind of try and squish me at times. :( That's horrible. Can people just stop shooting other people in general please? I don't care who they are, or why, just stop. <3 I am going back and thanking everyone who expressed kindness and love in my time of need. I appreciate it so, so much.  I'm going back and responding to everyone who sent me well wishes-Thank you so much <3 I am doing my best to! <3 It's been a very long couple weeks, but I'm hoping the upswing is here.  Thank you so much for the kindness and love! <3 Thank you so much. I try to be as open and honest with you guys as possible-but also try and keep identifying details secret. But I do feel it's important you know why I was away, and as much of the truth as possibly can be told. <3  Thank you so much! I am making the turtle climb to feeling better! :D <3 I am so glad to be back Bum, and to see your enthusiastic self again! Yeah...I was not pleased when I saw that and the sensitivities on it. I've done drug-resistant bacteria before, but this one was YIKES. To have so few options is a bit scary to me. Thank you! <3 I am glad to be back! Thank you so much! <3 I have been stunned by the outpouring of love and support. It means the world to me. I am taking good care of myself, but seem to have hit a point of "not getting better, not getting worse." My chest is congesting up again, but I have multiple doc appointments this week so we'll see. I've been calling like a madwoman. I just...guys, I honestly feel like my world is ending. I'm hoping that CA takes care of us, but I have no idea what I'll do after this year.  Hey guys- I'll likely be in and out every 1-3 days for the next week or two as I rest and recover. I'm not making huge gains, so I'll be headed back to the doctor to see what is up. I'm also just trying not to struggle with the emotions of wanting to scream, cry, throw things, and just plain give up after fighting so hard, and so long, and it's looking like the GOP is going to dismantle the ACA so easily. Everything I have fought for the last 8+ years...and then not knowing how and what the future holds after this year for me. The HSAs are a joke. I'm going to try and catch up with all of your kind messages today.  I love all of you <3  Thank you so much Bum! <3 I saw your PM-I am responding to all of them when I have time.  The overstuffed inbox I came back to attests to that! I cried on seeing that. I will be getting back to *EVERYONE* over the next couple days.  That's what the doctor's think-thank you for the well wishes. I'm hoping to be back up on my feet not too much longer. Wisconsin is a very good place. <3  Thank you so much! :)  You *should* be ok until the end of the year...and then we're totally fucked. I'm really trying not to think how my life will be measured in weeks after that. No-he said he was going back to his independent affiliation, however he was going to be working with the democrats. I'm just praying that: A) My insurance company will stick to their word of providing policies at the same price through the end of the year, and MAYBE they'll allow me to renew for the next 3 years. B) My insurance companies provide my policy until the end of the year, and California sets up it's own independent deal in 2018 with them with subsidies, etc and the protections for preexisting conditions that now exist.  Well, we can plan while I'm sick, that is for sure. :)  Thank you so much. I am doing my best to do so, and then I want to bring about big things for the subreddit. Thank you! I will be responding to every PM I got, my inbox is stuffed. <3 It just goes to show how wonderful our community really is. I'm glad that I can still be here and Keep Calm and Carry On for all of us. :)  I am so sorry I caused so much concern. I don't remember posting that much but I can see how it did! :( I'm hoping I'm on the up and up from here.  It's OK. I know that the real people of the sub care. <3 I really didn't mean to worry anyone, I've just been alternating between sleeping, very sick, and out of it.  God-I don't even remember writing that part, but I really want to know why I was so fixated on that. Lost in the depths of my mind, I guess. :D Thank you <3. Sorry I had to step away for a moment-It's actually my every three week infusion day of the antibodies that help my underlying immune deficiency. I should be here for the rest of the day unless I take a nap.  I can't say I'm surprised with the current Republican attitude towards women.  Hello everyone. I am so, so sorry for worrying all of you, but I have been very, very sick. I have been resting and trying to get to a spot where I am stable and I think I've finally reached that point. I'm going to try and lay it out without going into too much detail for my own privacy, as I'm sure you understand. I see that my post on 12/28 was not coherent. (Why the fuck was I so focused on the gingersnaps?)It turns out I am dealing with a rare drug resistant strain of staph. The severe infection caused lactic acid to build up which caused lactic acidosis-which caused confusion, etc. I'm still not quite completely clear of that yet, but we're working on it. My inbox is stuffed full of kind words and well wishes, and I came back crying to that when I logged in. I will be responding to each and every one of you as I go through them and clean up the sub. I love you guys. So much. <3 Thank you. For everything. I apologize if I mistype a word here and there. It should clear up in a week or two, and I have Grammarly installed to try and prevent it. -SDB Guys, it's gotten really, really bad and I'm not sure I'm going to be entirely conscious when I'm taken back. I lov your all and I will update when Ipossi can. Thank you for the well wish s the ginger snaps came out great btw. Ok guys, I'm at the ER due to loss/alteration of consciousness episodes, slurring of words, and seeing/hearing things I am so sick. While waiting to hand something to the nurse, I lost consciousness in the waiting room and hit my head on the waiting room, and am currently in a cervical collar and wheelchair combination awaiting my turn in a CT scan. Due to an absolutely packed ER they haven't been able to do anything but triage me and put me at the top of the line for a room when it becomes available. I'm not one to usually ask, but can you please keep me in your thoughts as I go through this and hopefully get the treatment I need? Because I'm normally rock steady when it comes to my medical issues and this has me kinda scared. :(  Hillary has nothing to be pardoned for. Despite everything going on, I am confident this will get tossed out again.  Boo. I hope tonight is infinitely more restful.  Well, that's not creepy at all.  Hmmm. I'll at least think about checking it out. I have last season's Worst Cooks in America and Kitchen Nightmares to catch up on first! :)  Awww! It's always nice to know that people look forward to seeing me around more. :)  Yep, it really is, which is why I haven't allowed myself to do any yet. I will be taking selective advantage of some sales in the coming weeks! It's weird to have a small amount of spending money. I feel guilty spending it on myself, I am just so used to going without and making sure everything else is taken care of first.  Oh, ok-I get your point now. :)  I think Trump is similarly awful in a lot of ways, but given the death tolls that Hitler caused, he still ranks higher. I do think Trump may be more arrogant than HItler due to the fact he has been handed everything in life, and that certainly affects his judgement. It reminds me of a spoiled toddler in so many ways. Hmm. I'll add it to the *consider watching* list. I will give you that the variables are all up in the air. I do however, think it was COMPLETELY unfair of Obama to come out and say this given those variables. There is no way of knowing, and saying so is quite frankly, just arrogant. Even when I took the context into account, I would have expected better of him, considering the racial inequality he had to soldier through in order to become president.  As a mod here, you have no idea how much it heartens me to hear this. That people ARE hearing her message and taking it to heart like this. <3  Yes- which is why we have big plans for the future! They however, involve BOTH subs remaining open. The fact is, people are here and came here because they were fans of HIllary, and she may play a big role in the next four years (or longer). But we will also be ramping up /r/pantsuitnation will be for activism after Jan 1st. It is available if people want to start submitting things now, or talking in the roundtables. :) /r/pantsuitnation will be ramping up after Jan 1st. It is available if people want to start submitting things now, or talking in the roundtables. :)  We actually *do* have one for activisim- /r/pantsuitnation. It is NOT affiliated with the FB group, just need to point that out. However, we're waiting to ramp things up there after Jan 1st. It is, however, open to our subscribers, has it's own roundtable, and everything right now! :) It will just be getting more focused attention after the 1st. Hello everyone! How goes the day? I should be here a lot more going forward. I appear to have permanently solved the kernel panic issue I had with my Macbook Air. To do that, I had to wipe and reset it to factory settings. The good news is-everything is in the cloud these days, and it took all of a few hours to get everything re-downloaded and set back up like I had before. I'm always amazed how far technology has come these days. :) Did anyone have anything of note happen today? Most of the moderators are pretty good about catching the bad ones. Please feel free to report as "Bad Source" if we miss one. We're not perfect by any means! It is PAST time to ditch this antiquated way of voting.  Just read the episode synopsis on that one to see if the show would be worth watching-does it get remarkably better from there, I assume? Finally, someone came out and said it. I don't think Obama would have beaten Trump had he somehow miraculously been eligible for a third term. The Russia smearing would still have been in play. The Russians don't like Obama any more than they like Hillary! Maybe even less so since he's the one who has actually been in power and making decisions on them for the past 8 years.  As much as I wish you didn't need to post this disclaimer, thank you for doing it. It saves us mods some work. :)  <3 Yes, yes we are!  I agree. Sometimes they just come in downvote swarms and there's nothing we can do. I apologize. :(  I'll put in the request to the head mod, but only after I deal with this mess.  Anyone receiving unsolicited PMs, please send screenshots through modmail. Harassing users of the subreddit through the PM system has a zero-tolerance policy and they WILL be permanently banned with no appeals. Jesus Christ. I had to do a hard reset on my computer to take care of the kernel panic once and for all, and I come back to chaos. Bear with me as I clean up the mess that the sub has become. Please, report all comments and posts that are out of line, any sitewide issues to this comment, and anything that needs to be dealt with by a moderator through modmail. I will crank through everything as quickly as possible to restore order. Yay! I hope you have a wonderful time. :)  You cannot go wrong with tacos!  Hahahaha- You're probably right. :) I love her to death though, and it's been an extremely productive morning as far as cleaning the apartment goes. So there's that!  Yes, I completely agree. I do not think ISIS is going away anytime soon, however.  Well, that isn't new. :/ I'm just so dissapointed they seem so set on normalizing this circus and not actual journalism. This isn't really relevant to the sub as a whole, but I found these two stories to be interesting reads this AM. It's fascinating to me how they can have such different perspectives on how the fight with ISIS is going (albeit in different geographical areas.) [Iraqui PM says 3 months needed to defeat ISIS](http://in.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-iraq-islamicstate-idINKBN14G16I)[Russia, Pakistan, China, warn of increased ISIS threat in Afghanistan](http://in.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-iraq-islamicstate-idINKBN14G16I) *fistbump of CA solidarity* At least, we hope not!  Good morning everyone! How is your Tuesday? The dog woke me up earlier than I intended to get up, but oh well. More time to spend with you guys and get a few other things done. :) Does anyone have any fun plans for New Year's Eve? Thank you so much for your well thought out comment and response. I really appreciate it. I really believe that the next four years are going to require ALL of us to come together to fight the common enemy in order to survive. All I really want to happen is for people to acknowledge that the biases *do* exist in some portions the communities. Because once they are acknowledged, people tend to get uncomfortable about them and the problem starts fixing itself due to people talking about it. Just an open dialogue amongst the supporters would be wonderful-I'm not expecting anyone to miraculously be free of any or all racial or sexual bias. I mean, most of us are guilty of some kind of bias on some level on a daily basis. As you said, we can only try and be aware of those biases and try and keep them from affecting our judgment.  Good evening everyone! I ended up crashing and having a long accidental nap this afternoon. I'm just plain worn out after the past few days. I'm not sure why, but the trolls have been increasing in PMs lately to me. I've been called a bitch (and worse) so many times in the past few days it's not even funny anymore.  I haven't seen any true bashing of Obama, however, I have seen some legitimate criticism for how he's handled some of the election mishaps, Russia, and a few of the things he's said about Hillary and the election in the past few weeks. No one is 100% perfect, and civil and legitimate criticism is allowed on the subreddit.   Finace works for an environmental nonprofit. :D  That's a complex answer-it's basically yes/no. The yes part is that it's true, even our largest bombs will not completely flatten most countries to smithereens. It depends on how many bombs you drop and what kind as to the total impact. However, you have to consider a few other things that they are NOT exaggerating on. The USA alone has more than enough nukes to obliterate the overwhelming majority of life on earth a few times over. Add in Russia's arsenal, and that increases. You also have to look at the longer term impacts than the initial blast casualties. There will be people dying of radiation exposure for weeks afterward and weather systems/patterns will spread that radiation over enormous swaths of land, poisoning it for years to come. There are also secondary casualties from things like radioactive rainstorms that follow a huge nuclear explosion. Then you have the dramatic increase in birth defects. Not to mention cancer rates amongst the general population that will impact people of all generations for a long, long time. It's a complex issue. One nuclear bomb, while obviously an enormous and horrendous loss of life *might* be recoverable from depending on the size of the bomb as well as the country. However, when you start speaking in multiples, it gets messy fast. Plus you have the enormous psychological impact of launching nuclear weapons in the first place, as well as potential retaliatory strikes that keep escalating. It's a very, very scary scenario and situation, especially with a man like Trump with the ultimate say. The inability of him to think of the complexity of the consequences is what makes it so terribly frightening, IMO.  What kind of shoes, if you don't mind me asking? What was on sale that you wanted? More black clothing? :)  I think that's reasonable. There are valid (and civil!) complaints to be had there. His campaigning is very one note. It's the same stump speech over. He also focuses too much on economic equality as being the main/only issue that matters and is the root of all evil. I would like to see him expand his message to include women's rights issues, as well as the rights of minorities and the disabled. Now, we have many wonderful contributors to this subreddit that are also Bernie supporters, so I want to make sure to stress this does not apply to all of them. However, a significant amount must to come to terms and acknowledge the fact that they have significant amounts of sexism and racist undertones that exist in their revolutionary movement. Including statements and ideas that have come from Bernie himself. There needs to be a push to change this. Both amongst the supporters that are actually sexist/racist, as well as his fans that are merely not speaking up against this or even acknowledging it exists. I also think there's a bit of a tendency to take things way too personally with some of his supporters. A refrain of NOT ALL OF US seems to be a pretty frequent response to comments that do not criticize all of his supporters but speak to general trends.I know I've taken to posting disclaimers when I talk about this subject (like I did here) to try and prevent that from happening, so civil discourse can continue with both parties having somewhat open minds about what is going in.   That is a wonderful and haunting documentary. Needs to be required viewing for every American during their high school or college years. <---Is a huge nuclear nerd Hmm-My fiance recommended that when I asked him. He's in IT. It opens a lot of doors with things like nonprofits, etc, if you want to have a job that also doubles as activism. YMMV, I guess. :)  Definitely more than a little.  I just saw a headline that reminded me. Did anyone else get a good laugh out of Trump's low-effort Christmas Tweet that was just a screenshot of a cheap-looking card? Yaaaaaas Queen! :D  Woo for combatting climate change and infant/toddler mortality rates! :D *dies a little inside* It really strikes me in hindsight: This Election was turned into what amounts as a reality TV show. I really, really hope that this does not spell the future of American elections and politics as a whole. The Presidency isn't a contest of who can be most entertaining. It's based on who could do the best job of meeting the needs of the country.  Of course I'll mention you. I believe in giving credit where credit is due. :) Since I didn't have the original idea, it would be unfair of me to claim it as my own.  So do I have your consent to do so? I want to make sure it's ok with you. :)  I will point out that /r/pantsuitnation has no affiliation with the FB group, just as a disclosure. However, we have some big plans for it. It's ok! :)  It's been a pretty good year for space tech!  The Mitochondrial DNA transfer system is so huge-I'm not sure people quite recognize that this has the potential to open doors for a LOT of treatments for diseases.  That's also an excellent one! I was so, so excited about that.  Click the blue link in my post above. :)  Dude, this is kind of a really unsensitive comment. While yes, *ideally* everyone should have an emergency fund, with the reality of the economy and today's job market that's just simply not possible for a LOT of people.  You can get screens for cheap on Ebay if you have a phone/computer savvy friend who can do the install for you. One of my friends does this fairly regularly for friends who break their screens.  Honestly-a major in Computer Science with a minor in Marketing would probably make you a lot more versatile, as well as more attractive to companies as a well rounded candidate. If I was in your shoes, that's what I would probably do. Congrats on the almost-degree! That's a huge accomplishment. :)  I was as well-I thought this was at least ONE area he would have been developing a concrete plan on, as it was one of his main selling points to his supporters that seemed to resonate. Even though all of his talk of indiscrimanatory killing was sickening. WHAT?!??!? ~~I'm sorry, that's just sickening. The Democratic politicians that are throwing Hillary under the bus ought to be ashamed of themselves. Hillary has been in the game and fighting for Dems for longer than most of them have been in politics!~~EDIT: Ok-I've had a chance to look at the context of this, and Obama's major disagreement was in strategy. Not *quite* throwing her under the bus. That's more on her campaign advisers than anything. He still praised Hillary for being wonderful and that she was not treated fairly by the media. The only thing I'm unhappy about is he fails to address the part *he* played in all of this.  You and me and pretty much everyone in this subreddit, my friend. <3  Good morning everyone! I hope you are doing excellently! I'm for some reason particularly hating Monday and the return to adulting after two days of break. I didn't realize how absolutely strung thin I was and stressed out until I allowed myself to not worry for a couple days about all the stuff I have to get in line for the end of the year. Oh well, back to tackling everything with gusto! Did everyone have a good Christmas/Hannukah/Other Holidays? Generally, SSA considers any sort of savings-stocks/bonds/savings accounts, etc, as part of your assets. They're pretty strict with that so the system does not get overwhelmed. You are not being discriminated against (in this case, at least.) I can't say if you haven't been discriminated against legally otherwise, of course. Absolutely not. You must understand that (through no fault of your own), your skin makes it a *huge* risk for the tattoo artist to tattoo you due to the bacteria, etc that exist in those cysts/acne. It's a health risk with the great possibility of bacterial transmission as well as any other diseases that live in body fluids like HIV, etc. Not to mention they are probably violating their licenses and opening them up to nasty lawsuits when something almost certainly goes wrong. Some people just can't get tattoos.  Also-if you answer "No" on the renewal section of your driver's licence application that asks if you have any conditions or medications that impair your ability to drive and they find out, you're eligible to lose your license (and/or get charged with a crime).  A point- Every pain doctor I know of (which you almost ALWAYS have to be in a program/with a doctor for that kind of regimen), makes you sign a statement that you will not drive if you are on narcotic pain medication management. Doing so violates your contract with them/the treatment clinic and right to get those drugs. This is due to cases like this where people accustomed to the noticeable side effects (usually long term users) *think* they are fine but they are not. The thing is, no matter how you feel, or how you *think* you are impaired, legally, what you are doing is against the law. Period. You forefight the right to drive when you commit to daily management with narcotic pain meds (and other meds that can alter your reflexes/responsiveness).  This-a pharmacist can provide you with correctly labeled small bottles /vials so you can carry one day's worth. Never lie to the police. Either tell the truth, or refuse to answer without an attourney. However-EITHER of those will end up with you arrested because what you are doing is against the law. [If you'd like, please come participate in our (hopefully annual) post, the Best Positive News Stories of 2016. It's a tribute to the America that we believe in, and that Hillary loves and fought for each and every one of us.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hillaryclinton/comments/5kcsrl/rhillaryclinton_presents_the_best_positive_news/) <3 I'm glad we still bring some joy and happiness. You're welcome-I do it willingly and gladly. This place has become my home on the internet, and I care about the people who come into it. I offer hugs. <3 We personally can't afford to go anywhere-and my medical situation and care wouldn't allow me to. (I'm travel restricted to the 50 states and Canada as it is.) I hope that as many as possible are able if it gets truly dark in this country-but I am trying to hope for the best.   <3 I am thankful you at least check in to let us know that you are safe and OK. I know that I really appreciate it. I have a list of regulars that I've been hoping would at least check back in (most said they were taking a break until the electoral vote). I know we're just moderators of the sub on the internet, but we do deeply care about all of you. <3#Not targeting you, but I'm going to take this opportunity to leave this here for anyone who may need it this holiday season and into the New Unknown with Trump looming: 1-800-273-8255. The number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. There is also a online [crisis chat](http://chat.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/GetHelp/LifelineChat.aspx) for people who don't feel like talking on the phone. We've been lucky enough to get someone help through the power of the sub and it's subscribers a couple times when they've posted about taking their life-and I hope that you all will reach out if you need it. <3 I don't want to lose any of you. That's a pretty amusing first act as president. Actually, I think I'll use that for one of the special roundtables between now and New Years- "What Would Your First Act As President Be if Elected?" All credit for the idea will go to you, of course! :D Good evening everyone! I'm just checking back in and cleaning things up around here before I go to bed in a couple hours. I hope all of you had a very special Christmas/Hannukah/Kwanzaa/Festivus/OtherHolidayorNoneAtAll! I have something special up my sleeve for a special, 24 hour sticky post tomorrow (so in 30 minutes or so)-as well as possibly a few others through New Year's Day, when we will be moving the sub towards it's future. (We're not going away! I promise!) :)  Hahahaha- :)  Not to mention, you'll always be fashionable! :D It's actually a little below normal-that just means there's a steady stream of them popping up individually, instead of a wall of them all at once. It never stops here, just slows down. :)  Goddammint 2016! Stop taking the good ones! Trolls on Christmas seem just extra pathetic. I almost feel bad for them that they have nothing better to do. Merry Christmas Bum! <3  Thank you. She certainly knows and takes advantage of it! <3  Thank you! <3 Merry Christmas wi_voter! All I could think watching that last night was "DON'T LEAVE US." So-I'm going to brag on my fiance here for a minute, because he seriously deserves it. [His gift(s) to me was finding so many ways to make my everyday life less strenuous and painful.](http://imgur.com/a/zfjeW) I was blown away by the time and effort he put in, let alone hunting everything down, to make this happen. He knew he was getting an Amazon Echo Dot from my parents-so he decided to use that as his jumping point. He got me a bunch of stuff for automating the apartment: Phillips Vue Lights and a base station to make all the lights downstairs voice controlled, so no more having to get up, contort, or remember light switches when I go upstairs. He also got me a brand new Apple TV that ties into it, so I can have a huge range of TV options, as well as all of the new apps they have for it organized in one space. Then he got the best home automation remote and tech so my cell phone doesn't have to control all of it (I only have a 16G so my memory is almost full all the time). But there's still more: 2 new longer Lightning to USB cables for charging my things downstairs, a magnetic charging station for my Apple Watch for my nightstand (which I have to bend and contort to charge due to having a 6inch cable on the floor now). He also solved the issue of me having difficulty scrubbing the bathroom and floor and bought me a lightweight professional, rechargeable Tub and Tile scrubber. Not the cheapo as see on tv, but something that will last. I can now clean the bathrooms safely and easily and he knows how upset I've been at the quality job I've managed because I just can't do the manual scrubbing anymore. I know not many women would be moved to tears over getting a tile scrubber for Christmas, but you guys don't know how big of a deal this is for me. So many of the little things that add up to causing me more pain and exhaustion, solved. It's going to be a huge improvement in my quality of life.  Well, my parents got him an Echo Dot- so I got him a GE Home Light automation kit to go with it. However-One of his gifts to me was buying the Philips VUE hub and lights home automation kit, with bulbs for the living room! No more contorting for switches, having to get up, or having to go up/downstairs when I forgot the lights. <3  So I'm going to return it and get the right bulbs to go with the base he got. We were thinking in similar lines. I'm going to make a big comment in a minute about the entirety of his gift, because man, he deserves some bragging for this. :D I MUST HAVE THIS. It's been a wonderful one. I cried so hard at the gifts my fiance gave me-he spent HOURS and so much time thinking of ways to make my life easier.  VERY Impressive! <3 Kamela Harris is my pick. With someone like Al Franken as a VP. You have no idea how many we deal with on a daily basis here, still. YES! <3 Trek >>>>> Wars  Good afternoon everyone! Seasons Greetings to all! <3 I'm dropping in for a bit to wish you much love and happiness this holiday season, and see how everyone and everything is doing. <3 Did you all have a good day today? Get any extra-special gifts? It's been a pleasure and a joy getting to know you all, and we look forward to having you with us in the future. <3 Much love from me (and Rain!), as well as the rest of the mods here at /r/hillaryclinton to our wonderful community.  Oh SNAP! Sorry about your parents being angry, though. :/  LOLOLOL. Where on earth did you find that? > "The most confusing thing about the whole campaign of 2016 was the relationship of the two leading parties. Old-Guard Republicans complained that their proud party was begging for office, hat in hand; veteran Democrats that their traditional Covered Wagons were jammed with college professors, city slickers, and yachtsmen. The rival to Donald Trump in public reverence was a political titan who seemed to have no itch for office—Senator Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, an American Jew, a man perhaps ten years older than Trump. His weekly rallies, was to millions the very oracle of God. So supernatural was this voice from the air that for it men delayed their golf, and women even postponed their Saturday afternoon contract bridge."This seems like a gigantic rip off on Sinclair Lewis's "It Can't Happen Here."  The thing about that article is there's not really much friendliness in the Mormon Church for LGBT memebers to begin with.  Good evening everyone!#Merry Christmas, Happy Hannukah, Joyous Kwanzaa, Happy Holidays, Festivous For The Rest of Us, and anything else you may be celebrating this time of the year to you all! I made so, so much food today and now I kind of feel like I want to meld with the couch I'm so tired. We're having In-N-Out and watching Die Hard and Die Hard 2 to cap off the night, our annual tradition for a truly CA Christmas. 🎄🎄🎄 Goddammit. This is what I get for modding while I was running in four directions (I was making cranberry sauce, pie crust, trying to entertain the dog, and mod at the same time, lol.) I was thinking Hillary vs Kamela Harris and got SoS and AG mixed up in my head. Blagh. <3 That's a good idea- #ChristmasWishesForHillary!  ^This. Going in person usually yields a much better result on a landlord/tet issue like this.  She had the offending antlers removed right after the photo. She actually was more annoyed at me that I was interrupting her naptime to do so. :D Sleeping is her favorite activity. The complaints I got were "we can't run another woman right after this" and "she's not experienced enough." I'm very happy that people are warming up to the idea, regardless. :) Kamela has been a wonderful thing for California, and I was proud to vote her into her senate seat and look forward to her work there. I think she would be an amazing choice for a candidate for 2020-both a woman as well as minority with an excellent background due to being the CA AG (I still have Hillary on my brain, NOT SoS, lol), then top it off with a term as a Senator and she's golden. [I figured you guys would enjoy the brief humiliation I put my service dog through earlier for a good picture.](http://imgur.com/PGrpyXN) That's a very good point, and a complaint I've seen voiced often amongst my friends.  Honestly, I don't think it *is* the future. I think we're about to peak on the unrest in the D party, and we're going to see a huge unity movement the week or two before Inauguration Day. I do not see this lasting. I've only watched it as an adult-while a technically very well put together movie, it just never appealed to me. I prefer the stop-motion classics, myself. :)  I'm hoping Kamela will run in 2020. What's funny is I was pretty much shouted down right after the election voicing that hope-I'm a little amused that people seem to be being more vocal and/or changing their minds on that one.  It is indeed-I believe they said it wasn't going to happen until 2027 again on the radio?  Happy Hanukkah to you and everyone!I don't care what holiday people wish me-I'm just happy they're being pleasant to me. <3  Good evening everyone! I hope you are safe, happy and healthy this Christmas Eve/Hannukkah (or other holidays, or none at all!). You have our best wishes for a wonderful holiday for you all on the sub. <3We've apparently reached the time of the afternoon on Christmas when people stop getting along on the subreddit. Rumors of the sub's demise is greatly exaggerated- we're not going anywhere.EDIT: Amended to include Hanukkah for our wonderful Jewish subscribers. <3  For whoever keeps reporting this: a comment you disagree with is NOT "Threatening, harrassing, or Bulllying." This comment does not break the rules in any shape or form, and is allowed.  I have so much to cook today. 1. Cranberry Sauce 2. Cornbread for Cornbread Dressing (both of those for dinner tomorrow with the future in-laws) 3. Crust for tomorrow's breakfast quiche4. Prepping the filling for the quiche5. Gingersnaps I ran out of energy for yesterday Noooooooooooooo! [There's a Rain-Deer in my house](http://imgur.com/a/5R3sh) [This is the chronology list for his "Grand Tour" of the Universe](http://www.benbova.net/gradtourlist.html)I would start with Mars, and move forward. The first two give a lot of background and set up the universe, but aren't strictly necessary. All of the books starting from Mars showcase his amazing talent at bringing the vividness of the universe to you.He's amazing at descriptions, and it really feels like you are *there* in space.  He also tries to be scientifically correct wherever possible, and his works don't require the suspension of disbelief that most sci-fi content does. <3 We are still Stronger Together.  Mine has been fairly pleasant so far. :) <3  ~~That makes me want to vomit. DO NOT GO QUIETLY ALONG WITH THIS.~~Edit: Even a mod can fall for the "read the headline, but not notice the source and date" when trying to mod and open gifts on Skype with family. 😂  Please remember to use good sources with up to date content when posting! Awwww. I bet he's adorable. :)  /r/pantsuitnation has no affiliation with the facebook group, just fyi. The head mod of this sub created that one for our own people to use, and we're intending to ramp it up in there after the New Year. :) I'm also a moderator over there. <3 I'm glad you're still here, or I would have never met you! :D I am very fortunate that the one time I reached out to my favorite Sci-Fi author (Ben Bova) he was absolutely thrilled and delighted that his books help me escape the reality of my health issues. He's a wonderful man who had many kind remarks for me. In general though, the really popular ones can be dicks. :/  Good afternoon everyone! I hope you are all doing well. #I just want to wish you all from us here at /r/hillaryclinton (as well as of course from me personally) a very Merry *insert holiday of choice here* and a wonderful 2017 for everyone! :D <3 I love you all.  I got too busy with the sub to keep up with it at that level. :D Well, your mom can *try* to declare that, but family gatherings tend to go there anyways.  I think it was a reward offered through the app, if I recall correctly. My fiance had a final bumper sticker reward come in this week. I never did get my Woman Card, despite donating to get two of them, now that I think about it. But that's ok.  Actually, for the record-I have not received complaints from anyone, nor do we have any complaints with specific posters. You're also not the only one talking about Tulsi, she's just almost always mentioned in tandem with Bernie.I however have received a LOT of inbox messages as well as out on the sub about the volume of Bernie. (Be it pro or anti Bernie comments, the main complaint is "he's everywhere.") Our subscribers are actually saying they'll leave over it, which is a huge issue to me personally, as well as the subreddit.Most of you know I try and stay relatively neutral on Bernie, especially for the sake of the subreddit-I think he's a typical politician that's about 50/50 good ideas/bad ideas. There's not a quick answer here, because of the actions by Bernie himself. He immediately left the party he adopted-the Democrats, to go back to being an independent. However, it can't be denied he did bring new wave of people to the Democratic party, with their own set of ideas that will have to be reconciled with in the future party platforms. We've had an influx of new ideas and discussion in the sub due to the primary voters that voted for Bernie, but voted Hillary on Nov 8th. There's been some good and some bad. We're working on how to reconcile that mess at the subreddit level with the original mission and purpose of the sub in mind.  Which right now, is one of the biggest grassroots gatherings and community of Hillary Clinton supporters on the internet. While we always take your comments to heart, we only implement things that we think will *benefit* the subreddit. We very rarely have blanket banned a subject, person, or topics, and I do not see us banning any mention of a politician on this sub, ever. I LOVE it OP. <3 +1 Christmas Points to your BF. :D  Oh dear-what kind of dog do you have? :) Rain has now moved to the stage of being a needy, whiny baby after her bath. She'll just lay down and softly cry at you until you stop everything to sit and comfort her for five minutes, then she'll fall asleep. I just got her to go to sleep.  Yes-I would suggest OP work WITH the marches already in place.  That's just stomach turning. I never thought in my lifetime the KKK would rise again. I would have pretty much preferred to be wrong on any other subject. You and me both. :/ <3 *fistbump of solidarity* Yep. Pence is predictable. Trump is a wild card that does things at whim. You said it excellently. :)  Gingersnaps are next on my list, after I sit down for a bit. :D Cavvies have wonderful personalities like that. :D I have a friend who has a pair and they are a hoot. It sounds like how my past dog (just a pet-border collie/blue heeler mix) dealt with it. Zoomies around the house, and whoever bathed her is the bad guy until the next day. She could hold a grudge. :| There's a reason her nickname was Demon Dog. The thing is...it doesn't. Especially with an election looming. The FOIA requests will probably be so heavily redacted that they'll be near-worthless.  Thanks for using np. :)  Holy fuck. Where in the country (state is fine, if comfortable) are you? That's horrifying. I'm hoping it's one of those small town billboards that sometimes get bought out by the right to life people by lack of demand. Pence is a terrible kind of evil, and horribly regressive. However, if viewed as a choice between Pence OR Trump...one isn't going to launch a nuke at his whims. I never thought I'd be hoping for Pence to be the lesser evil.  Booo to the sick. It really seems to be going around this year- I know there seems to be sinus+postnasal cough going around in our community. Fiance caught it but got antibiotics about five days ago.  I'm half-convinced Dick Cheney is part cyborg at this point. Rain just gives up and stands there with sad eyes. As a 115lb mastiff, it's kind of comical. Then she loves towel drying. Right now she's sitting on my feet indigtly licking her front paws/leg. She's not a fan of water in general, despite the name. :D  I do hope that Comey at least loses his job over all that has happened but it's not going to happen without a lawsuit, at this point. :/  Putin's Puppet^TM I know I didn't tell you it would be fine, because it's not. I'm just praying we get through four years without actually launching a nuke.  OK-I'll be back in 20 after I wash (though I'm sure she thinks I'm torturing her) my poor dog. No turning the sub into a bonfire, please. Thank goodness. :)  Good evening everyone! How goes your day? I still have so much to do today, but all I feel like is laying on the couch. I still need to bathe the dog, wash the dishes, and make gingersnaps. Gah. I hope that the take out was at least really tasty!  It's unfortunately, one of the hazards of using a service dog vs a walker/wheelchair. The top most frustrating questions/comments I get: 1." What breed is that?" -I get that people are curious, but unless I am stopped and resting, this question is best reserved for the internet or your personal dog friend who can tell you from a description.2. "Why do you have her?" -Becuase I literally can't walk more than a block without her assistance on a good day? 3. "Who are you raising her for?"- The most frustrating, to be honest. If you're not missing a limb or in a wheelchair/walker, people assume "NOT DISABLED." Despite her glaring blue and green mobility harness, actively assisting me at all times, and me walking at a snail's pace with a heavy limp. The point of me having her is so I *don't* have to resort to a wheelchair or walker. 4. "It's so nice to take your dog with you everywhere! I wish I could do that!" -When she's working, she's my medical equipment. It's also an enormous hassle taking her everywhere (but it beats never being able to leave the apartment)-I have to worry about her being on point with grooming and behavior, as well as the logistics of where she goes physically. She's wonderful, but she's not a *pet* I take everywhere.5. "You don't look disabled." -Really, people?6. "I have an ESA! It's so nice he can go with me everywhere." -Actually, you're breaking the law, they don't have public access rights and aren't required to be task trained to mitigate disabilities.Service dog handler problems. Overall, though, I try and answer as many questions as I am able within the time frame I have, and I always am polite unless they're actively trying to interfere with her. I'm just so grateful she enables me to leave the apartment and I have that access. Ugh. I'm sorry dude. I hope that maybe with more cleaning and drying it recovers for you. We seriously need waterproof electronics already-Everyone remembers me infamously near-bricking my laptop due to a badly timed fainting spell and a cup of coffee during the primaries. I now have a waterproof keyboard cover for my laptop as well as not allowing liquids within 5 feet of it while operational.  You're welcome! Have a very Merry Christmas! :D I am glad you managed to return safely! Geez, that would have had me a bit nervous. You pretty much said it in a nutshell there, my friend.  Here's the thing: I/We've had a lot of complaints in the past few weeks from our subscribers that there's too much Bernie(and now, by proxy, Tulsi) in the sub and it's driving them away. (Be it pro-Bernie or anti-Bernie, a policy will have to address how to handle both.) Obviously our goal is to not drive people away from the site but rather keep drawing people in and retaining and we want to make sure our users stay happy with the sub. :) I've edited my post above to clarify. Be the embodiment of Hillary's America. Do what you would have done if she had won. Spread as much love, kindness, hope, and opportunity as you can-even if it's just a smile or support when you see someone in need. <3As I have said before: I am to be the annoying ray of fucking sunshine made out of love and kindness in their sides until the end, and I'm going to shine OBNOXIOUSLY! :D  You went to Costco TODAY???? Are you insane??? D: That place is terrifying on the best of low traffic days. I love the prices and products but absolutely hate the warehouse shopping experience, especially with my service dog in tow. People can't grasp that we are just like everyone else and are trying to get our normal shopping done on a set schedule, and they need to leave us be. Everyone things "oh one question can't hurt" but when it's literally 50-75 people asking you per trip one question, it adds up fast! Sorry, personal pet peeve/rant there. I hope you survived!  I'm a bit confused as to why we would *need* to be attached to another country in this hypothetical situation-especially CA. I'm in CA, and (should Calexit ever be more than a fairy tale), a sucession would be in my personal best interests-but I think it would also just break something deep inside of me that has always believed in my country and the power to come together and do good.  A mod has to remove the Autoscold^TM and reapprove. You're in the clear. :) FWWIW- I agree with you. I am so, so dissapointed in them all. It's like the R(s) "good old white boys" club all over again.  Good afternoon guys! I return feeling much more human with a bit of sleep. I also have some news for you as far as the site goes: 1. Automod's been looked over and things should be better as far as the accidental removal of posts. Going forward, if you have a comment that was removed, please leave the comment as is so we can review it. Don't delete and repost something over and over again, otherwise, Reddit's system flags your account and Automod will remove them automatically, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.2. I've/we've gotten a lot of complaints about the amount of Bernie/Tulsi-be it positive or negative, and that it's driving people away. We are working to address it and should have a user guideline as well as getting things around that topic shipshape. :) 3. I love you all and hope you have a wonderful holiday season with your family, friends, and loved ones. <3 May you all be safe, healthy, and happy.  Since I made the typo of the century: The future of *that* sub. This sub isn't going anywhere. This is what I get for sleepless modding. Gah-Such a terrible typo. The future of THAT sub-this one isn't going anywhere!!! OH. God, I made a terrible typo. The future of THAT sub. This sub isn't going anywhere!!!!! Ok everyone-I'll be back in a few hours after some sleep.  No major catastrophes are allowed to happen in that time period, please. <3  We do however, here have a clear policy on Clinton Bashing and things will be dealt with accordingly. :D  Full Disclosure: I was recently added to their mod team, looking towards the future of ***THAT*** sub. However, I'm not really functioning as a moderator (other than some obvious/blatant things that land in my queue) there atm because my orientation was delayed by the holidays. However, as a user-I think they're having some difficulty deciding the future of the sub, and if the remts of the BoB crowd that have turned into Hillary-Bashers are going to be welcomed there or not. While they call themselves democrats, IMO, their attitudes say otherwise.  My Xmas cards have turned into New Year's cards, and I didn't get our decorations up until about a week ago. :D I hear you.  I hear you on the no money thing. I had a very, very strict budget on the few gifts that I give. Homemade cookies are a wonderful gift! People greatly underestimate the value of a big thing of Christmas cookies. I limited myself to two batches this year- a 9x13" pan of sugar cookie bars, and an enourmous batch of gingersnaps. :D  A piece of brevity this AM: [Scientists in HI named a new fish species after Obama :D](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/scientists-name-new-fish-species-in-hawaiis-papahanaumokuakea-after-obama/2016/12/20/81c445c6-c62c-11e6-8bee-54e800ef2a63_story.html?utm_term=.9ca187862c83) I know human beings are at heart, illogical- I'm just questioning the enormous justification and stretching of the truth that went on in his mind to get to the conclusion that a terrorist attack on Germany is terrific fuel for their campaigns. I'm working on my letter to Biden right now. :D I'm going to wait and see what happens the next two years before I decide. My instinct is to protect her, but people are probably going to be begging for her by the time Trump is done. :/ EDIT: Before coffee this morning, I forgot the age aspect of things. I think she's going to be considered too old to run, especially as a woman. [They appear to have killed the Berlin attack suspect.](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/23/world/europe/berlin-anis-amri-killed-milan.html?_r=0) Does anyone else prefer the UK/Europe response to terrorist attacks? The "business as usual" attitude that started during WWI, I mean. They don't seem to become so paralyzed as a nation like we do. Everything gets cleaned up, opened back up, and people act like it didn't happen, for large part, other than acknowledging the victims. I feel like this takes a lot of the power out of the terrorist's hands.  If Obama DARES do that, I'm going to burn everything to the ground. Meaning I will at least write him a very, very scathing letter. NAILED IT. There wouldn't be an issue if they weren't profiting off this "fundraising." If he was truly just showing up to be the celebrity figure to drive the profits, there would be no conflict of interest. Good morning everyone! (Well, rather, I tried to go to sleep for a while and woke up only a couple hours later.) How are all of you today? Do you have all of your holiday shopping done? Any gifts you're really proud of this year? He would, but he's expressed interest and is leaving the door open. I mean, Bernie is talking about making a run at almost 80.  Your last line nailed it, so much so. It's really disappointing to see the "economic populism" gain ground in the party, and worse yet, actually CATERING to it. The party will go nowhere as long as people are fed the line of "us vs them." This is the very point we should be tossing aside the quite frankly petty arguments and infighting and focus on coming together to fight Trump.  Gah- I just saw Biden's latest comments about Hillary and now I'm pissed all over again. He's throwing her under the bus using his own biases so he can set himself up for a possible 2020 run. >:| It angers me that he tries to say he's a champion for women and minorities, refuses to acknowledge and address the known biases that exist in his "WWC" base of sexism and racism, and pits it as a class war struggle of "elitist dems" vs "WWC/Regular Joes." He just lost a significant amount of respect from me due to his low-hanging blows at Hillary. I really hope I'm not the only one who is absolutely pissed at Biden on this one (and you all know how much I adore the guy). But his privilege and ignorance is glaringly showing here. I know he's trying to set himself up for a run in 2020, but this is just appalling. Especially considering everything Hillary has done for him and Obama. It's not enough for a woman to have her OWN ambitions and want to be president, because she can do the best job. Or the passionate speeches and platforms that she campaigned her heart out in 2008 AND 2016 that covered why she wanted to be President-to make America stronger together and better than it has been. Oh no-she ran because "she thought she had no choice." A woman can't just WANT to be president. I'm sorry Biden-but if you're going to put on blinders to your own biases as well as the glaring issues of sexism and racism that exist IN your base, and play class wars of "elitist dems" vs "working class dems," you've already lost my potential vote and respect. You're welcome- though most of the hard work on that one was done by progress18, behind the scenes. :D  I'm so glad that I have our regulars mostly memorized by now, because otherwise your comment about gave me a heart attack before I got to the /s. :D We actually had a troll come by and try and argue that this isn't a big deal because:  "ebola burns itself out before becoming a big issue," "media coverage is not proportional to the number of victims," (Which there's a big REASON it's so widely covered.), and "curing a disease is great but there are bigger diseases that deserve the label?" (It's a vaccine, not a cure...)  I believe /u/AATRWY, /u/JoeFabooche, and /u/yas-gurl were the ones who directly mentioned it-just want to make sure you guys see the update. Ok guys-Automod is good to go. Going forward, if you have a comment that was removed, please leave the comment as is so we can review it. Don't delete and repost something over and over again, otherwise, Reddit's system flags your account and Automod will remove them automatically, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.  We will not give up. We will not give in. <3 #StrongerTogether  That's very true. I didn't even try an attempt at that, the previews were so bad. Did anyone actually sit through Gods of Egypt?  Well, at least it wasn't a complete flop, then. We'll have to see... it would be very hard to improve on the original.  Fiance and I just put on Independence Day: Resurgence. Is it any good? Obviously the original is a classic, but I'm leery of these reboot movies. Ha-you guy got my noodle working tonight. I'm rolling back the sleeves and seeing if I can create some end of the year magic around here during the holidays, if at all possible.  :D Nah-you guys take that title.  That gives me a great idea- a year-end sticky post of the *positive news* 2016 has brought us. There's been a LOT of innovation and good things that have gotten buried. I think I'll pull that out next Monday the 26th!  [In other news, look at this! The experimental Ebola vaccine is now pushing 100% effectiveness!](http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/22/health/ebola-vaccine-study/?sr=google_news)That's HUGE!  Fix is in the works. <3  Fix is in the works! :) Sorry it got so bad, I had computer issues for a few days and didn't catch it sooner. OK-Automod should be getting a tweaking that will hopefully stop eating all of you guys posts! I know it was starting to have some issues right before I left, so this *should* fix it. I'm going through and approving comments this thread, but please let me know if your comments aren't getting through elsewhere this time tomorrow.  I will make sure to sticky it starting very shortly. Computer issues got me down for a few days. I'll see what I can do-no one is being purposely censored but it looks like automod is on the fritz.  Jesus guys-I am so sorry things are such a mess. My computer started having issues and it took a few days to fix it- I was having kernel panics and the damn thing required a reinstall of the OS in the end. I was trying to avoid that due to it being a hassle.  Problem 1: Automod is being cranky-I'm going to take a look at that and see if we can get it fixed up so you guys posts aren't being caught.Problem 2: I've caught up the queue that was stuffed again, if you see troll comments, please report them and I'll remove/ban as appropriate. If there are any other issues, please reply to this and I'll make sure things are functional again. I will look into this guys-I've been having computer issues the past few days-I got a dreaded root process issue with my laptop.  Thankfully their lawyer had more smarts than them and told them to leave me alone in the end. But it was a very tense couple of weeks as we waited to see what would happen. If they'd attempted it, it would have been huge trouble for them.  I've been so, so tempted to. I'm just afraid they'd know who sent it.  They're awful people. They fight in front of their kids CONSTANTLY and communicate *at* them (not with them) with screaming. Every. Time. The kids also regularly use the apartment as an indoor playground, with playground voices and all. The shared wall and our things hanging on it sometimes shake so hard we worry about them falling down. As a disabled person with a service animal, I 100% agree with you.  So, so awkward when your next door neighbors are having a screaming fight on their back patio about who cheated on who and if they're cheating now, while you can hear more than one of the six kids crying in the background. These are the same ones I have posted about previously that have been awful to us, and tried to get us evicted because I have a service dog. I found out later on they actually hired a lawyer to try and find ANY legal way to do it, because the female neighbor told him that I couldn't possibly be disabled. Why? I have Rain's essential mobility harness (made by a friend at a HUGE discount) and the necessary gear (which had to all be bought on significant sales and as cheaply as possible) in order for her to perform her job. I had a very, very strict budget when outfitting her. She also took issue with the fact I was furthering her education with a professional trainer to make sure we're working to her (and my) fullest potential, as well as working smarter and not harder. Service Dogs NEVER stop learning their entire career...and the more they can effectively help their human, the better.  That's a good idea too.  Ha- he wouldn't believe me in a million years. I'm militant about not giving birth and have been since I was 8-the point I grasped that I would more than likely pass on my major health issues diagnosed. At that point, when I only had a few major conditions (vs the 10+ I have now) I considered it cruel and inhumane. Now that my situation has gotten so much worse, I consider allowing a biological child in my life, legal torture of a helpless being and a crime against humanity. I'd also almost certainly die if I tried to carry it beyond the first 6-12 weeks, let alone bring to term. My body cannot handle the strain, especially without the essential meds I would have to go off of in an effort to NOT give it birth defects. Fiance also wishes to remain childfree, but is not as absolute hardline about it as I am. We're very frank with each other on the subject, and he immediately would ask me when the appointment for the abortion is so he could take me. I also just don't personally believe that pregcy is something to joke about. It's one of the biggest (if not the biggest) life changing experiences, and a lot of times, in a very, very bad and negative way. Especially if the pregcy wasn't planned.  They will *try* to not let it release before then, but I'm pretty sure *something* will leak in those few weeks between everything. Just due to the historical groundbreaking involved here.  I'm considering that option. I'm just not sure *what* to make that he'd appreciate-he's very much a "this needs to be a functional gift" vs something fitting but nonfunctional. I've tried some very targeted appeals in the past that were too nonfunctional, and were huge flops. Such a disappointing lack of good reaction sucks, especially if you spent a lot of time looking for it or made it.  Having grown up as a child being forced to do the "match with all the other members" game, usually involving a highly uncomfortable piece of clothing, I remember how absolutely miserable I was. For years we had matching heavy wool sweaters that were both hideous and extremely itchy. Not to mention the fact being forced to wear it in the Texas heat (almost always 75+) with a significant lack of allowing changing. I don't mind matching accidentally-but when people get obsessed with doing it on purpose, it's just creepy to me. Like "let me remove all the outward individual expression for the sake of the *appearance* of the family. With my parents, it was always about the appearance of things vs the reality. Bonus creepy points if they write a yearly newsletter/letter about how everyone is doing wonderful.  I completely agree. The tax returns need to be a *requirement,* not just relying no the good faith of the candidates to do so that we have operated on until now. As far as medical records-I think the ideal would be a review by a team of docs that DON'T know the candidates personally. No more relying on their personal physicians-there needs to be a consensus by as an impartial team (or however close to getting impartial) for fitness to run.   \o/ I love the liberalism that abounds in the state. We have a wonderful governor (Nickname can't bring him down!) The nickname was actually a compliment when he first earned it, but people adopted it to mean other things. The nickname was brought about by a journalist saying he was appealing to the "Moonbeam Vote" for courting to the young, idealistic, and nontraditional. Setting aside the D vs I argument, he and Bernie are similar in that aspect. However, they don't line up in a lot of key policies, the ability to get people to turn out on Election day, Brown having been on the national stage regularly for many years, and Bernie's failure to appeal to key demographics. Brown appeals to the widest majority of demographics overall in CA which means his voting base is enormous.Bernie was not able to get ahead in some very important demographics: * Minorities * Seniors* Overall Democratic Voters (he lost by 30%) * Tied with Hillary for very liberal voters, but Hillary dominated the somewhat liberal and moderate voters* Hillary lead with every level of education (high school or less, some college education, college graduates, and Post-Grad education) * She actually won *all* the demographics for income by at least 10% (Under 50k, 50k-100k, and over 100k) * Overal Women's voteThere were a few demographics Hillary lost ground to Bernie. Rural white voters, college town voters, a slight (1% or less) advantage of white voters overall, independents, and age 17-29ers.  This is just plain sad and ridiculous. He can't even handle using *built-in* spelling correctors and make sure his tweets aren't misspelled! The President-Elect is having elementary school spelling issues. That's *very* presidential of him. /s Good morning everyone! A very early morning for me, I guess, since it's 4:15 am. I haven't been able to sleep all night, and I get to the point that it feels like trying anymore is a waste of valuable time in which I could be productive. So I'm modding the sub while trying to figure out what to get my fiance for Christmas. He's the type of person that is near impossible to buy for-if he wants something he'll just buy it, and he can't think of what he wants, lol. I'm hoping that one of the Amazon holiday gift guides yields something unique and useful. We're already getting an Amazon Echo dot from my parents as our joint gift.  I really hate that we never got to see what was in his taxes. This sets a precedent too, for any future candidates who don't want transparency on their taxes.  That's one that truly terrifies me. He thinks he knows absolutely everything about everything, better than the all the intelligence agency employees and military leaders. Our foreign policy is going to be based on his whims. National security is going out the window and I'm concerned that it's his *plan* to try and allow/passively encourage a terrorist attack that would unite the country behind him. Similar to Bush and 9/11 and how so many people instantly flocked to him and the War in Afghanistan.  Not to mention, going against the very things America stands for and was founded on.  We intend to keep it alive and active. We believe there is value in being a slice of the better America Hillary envisioned, as well as such a strong community, in the coming years. As long as you all are still here, and it doesn't completely die out-it will be. I know I'm going to do everything I can to keep that from happening. One only hopes that they will grow out of it eventually, and see the light. I completely understand removing them from your feed though-I do too. It's the deplorable things you had to either be complacent with or directly support in order to vote for him. I personally think after the EC vote things will calm down quite a bit. I agree with you on your last paragraph. I think the issue right now is that we, as a public, don't quite understand the lack of response to Russia's interference. I know Obama and HIllary must have good reasons, they just haven't said publicly, myself. What is happening, I think, is a lot of anger at the situation at hand that may not always be directed or channeled in the right direction. We are #StrongerTogether with #LoveAndKindness. We must never, ever forget that. If they fracture us, we're guaranteed to lose.  Yep-we can stand up for a lot of things at once. Plus one can argue that part of standing up to the extreme Republican agenda is trying everything we can to *prevent* them from implementing them. I will respect the EC's vote no matter the outcome-but there is no issue with hoping for a better outcome. Jerry Brown has also committed to still fighting climate change despite Trump. I'm happy and proud to live in the state I'm in. I am very sad to see you go-I can't say I fully understand why, to be honest, but I respect it. You've been a great contributor and I'm sad to lose your POVs. You will always be welcome here- and I want to make perfectly clear that if you think you see something that violates the sub rules *please* report it. We mods cannot change or deal with the things we don't know about, and none of us can be in all threads with all comments. I wish you the best of luck and you'll be in my thoughts. I hope you have wonderful things coming your way.  They can keep trying to report this thread, but it's not coming down.  Everyone has the right to an individual opinion on this. Personally, I disagree with yours, but I respect your opinion and it's not "wrong." There's not a general "right answer."   My life is on the line with a Trump Presidency-as well as my fiance's and the majority of my friends. I cannot give up with that at stake. I personally could never forgive myself if I didn't keep fighting for them as well as myself.  Well,[ I at least have one year left in me. I can only hope they still try and keep it operating at a state level in the future.](http://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Covered-California-to-court-uninsured-despite-10607027.php)  NEVER let them rebrand it-call it what it is. White nationalism. White supremacy. Facism.  Pay no attention to the troll on the subreddit... ;)  The problem is, unless we actually *prevent* those things, the millions who didn't vote for Trump become innocent casualties in the mess, having their rights stripped away that they never agreed to.  I am a very big fan and believer of the motto James Lawrence uttered as his last command before his death, later immortalized by the Battle of Lake Erie (War of 1812) and Oliver Hazard Perry's battle flag. "Don't give up the ship." I'm not going to give up the ship.  I do too-it seems like a long stretch that he had no direct knowledge when they were doing so much interference to get him elected. But I'm waiting for them to confirm/deny with evidence before I'm comfortable saying there was.  If I am at all physically able, I'm going to be at the San Diego march.  Or that great amounts of people don't die before '18 comes about due to the new legislation. :/  Well, I'm going to keep writing everyone I can-From Obama, Biden, his cabinet, and as many Representatives and Congressmen that I can manage before Inauguration Day. If he does get inaugurated, I will keep writing letters to all of the Representatives and Congressmen, especially the new ones. I refuse to let them not hear our voices and the consequences we face if things like the ACA and climate change is ignored (and so many others). I will write for EVERY bill they bring up that damages this country and its people. I refuse to give up as long as there is breath in my body.  Ok, that gets a solid 12 out of 10 on the "what the actual fuck" scale.  That's true. I guess we'll see what comes of the investigation and in the next few weeks. Yep-I'm just wondering at this point if there was or not-there's no evidence for a direct accusation of that sort, at least now. You make a good point about his ability to keep secrets though. Though he's made all those calls to world leaders, most that we don't know what was discussed.  Obviously Comey played a huge part, as well as other things-I'm just wondering if Trump either asked Putin/Russia for a direct intervention, or he was directly knowledgeable that they were interfering and was complacent. Because that would be pretty huge.  I'm wondering if there was a direct conversation between Trump and Putin, or other people in Russia about interfering with the election. If Trump directly knew from Russia itself, and was complacent in it OR actually asked for them to intervene, it's the smoking gun. Of course! It's highly important to me that this sub stays alive and kicking. We are a stand against Trump's America, and believe in making things like Hillary's America *has* come about, despite the election results.  Thank you. <3 You're welcome. You all are very important to me, and I try and be here in every spare moment I can.  I don't think Ellison is the right choice in a million years- but personally I don't think Perez is the answer. But I could always be wrong. I'd actually like to see Al Franken or Amy Klobuchar take the position.  You probably have gotten responses, but the answers are rulebreaking and were removed by Automod or a moderator. (I had to remove two responses to this comment alone, due to Trolling, Misleading Content, and Bad Sources.  I do. This is one area I have a big complaint about in Obama. Hillary was an EXCELLENT Secretary of State and I feel that would have given her a huge advantage in dealing with this.  I don't know if they can keep it from leaking that long, in the age of technology we have. Not to mention how controversial the info is.  <3 I love you all too. No matter what, I'll still be here and caring about you.  While it's an incredibly long shot-I still have to hold onto the sliver of hope and possibility that some may be planning to defect in secret. Otherwise, the chances remaining move to the Election being declared invalid, or they prove a direct Russia-Trump link before Obama leaves office, and he's charged with treason. After all the thousands of hours I've put into this for Hillary- I just feel personally that completely giving up until all hope is gone does a disservice to her legacy as well as the Election process as we know it. I however, do not blame anyone who does, nor is that opinion wrong. It's just me, personally. (Want to make sure that is clear-everyone in the sub is entitled to their opinons) JFC. WHY NOT? The last count I saw was 40 of them demanding it-that's huge.  I keep up online-that way I can choose to avoid the normalization of Trump and his behavior.  Yep-which keeps confirming more and more that this is Russia's fault. What I want to know is if Trump's campaign *knew* about Russia's involvement-especially Trump himself.  That would be awesome- I would love wireless charging. Especially if you could connect USBs to the charging station to charge things that don't have wireless-like an Apple Watch, iPads, and iPods. One central station for everything, and no more hauling multiple chargers everywhere. Absolutely no ableism allowed in this subreddit. This is your one warning. Should you continue to violate R2, you will be permanently banned. Well, the headphone jack is probably not coming back for future phones-but if you have a newer 6 it's probably not worth it yet. I plan on trading in my six in 2 more years, when it's four years old for the latest version on the market. I don't think that 7 greatly improves on 6 enough to justify it, myself. 2 more generations, maybe.  Also-if anyone has any issues, please send in a modmail and I'll take care of them/look into it. I apologize for being gone for several days, but I had my infusion on Tuesday and the side effects were a lot more severe than usual due to me being so run-down.  FYI-I have cleared the queues, but I have to step away for 15-20 minutes to take the dog out and see if she'll walk a bit-it's raining so I may be back sooner than that, but if you see bad comments, please report them so I can take care of them when I get back. Hello everyone! How goes your day? Looking forward to a good weekend? I got almost all of my Christmas shopping done, on the cheap, too! I'm still trying to figure out what to get the fiance, though. He's the hardest person to shop for, because if he wants something he'll just buy it-and he can't think of gifts he wants for himself. I'm going to find something though.  One can do both at the same time.  I will ask the head mod-but for now I'll try to remove them as I see them.  Yep-unfortunately the trolls will try anything.  Ah-Sorry I misunderstood there.  We have particuary amusing trolls this AM. Apparently the report is false because Wikileaks already said so.  Bill Clinton was not just for the white working class. He supported the overwhelming majority of Americans, and legislation that helped people get ahead. Other than the whole Monica Lewinski thing, and a few positions in the Violent Crime and Law Enforcement Act, he presidentcy was an enormous success.  Personally, I'm not counting the chickens before they've hatched-Obama still has something up his sleeve.  Not if he's arrested for treason, or a number of other different scenarios.  We are stronger together as the army of love and kindness. :D  Mostly, yes. I also have a few friends who are freaking out due to being die-hard and very literal about the Constitution.  I'm hoping if it's damning enough, the other Electoral College voters will want to see it.  He did also meet with Putin during the primaries. This gives a whole lot more suspicion to that meeting. I do agree that it seems like Obama is planning something-I just do not have an idea yet to his strategy. I'm sure that it has been documented, but I don't think they'll reveal that info until the investigation is over and on his desk.  Good morning everyone! How goes the day? Well, we were certainly right about Russia. The scary thing is, I've seen so many people saying it doesn't matter. Do you guys think they'll find evidence that Trump was directly tied to this? I mean, that would be treason. The only good thing is the Electoral College is demanding the intelligence report before voting.  Of course! However, The Christmas Invasion will always be my favorite Christmas special. :D Tent was my doctor. Hello everyone! How are you this evening?  Now that is clever! I don't either. Unless they instructed her to lay low while this investigation went on? So that it could be investigated without being tied to her? I heard it on the radio shortly after the election-but I can't find the blurb anywhere. I'm wondering if the radio had it wrong, now.  That's what I was wondering, too.  I'm still hoping Obama does SOMETHING before he's out of office.  I'm also wondering if this was known or at least suspected when he put out his statement about the election, that he and Michelle "lost a friend" (in Hillary).  Good afternoon everyone!!!! I've been asleep until now today-it seems like I make it through the week and then just crash on the weekends right now. How are all of you? Nate Silver's analysis...It just enrages and frustrates me. This Election was not valid, in my opinion, and Hillary will always be the winner to me with the evidence that has come out. I wish there was a mechanism in place for a do over, but our Founding Fathers probably never envisioned this in a million years.  Please just keep being your wonderful selves. <3 I will certainly let you know if I think of something. :)  We will certainly consider it, at this point. My fiance is fairly tied to his job here, and his parents are here too, however. :/  <3 Love you too. It's been an honor to do this with you.  I will promise you guys and women this much-I will remain here as long as I am able, and be here for you. I'm terrified of what the next year is going to bring for me if they demolish the ACA. But I will not give up. I will not give in. I will fight for the America Hillary wanted us to be. I've spent thousands of hours here and for everything we stand for. I will not give up and I will not lose hope. I'' going to be the ray of fucking sunshine in Trump's side until the end. I love and care about you all.  I am very grateful that I have been able to be a moderator here, and we have such an amazing community, that is true. I just have to hope that somehow, either they fail in the ACA repeal, or somehow CA manages to input the key things (patient protections and the exchanges and ability to buy directly from the insurance company) though personally. Or I'm going to be gone. I cannot tell you how fucking terrified I am right now.  Please PM me or send in a modmail. Reminder: Anyone found to be harassing people through PM in the sub, earn an automatic ban and report to the admins. Unfortunately they've been pretty awful today, personally. :/ I'm sorry that this has happened to so many of you.  I keep starting to cry. :(  Sorry for the backup in the queue-we had a troll come through and report most of the posts on the main page, and I had to step away for three hours for a doc appt. It's fixed now and I'm watching it from the passenger seat.  I was referring to the electoral vote-it was a theory in one of the articles that I read through this AM. If she *did* get the Electoral College vote, she would put Kaine up for the job.  To wait until December 19th and accept the position if it happened. That's all  I was wishing she would do. It's just very hard to understand to me (because I'm sure there's a lot more to her decision) how she didn't after how hard she has fought her entire life, and especially the campaign. It just seems so out of character for her, especially when she had the overwhelming support of 3 million more votes than Trump, and so many people fighting for her still. She has, however, done more than enough to earn her retirement from politics about 1000x over. It's just personal disappointment because I feel so bad that her confidence has taken such a blow.  That doesn't mean she could not go down fighting.  So I went to bed early last night. I frankly...I just can't believe it. I honestly Just  can't. My heart is just breaking right now. I just don't understand why. I don't at all. Do they somehow think Kaine has a better chance at the electoral college vote because he's male and has a less persecuted past? I don't understand with almost 3 million more votes, and the so much of the country rallying and changing their mind. What is so at risk-everything she has fought for. The ACA, women's rights, championing for the minority and disabled community...everything she has ever worked for. With so, so many with everything to lose-including their lives. I just don't understand.  Yep-plenty of other resources to be mined as well. It makes me sick. Yes, he does sum it up well.  I'm making it. :) I do a pretty good job of putting one foot in front of the other, even when I'm pretty down for the count.  There's a significant amount of oil under some of them, among other things.  I'm technically a millennial, by date, but I do not self-identify as one. I am largely ashamed of most of my generation and how checked out people are. (though we in the sub, and many did pull hard across the country for Hillary) and it's failings. I really, really feel as if it goes beyond just calling the next generation lazy at this point. Look at what the generations before us have accomplished largely by people our current age. We really have not done anything CLOSE to it. Unless they're actively getting some payoff or benefit from it, people are largely checked out of politics and think "it won't affect me." I can't tell you how many people I know of the age have taken the attitude "I'll be fine, that's all that matters." We're the selfish generation. The me generation.  I can only hope there would be some kind of revolt against it by the military brass. I have little hope he won't sign it. Though it's completely unconstitutional. I refuse to give up until the final, faintest chances are gone. I just can't after the 15+ hours a day I pulled during the campaign on here, aside from my health break. I know it's probably foolish and stubborn as hell (which I am known to be), but I just...I don't know. I feel like I'm doing her a disservice if I do, as well as this entire sub and what we still stand for. What. The. Actual. Fuck. They're seriously trying to normalize the blatant sexism that existed??? Grabbing women by the vagina for fucks sake!!!!  She does deserve better. Plus she's been fighting for 30+ years and came *so* close. I cannot imagine how devastated she is, because I know in her shoes I would feel like I had failed the country, as well as women's rights and everything I championed. That good, does not indeed triumph over evil.  <3 We're still Stronger Together.  He managed to become president, despite everyone initially thinking that there was no way possible for him in the primaries. Do not underestimate Trump+a Republican majority in Congress. Largely a free ride to legislation he wants. Not to mention the Supreme Court picks that will set the country back by 20+ years.  There's just no way for a non-profit to keep up with the demand.  Please report, report, report, so that I may take care of them swiftly and efficiently! Thank you! I'm sorry. People really, really underestimate the powerful impact that losing your hair can have. Speaking as someone who spent most of the past year and a half with a buzz cut to hide the giant random patches due to nutritional deficiencies, and is losing it again. I underestimated how hair has such a huge impact on your identity and gained a LOT more sympathy and respect for people who suffer from hair loss, especially at an early age. The sad thing is-so many of them vote against their interests time and time again.  This pretty much nails it and toss in the issues with our educational system and the fact that no matter how poor, white Americans generally believe that they are still "above" minorities. add in systematic racism passed down and taught to kids, that rather than believe those jobs are gone, undocumented immigrants "stole them all."and you yield generation after generation of this. Not to mention the part poverty does play, yet the mindset is usually "fuck you, I got mine and ***I*** actually deserve it unlike everyone else.  I never thought I'd be somewhat grateful for Lindsey Graham. LOL. I somehow didn't see this response Monday. Now why the hell don't we have that kind of thing in the USA, for emergency glasses situations. I'm risking Zenni because it's the only thing I can afford at this point. There's just no room in the budget for anything else, unless I figure out how to make money appear out of thin air. Good morning/afternoon everyone! I hope your day is going most excellently. I apologize for not being around yesterday. I'm fighting a sinus infection/pneumonia combo that is kicking my ass (and it's so far kicking the two antibiotics I started Monday). I'm just plain worn out. One very sad thought I had about a Trump presidency today that really got to me for some reason: He's going to have the authority to open National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges to drill, baby drill. Since that seems to be his main energy plan (along with bringing back big coal), I'm fairly certain that he'll do it. All those years protecting them, and some of the last big slices of the (relatively unspoiled)  wilderness in America. I grew up with our family vacations being National Parks instead of Disney, etc, more traditional destinations. I'm just grieving at the thought that I may be one of the last generations to truly enjoy them as they were meant to be. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_urticariaI have this as well as the cholinergic urticaria. For me, those welts will happen anywhere the sun hits within 10 minutes or so and take 1-3 days to go fully away, ONLY if I avoid going outside 100%. Or else the reaction starts again. Get too much sun and I can go into anaphylaxis. The best part is it's a somewhat delayed, building reaction-so while you see the faint outlines and that of the bumps, and it doesn't LOOK too terrible. A few hours later, that skin will be a bright red, raised lumpy mass of interconnected hives.So I step outside and instantly have the cholerginic urticaria and it's tiny blisters, then that fun happens later and lasts forever. Bah. I really should buy stock in the sunscreen market-zinc oxide based sunscreen is the only one I've found that will actually work and delay the onset/prevent it a bit. Get whatever looks good on you, not what's in style. I've been wearing acetate frames for the last 10 years or so, but I may change it up. Depends on what's in my budget and available. I am in CA-I'm basically looking for a short turnaround time and the ability to buy 2+ pairs for what I'd normally pay for 1 pair at Walmart/Costco. Thank you guys so much. I'm mainly looking for a cheap option where I can buy a couple pairs for the price I'd pay for one at Walmart/Costco. I have to update mine every two years, so I think two pairs will last until then and then I have backups again. I've got sinus infection/bronchitis (that may now be pneumonia by the escalation, but we'll see). I just want to get the right antibiotic and feel better at this point. I hope you get better soon! I haven't watched it yet, but they really were preparing things for a bang of an ending.  Non-politics related question: Anyone have success ordering eyeglasses online? I'm looking at Glasses USA because of Zenni Optical's 3 week wait. My glasses, and backup pair, both broke within a week and now I'm forced to wear my sunglasses 24/7 until I get the new ones like a douchebag. I'm just hoping no one gets hurt, mainly the protesters. I just can't see Trump not demanding the police, security, etc, to bring them down like the fist of an angry god. (Which is how he views himself.) Holy cow-I've not met another person with it! I also have solar (and sweat) urticaria, thanks to my primary immune deficiency. I cannot imagine dealing with it in Australia, especially in the summertime. You guys have some of the strongest sunlight year round. You're flared daily, I imagine, even despite all the proper precautions. SoCal is difficult, but I've figured out how to manage. I hope you feel better soon.  Just yesterday, a troll asked if there was "any proof" to the fact that Trump, the alt right, and the idealism promoted in those two subs perpetuates and supports crime. Good evening everyone! How are you? My apologies for being gone most of yesterday and today-I've actually been asleep for almost all of the past two days due to the infection I have getting suddenly worse. I finally was able to drag myself out of bed about 45 minutes ago for longer than 10 minutes at a time. After today, I'm beginning to wonder if there will be a lot of serious Trump-regrets will be present in the Electoral College Republicans by the 19th.  I refuse to believe there isn't even a chance. We DO deserve this. We are still the majority. Good IS still the majority. The majority wanted Hillary. The majority *does not want this.* We cannot give up.  I have a feeling Obama is facepalming. So much facepalming. While Biden is offering to go rough up Trump and show him who's boss. Pleaaaaaase EC voters, see what a disaster you will foist on the world if you vote Trump. Please, please save our country from this. I had totally forgotten about that automod feature. I've unfortunately thought about this- he will see no problem with protesters getting shot, maimed, beaten, or otherwise treated badly. In fact, he will gleefully enjoy it, I'm sure. Jesus. We really are repeating the rise of Hitler. We have learned nothing. You're welcome! Always happy to do so. :)  I saw tampered, but who knows with unconfirmed rumor? I understand. We're here to stay! I don't think any of us would dream of wanting to shutter it. That would be the very antithesis to Hillary and her message. Not to mention, I'm committed to staying until the sub ends or I do, lol. I think you'll be safe-if there's teeth to this, it will be tomorrow before the major details come out as the reporters get cracking. They also can restrict whatever they want. One must remember that Reddit is a private business, and not subject to the Constitution and its Amendments. To me that sub is on par with being as bad as the subreddits they did cull a while back that was so controversial. It should be removed due to the fact it perpetuates hate crimes. Aren't neighbors *wonderful?*  Quite a few are taking a break until the Electoral College vote. I've gotten some PMs from people when they left that they'd be back after that happens. I think the stress of everything, plus people's personal life stress is getting a bit overwhelming for some folks, which there's nothing wrong with. I had to take a few days break after Election Day, myself, when the reality of everything to come came crashing all down on me all at once. I just shut down for a few days. Sometimes people need a little time before you can get up and fight again. Hi guys- It's come to my attention that there are claims from Jill Stein's camp and on some third party liberal blogs that they found confirmation of voter fraud in Wisconsin voting machines. Until verified by a MSM outlet, submissions concerning it will be removed, per subreddit rules about unconfirmed stories. Confirmed stories only please- and with a MSM source of some kind (especially for something as serious as this) and not an outside site with known bias.   Much appreciated! :D Good evening everyone! I hope your day went well. How are all of you?This Trump Taiwan thing, looking into the details...jesus. We're going to be lucky if this doesn't make our relations with China immediately turn hostile. Also, more than FIFTY PERSONAL CALLS with foreign leaders, almost all of them with no guidance or knowledge from the State Department. Not to mention he hasn't had his national security briefings because he refused them. The proper thing to do is send in a modmail to us with details and we'll talk to you about it, as well as use the report button on the PM. We do not tolerate harassment through PMs on /r/hillaryclinton, and it will earn anyone proven to be doing so a ban from the subreddit. But but but he *knows* better. Because he says so. *rolls eyes* Detailed article already posted: https://www.reddit.com/r/hillaryclinton/comments/5g5x1e/donald_trump_risks_china_rift_with_taiwan_call/ Oh, I do. They all get reported to the admins. I find it ridiculous that people go out of their way to do it, tbh. That could be-I actually think that the party will unite again, but it's going to take some time. We certainly swayed more conservative after 9/11, but came back to our roots. Oh, I totally agree. 100% separation of church and state. I would love to see someone from the STEM field, teachers, professors, etc. Just something beyond the usual variety of people who run.If he chooses to run on that platform, the GOP will kill us on that one.  It's ok-I'm pretty good at dealing with it, and it doesn't scare me. It's just a very, very unpleasant reminder of what is out there. It just makes me wonder how men can wonder why women are cautious around male strangers or at night, etc, when this kind of thing exists. Unfortunately, I remember that chapter in history class all too well. It appears that a significant majority of America missed class as far as the rise of the Nazi party and how/why it happened. I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and wait and see if he tries to push religion from his position, but that's a concern of mine as well. It is definitely a buzzword bingo term that is getting overused but we also need to be conscious of the fact that if we keep only picking far-left picks, we're basically doing the 180 mirror of the Republicans when the Tea Party was started. There needs to be a spectrum in order to maintain the balance of the party.   Horseshoe Theory is becoming closer and closer to reality.  Not to mention the fact that a major terror attack could actually UNITE the country behind Trump because it will revive the post 9/11 fear. We're just all feminist killjoys, don't you know? ;)  Some of the PM's I've received on the subject of my feminism and outspokenness on women's issues on the sub have been...less than stellar. Nothing like some rape threats to get your morning going.  Disclaimer: I am a member of the millennial generation. However, this article does a good job of breaking down the numbers and actually supporting the argument it presents in that younger voters moved third-party in the last days of the election. Since this was Robby Mook saying it, I felt it relevant to the sub. It is not meant as an insult to all millennials. Plus all of these calls are being made on his private line. This is something that will be happening *regularly* with him. Bahahaha-I should have. I think it's partially due to self-awareness, and partially due to the fact that thanks in large part to Trump (with a smattering helping by a *subset* (not all) of Bernie's supporters on the sexism front) these things have become normalized over the past couple years. It's of course not all on them look at the huge following TRP has now on reddit and IRL. It's now socially OK and accepted to voice the thoughts they've had all along. where before they may have tried to go with the flow, and been too afraid/ashamed to say it for fear of repurcussions. The douches have always been there, just waiting for their turn. But now we have a *President Elect* who is racist, sexist, mysogonistic, ableist, anti-immigrant, anti-LGBTQ-and most importantly, preaches the (false) narrative of persecution of whites-which is pretty much the ultimate OK-ing of that behavior in America. In their minds, *they* have been the victims all along for so many years, silenced and forced to be "PC" (aka treat others like equal human beings). They'd stood at the top for so many years, and now in their view women/minorities/LGBT/the disabled/etc are trying to encroach on "their rights." They don't want to share, basically, is what it boils down to. When we start asking for, fighting for equality, we're encroaching on "their territory" and the idea in their mind that no, *not all people* are created equal.  That's awesome! I can't reveal my fiance or friend's gift because they're both Redditors, and of course know about me modding.I'm hoping to snag today with Petco's huge sale a few puzzle toys for Rain (keep building those skills and challenging her mind), a ton of training treats, and probably a couple other things for her Christmas that she needs/needs replaced-like a glow in the dark ball.My parents and sister/BIL will probably get custom photo gifts of some sort (sister/BIL of their dog, parents probably of Rain). They call our dogs the "granddogs" because unless my sister decides her want for a baby outweighs their busy traveling lifestyle (she's facesitting at the moment). they're the only hope of grandkids they have. (I'm not having kids because I don't want to pass on my health issues).  I'm just hoping it's now moved to a landlord vs tet dispute and the neighbors will stop focusing on us as much (though I know that we're not going to be their favorite people and still hate us).  since they're the ones who have the no-pet policy. I'm just hoping we can land upon a "live and let live, mutual ignoring" at this point. The bizarre thing is, I've only really ever interacted/talked with the kids, who are constantly outside playing. Just everyday niceties as I come and go. I've said hello to the parents when I encounter them, but they've never stopped to talk to me in the past year or so since they moved in. We were ignoring everything else already including the dog, until they made it an issue.I'm the one who is home nearly 24/7, and I'm very, very, quiet due to the fact they're so noisy. One of their complaints was they thought I *wasn't* home all day and left Rain, lol. So we're a bit baffled as to why the anger/PA started.It's about to get more drama, because they still have the puppy (their deadline was yesterday at midnight) and I was supposed to contact the landlord if it was still here. So this isn't over yet. I know! I couldn't believe when I saw your post and I was like..I have an example of that TODAY! I do not find that things are getting better, at all. Most people I talk to who have lived long enough to have a true sample size, seem to think that the last ten years have really declined for women. I hear you and I add my voice to your dissent in the "Please, fucking stop mansplaining, period." category. Just this morning, there was an argument on a (cisgender female) friend's wall on Facebook on a screencapped article comment from [this article, in which a bill is being passed in NYC to require free access to menstrual products in prison/jail, schools, and homeless shelters waiting for a signature by the mayor of NYC](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-prisons-periods_us_576bfcade4b0b489bb0c901b). It's an excellent article worth a read on it's own-but the part that got the male commenter riled up and was being argued on my friend's wall was the fact that women in prison will no longer only receive a certain amount of products. In the article, it makes the example that in one prison, per 144 inmates, the DOC provides 144 generic pads per week- 2-3 per inmate. They have to save them for their period week- so you get 10-11 pads or so per period.The male commenter on the article goes on to say *"Well that's 11 per month(cycle) which seems like a lot. Some women would be expected to need less, and it is hard to imagine many more women need more than that." Ya, rly. Male friend of said friend went on to only prove the point how out of touch men can be on the subject, when he said that the new law/requirements were merely a matter of politicians inventing facts to fit their agenda, and not an actual problem. Because you know, it's not possible we could need access to that many sanitary products or our periods could be like that. I'm sure she'll love that. I'm still currently in the "freak out and look through about 20 different websites trying to find something appropriate" for my parents, sister, and BIL. I have my best friend and fiance taken care of (if not ordered yet). To add to the complication my budget is next to nothing this year. But I'm hoping over the next couple weeks, I'll get an email with something that catches my eye. I've seen that term popping up more and more- the "alt-left." It *seems* to be aimed more at the further leftists in the party and their supporters so far- Bernie and Elizabeth Sanders fans, and anyone left of that. I've not seen it applied to Hillary so much. The above is interesting because it appears they're insisting that we live in a perfect ultra-liberal society already. (I can't type that with a straight face.) Like, we just all as a nation start pretending that Trump lost? That may just be the most brilliant, hilarious, and few appropriate uses of gaslighting ever. I'm honestly wondering if we're going to see more and more of this. The problem Trump has, is that while a good core of his voterbase is LOVING his fight against the recount...it's planted seeds of doubt in the fringe, especially with him starting to look like he's backtracking/just plain backtracking on his promises. The people who voted for him to be a "man of the people/white working class" sure as hell aren't happy with his cabinent picks right now and how Wall Street, upper crust, 1% establismenter they've been.  Good morning everyone! I hope your day is going well. Sorry, I fell asleep on all of you last night. I had had an exhausting day and then the neighbor drama was just kind of the final straw. [Linked if you don't know what I'm talking about, if you care.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hillaryclinton/comments/5g0473/roundtable_1201/daoli8x/)Anyone snag any good BlackFridayCyberMondayWeekPalooza deals?  Thank you. Like...all I wanted was to live and let live. They've been annoying as fuck with CONSTANT banging and things knocking against the walls, stereo with bass all the way turned up, and all 6 kids under 10ish who treat the apartment like a playground. We've only ever asked about turning the music down; unfortunately dealing with kids is the price you pay for apartment living.  I probably will once things settle down a bit-maybe in a week or so. That also gives me time to start my Christmas baking to actually have something to give out.  So, I don't know if any of you remember the neighbor drama I had a couple weeks ago where it looked like my neighbors were trying to get us evicted due to my service dog, and they had been found out about their against-the-lease pet in a no pets apartment (not an ESA or service animal). Turns out a disgruntled tet who got evicted for other reasons called everyone in our half of the building with dogs against the rules and told them they were getting evicted at the end of the month. With the kicker being, this disgruntled tet told them it was *our* fault the rest of them were getting evicted and I had made the report. So I found out that the neighbor's next door actually had been talking with an attorney to try and get my SD and I evicted. The mom had been trying to trap me, preferably when I had Rain a few days this week (they leave their windows open, and the kids would scream "mom, she and the dog are back, and she'd suddenly appear as I was unlocking my door). I'd managed to avoid her until yesterday. I took Rain for her usual half-block walk and when I came back, she and her 6 kids (there's 8 people in the slightly less than 1000sq foot apt) were in front of their and my door with the puppy running off leash between them, and the kids screaming "no bite". I was coming up from the alley entrance, which doesn't pass their door, so I spotted it and was able to move down the alley and was forced to call the landlord as I couldn't get into the apartment without either risking myself or her.Well, they got told that the dog has to go by the landlord-and their lawyer apparently told them that too, and they went to see the landlords right before they closed to argue it. I think the landlords gave them the same answer as thezir lawyer-legally they are in the wrong and because the woman has been arguing with the boyfriend by screaming at the top of her lungs, and there are thunks and thuds that sound like things being thrown around. So now all my neighbors hate us, and the next door ones appear to be determined to get their revenge somehow, even though the eviction notice they got was false. (And no, we really can't afford to move.) I know we're on the right side of the property managers-I've talked to them, as well as the law, but jesus I didn't need this drama or stress. I'm well aware of that, being atheist. I specified "belief system" not religion and that atheism was a lack of a belief system. However, The Pew Study included it as a "religious group" during their data, likely to simplify things. I honestly keep wondering when he'll slip up and say the "n" word. Or other racial epithets, and other horrible discriminatory slurs. Good evening everyone! I keep trying to do things for the sub (like find some news stories) and then keep getting distracted by IRL things like the dishes and the ongoing battle of the neighbors. How are you all? That is a field that is exploding, especially since the digital records mandate. I wish you the best of luck, and good job on picking a major! Honestly- I think this is one of the biggest issues overall. My heart just hurts that we call ourselves the land of the free, with all people created equal, and all citizens having the right to vote-but if you're poor, disabled, elderly, or a minority, fuck you. I hope that it does not affect your ability to get an education at all, and that you will be safe. That all of you in the sub will stay safe. What are you going to university for, if you don't mind me asking? Oops-it looks like I didn't make that clear enough, but it is what I said/intended.I was pointing out in the Pew Poll,  the discrepancy of Judaism being ranked the *most* trusted group of religious practices across the board. Trump already had preyed upon anti-Semitism crowd amongst Americans without Bernie even being his opponent, let alone in a general election, where the athiesm issue hadn't even been touched upon.  One (former) friend did a spite vote for Trump. "Let him burn it all down and we'll fix it" I had multiple (most now former friends) either not vote at all on purpose  ("my vote doesn't matter!",  "they're the same!" etc) or write in Bernie ("it's the only thing I can do *with my conscience* even though I know he won't be President), plus a few Stein voters who got booted more towards the beginning of the primaries for going nuts on my posts.  Can I add to the love of the bear (animal) and link you to the [North American Bear Center](http://www.bear.org/website/) so you all can show them some love? That town was our family's annual vacation trip (I spent age ten until I moved out in MN) and I was somewhat obsessed with the bears. I got to do a background photography tour and was able to get very close. So, so incredible and such an amazing experience.Like any wild animal, there can be danger if they've become normalized to humans in the wild, or provoked, but the black bears they have were some of the most gentle and adorable things. Reminded me of huge dogs in a lot of ways.I need to see if I still have the folder of those pics on my computer or if they're just on an external drive. Not just a socialist-but a man of Jewish heritage. Trump played lightly with the anti-Semitism crowd already. The big issue is he's an atheist by belief system (lack thereof). However, I'm sure that most of you are familiar with the Pew research study that found when the total population was polled, including atheists, on a scale from 0-100, ranked at a 41. Muslims rank at 41. Yes, Jewish is the highest but he is not a practicing Jew, he's an atheist. That fact alone, I think, would have absolutely sunk him in the general election. The Pew Study: http://www.pewforum.org/2014/07/16/how-americans-feel-about-religious-groups/ I was looking at the numbers now- I got the Ohio/NC numbers switched. I blame the fact I haven't had my coffee yet this AM. :D > I told my friend that I probably won't survive the Trump presidency one way or another and that seems like it'll hold trueI know it's not much, but I'm sending good thoughts and an e-hug your way. I cannot tell you how much my heart has been breaking for everyone in the sub because it's going to make an impact on their lives, so many of us hugely due to being in the groups of the disadvantaged. He's running scared. It just seems incredible to me that it's this close. I feel like if they do Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin...she could flip it.  I know. I'm somewhat breathing a sigh of relief on that front. I'm just hoping that they will actually stand up if Trump tries to get us into WWIII.  I meant if it exists and is verifiable-I thought that was a give in here. I should have added that.  Anyone else have the issue where if you get up and spot one thing that needs to be cleaned, it somehow leads to about 10 other things that need to be cleaned before you can sit down again? I tend to do it when I'm angry, frustrated, or anxious.  Well, I fell asleep again for about 40 minutes right after reading your comment, so I guess it's true! Wow-Had not heard that yet. I hope that comes out in the mainstream media and is blasted before the Electoral College votes. Uncertainty piled on top of every other stress I'm sure we're all carrying.  WOOO! Good luck and safe travels! Wait-sex tape of who? I said this in yesterday's roundtable- but I truly think this is a combination of the consequences of our educational system failing to build critical thinking and logic skills (instead of teaching to tests), as well as a lack of value placed on the pursuit of knowledge and intellectualism.  Well, I guess the joke was on me-I promptly passed out asleep in the recliner after saying hello at 4:15am PST this am. At least I didn't sleep post anything! Well, joke was on me. I fell asleep in the recliner after posting, lol. In lighthearted fluff news: Apparently, the creator of the Big Mac died today. *Jim Delligatti, 98, was a McDonald's franchisee in Pennsylvania who a half-century ago created what became perhaps the world's best-known fast-food sandwich.* Good morning everyone!!! I hope your day is off to a good start. It's 4:15am here and I can't sleep so I figured I'd drop in for a bit before trying to sleep again. How is everyone? I just can't give up yet. I refuse. I'm way, way too stubborn for that. There are dusty onions in this room, I swear. That means so, so much to me. I do not get out and travel much, but I will be certain to let you know. I have always wanted to go there, and it would be a very pretty flight or car trip from SoCal. I have a wonderful team of doctors who do a pretty good job managing my care on the day to day. Unfortunately, when I need emergency care or a hospitalization, they have been not so stellar. Hahaha-You did not gross me out at all. With my severe medical issues, I've been through and seen and done some pretty strange things come out of my own body alone. My laughter at the weirdness was lot of people would realize that transfusion=energy, and you just kind of blatantly asked and I don't immediately see context in the queue. So it was funny. :D That is one of the weirder things that came through modqueue... Thankfully I get your point if it was a little bit weirdly stated.  Popular vote= popular vote across America. No state or counties would matter more than others, each American would have one vote and they would all weight equally. A guy in Middle of Nowhere, Iowa, would have the same weight as people  *hugs* I've had major depressive disorder for 20 years of my life now. (I got it very, very young w/ suicidal intentions in the mix). I was there on Election Night after the point of no return came back. I had already been dealing with a major downswing the past 6 months due to the fact my physical medical situation is so terrible, so I almost hit the very rock bottom. That's why I disappeared for a few days. I had to deal with the shock to the system before I could stand up and say I was going to keep going. Especially since unless CA gets it's shit together and keeps some sort of exchange together, once the Republicans destroy the ACA and the patient protections, it starts the countdown clock to me dying. Thankfully my psychiatrist was able to do some But I just can't think about that. I refuse that I am going to have that reality come to be and I'm going to keep going to spite Trump and his supporters on this as well as be here for you guys.  I'm pretty sure the admins were just waiting for an excuse.  I don't know if this was anyone else's experience but I know I saw them often, especially at rest stops and that. Made for some awkward family road trips when I was a kid and wanted to know what some of the graffiti said. I could read it, just didn't know what the words were/what they meant my parents were ultra strict and Christian when it came to what we were allowed to say (they'd have preferred we didn't even *think* about or know them). Basically, nothing stronger than a "darn" or "shoot" was tolerated until after I turned 18...then I might have gotten away with "shit" once in a while. Anything stronger and there was hell to pay. I still get the occasional phone call when I use "fuck" on Facebook and she accidentally sees (from me commenting on a friend's post) despite the fact I have her on a restricted list. :P Don't you know we've just got millions upon millions taking advantage here in CA? /s Ah-I totally misunderstood you. Sorry about that. It was Froot Loops. I don't eat cereal anymore, though.  That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.  Also approaching this from a different, more specific perspective: You do realize that each and every Trump voter either voted for (or it was not a deal breaker issue) the ADA to be destroyed, MILLIONS to lose their only insurance, people to lose protection with preexisting conditions, and the big one:  To watch a large segment of those insured as well as the general American population DIE because of that legislation being withdrawn and their vote for Trump. And no, that's not an exaggeration, a figure of speech, or a lie. Every single person who voted for Trump is complicit in those deaths. As well as at LEAST being OK and having it not be a dealbreaker the fact that he's a narcissistic, racist, misogynist, sexist, ableist liar. Or they're ACTIVELY one or more of those things themselves. We don't take the degradation, let alone the full blown death sentence of our fellow Americans very lightly.   As someone down here in the SoCal area-I really hope they don't. Though my experience is with their health system (and the teaching hospital). The last group of residents they brought in to specifically baffle when I was there were Redditors. That was a really fun intertwining of reality and Reddit and gave me a laugh.  I know that in some ways, it is petty-but as long as they're being peaceful, to me there's an argument to be made for exercising their right to peaceful protest. I mean-Hillary does deserve some love after the election, and goodness knows America needs as much Love and Kindness with President Trump on the way.As much as I disagreed/despised some of the motivations, I acknowledged that most of the people who gathered in 2008 & 2012  had the *right* (even though they were very very wrong, and in most cases racist) to protest. The people who reacted violently, I do not condone. It is clear that peaceful protest is what is protected. (This is not to say that police brutality against protesters is not an issue, however.)  I'm really glad I know you as a regular so I don't take that seriously, lol.  Pretty much, not to mention it can stoke his ego that much bigger. I'm wondering if you took off his tie, would his head deflate like the counselor in South Park? WOO! \o/ :( I'm so sorry. As much as it's important to be seen by a professional who can get you on the right ones, I really wish we had speedier/better mental healthcare in this country.  Bahahahaha-That's even better! It's not all bad...my sister and BIL live there. They're Hillary supporters!  I had no idea that Kellog's even advertised on Breitbart in the first place. But maybe this will create an exodus of advertising money from them. I tend to agree with you-I think Bill's opinion should have been weighted more heavily than Mook's. I love Mook as a person (and his social media was wonderful) but in retrospect, he (or someone in the same position) probably should have been more aggressive.  I always welcome discussion-I never claim to be 100% right on any issue. :) One of the things I love about being in the sub is how many different sides of things I get exposed to.  Good evening everyone!!!! I hope you are doing excellently. I do not know how anyone can say Hillary was not the pick or will of the people when she is set to surpass Obama's 2012 numbers. No matter what happens with the recounts and the Electoral College- we know she is President in our hearts and minds. We really accomplished something great, guys. <3  Because they thought he was the embodiment and help for "working class America." The running his mouth is for the benefit of his userbase. He knows very well that there was no mass voting fraud by undocumented immigrants.  Like...every time I think it can't keep getting worse, it does. With my health issues and 9/11- W symbolized a lot of that for me even though I was much younger and couldn't vote. It just changed EVERYTHING. We went from "love your fellow neighbor" to "be suspicous of them if they're a minority." Then the horrors of the War in Afghanistan, and later Iraq were all over the Nightly News and in the Time and Newsweek we got every week-all of which I had been consuming since I could remember and read (though not always grasp the content). I remember Obama's speech at the DNC that made me think "he's going places and might be president." But I wanted Hillary. I wore my "A Woman Belongs in The Oval Office" button and caught so much shit during the campaigning when I was still too young to vote. (My birthday was only a couple months before Election Day) People thought just because I couldn't vote, I wasn't entitled to an opinon, either on the candidate I WOULD be voting for, or on W himself. I fought for Hillary in in the primaries against Obama, and I don't regret it. But once he secured it, I turned to 100% team Obama, with hopes he would tap her for a cabinet position. When it was SOS, I was THRILLED. I thought, FINALLY a woman would get some respect as she showed that she could do the job just the same, if not better than a man. I am very proud to have called Obama my president. I think he is a wonderful person, if not always quite the best politician for the complete deadlock due to his kindness. I hope he will continue to have an enormous positive impact like Jimmy Carter does. I'm still not going to give up on Hillary yet, until everything is finalized and Trump is sworn in. I just can't. She has fought too hard, and too long, for us to quit on her. I'm not going to quit on her no matter what she decides to do with the rest of her life. Because even just everything up to now has been noteworthy and made history. I am not going to let people forget that. It was a general comment on the idea Hillary hadn't outreached enough to the white working class: *LOL at the idea that Hillary "did not communicate that American's concerns were heard and were appreciated." Look at her entire fucking platform. It was ALL aimed at benefitting everyone BUT the rich guys. Most of the people railing against her never even read her plans because they were busy not thinking and listening to sound bites and blatant lies about her history or positions instead of her ACTUAL positions. Furthermore, the DNC has ALWAYS been for the working class, and Democrats have an enormous history of supporting the working class.**Which, honestly, the word working class is somewhat a misnomer and doesn't provide any helpful description. If you take it as it is it's anyone who works at all. No difference between "blue collar" or "white collar" (which many jobs are a mix of these days due to increasing technology innovations).**If you break it into blue collar and white collar workers, you're going to find that you can find equivalent salaries and benefits in both now because of how little of a value bachelor's degree has (yay reality of student debt) unless you're in some specific fields like STEM.**Not to mention, all of the hoopla of Donald Trump "bringing back the manufacturing and factories from other countries and bringing back jobs" is nothing but a nice idea that is impossible. For one a majority of those jobs are gone because mechanical replaced physical labor. Robots and other machines can do things with precision, strength, and speed far beyond a human. Also, it's cheaper. It's simply just cheaper in these other countries due to lack of environmental regulations, lower wages (often inhumanly low), and allows them to run around tax laws. Until we close the tax loopholes, they won't consider staying but that's the jobs that currently exist. The ones that have been lost are NEVER coming back.**Returning to the misnomer that is "working class." It would be much more accurate to not divide them into blue and white, but rather economic situation. Instead of working class, we'd now have "working without govt. assistance," and "working with govt. assistance (now called the working poor in most cases)"**So the hierarchy would go: 1%, upper class, middle class, working w/o assistance, working with assistance.**However, this ignores the most unprivileged classes of all. Yes, going from bottom to top, ALL of these groups have some degree of privilege because they *can* work. People who can work but choose not to have privilege both for being able to work and being able to choose not to, just for the record, even if it's to be a stay at home parent.**The next to last, where the line of privilege begins to end, is those relying solely on assistance to survive-overwhelmingly the disabled who cannot function on an everyday basic level, the elderly, and kids who often have life-altering disabilities, or there is not enough food or adequate medical care.) The overwhelming majority have very little to no possibility of improving their situation.**The last, with no ficial privilege at all- the homeless, those who honestly can't work due to disability but get denied due to the difficulties in the process, the unemployed who have run out of options. Under-18's in abusive situations in no way out (or older people who cannot get out due to being incapable). I'm sure I'm missing several situations or groups here, but the lowest of the low, the people who have NO way to improve their situation.**Hillary's America would have been a huge uplift for pretty much all but the 1% of America. All of this information was available on her website and in her speeches.**Specifically, among my friend's group, I watched people who I thought were intelligent until now pass on and preach the false allegations and accusations. I watched them claim the primary was rigged and stolen from Bernie somehow. I watched them trash her up until the week before the election and then the majority be "oh shit" and switch to praising her. Of the remaining about 30% said they were going to write in vote Bernie and 1 voted for Stein. Because "their votes didn't matter."****Hillary Clinton did not fail. She didn't fail to communicate. She was not a deeply flawed candidate.*** *Eevery "scandal" has been debunked. The American people failed to listen because they were too busy listening to, dulling their brains, and being shocked by the antics of Donald Trump. He used the same tactics he would on his reality show to keep people watching, with no content. And a minority (popular vote count, remember) bought into it because they never stopped to THINK and engage their brains.**It's a step away from Idiocracy.* The very term "white working class is a misnomer in itself, however-they're still enormously privileged and don't recognize that. I disagree that it needs catering specifically to, as much as just inclusion.I need to finish up something, but I want to dig up a post of mine shortly after the election.  It is indeed. We also have the downvote brigade out in force today, I see. Actually, despite being a presidential re-election, Jimmy Carter and Ted Kennedy are pretty good comparison to this election.  Well, that's a very complex answer that lies somewhere in the failings of our educational system, as well as the reduced capacity that a large America has for critical thinking and logic skills outside of general education, plus the lack of value placed on intellectualism and the pursuits of knowledge.  Awwwww. Did you guys see the photos from the White House holiday decorating with Bo and Sunny? [Washington Post, so open in Incognito](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/see-photos-of-the-white-house-for-the-obamas-last-holiday-celebration/2016/11/29/9209f7ea-b660-11e6-a677-b608fbb3aaf6_gallery.html?utm_term=.cac46a4d5398) I LOVE all the Lego! :D Note, he says *appearance" of conflicts, not actual conflicts. I like your dream better.  Especially when he admits they're sitting in on his meetings as President.  Yep. Kamala Harris and Loretta Sanchez were both popular picks, even though Loretta Sanchez had much more baggage. Not to mention, Kamala is very, very well loved here. That, or someone has decided to quit their job in a spectacular fashion. Please tell me he won't hook his Twitter account up.  Hey, that IS a great piece of news. The NYT seems determined not to let Trump be normalized, so I hope that everyone will keep supporting it.  Good morning everyone! I hope your day is going well. Well, Trump really showed us how much Goldman Sachs is an issue and how anti-establishment he is with his latest pick for the Secretary of the Treasury. I must admit, seeing that this morning, that made me angry at the protest voting all over again. WHY.  Once again, I do not understand how people do not get the incredible sense of warmth she has about her.  Good evening all! I hope you are having a wonderful day. I'm sorry for vanishing, not being able to sleep last night caught up to me and I passed out sitting up in the recliner until now. It looks like the trolls have been playing a bit while I've been away, so give me a few minutes to clean things up. Please report anything you see.  Medi-Cal is the CA equivalent of Medicaid. :)  Thank you fluffy. :) We try our best. (I'm biased, obviously) But I think we have one of the best userbases on reddit. You guys are the reason the sub is amazing. I will amend that positive things may be said, but honestly, guys he's a kid. He doesn't have control over his parent's behavior, nor does he have the ability to consent to any of this. It's flat out hypocritical of us to have wanted and fought for Chelsea, Malia & Sasha to be left alone, and not allowing the same for his minor child. Nor is it EVER acceptable to speculate on if a minor child has a mental condition, that's ableism. It is also not only ableism, but discrimination and demeaning to say being on the spectrum is a bad thing, or that anyone with it is a "poor" anything.We go high, people. We go high. Well, as a Californian, I am happy to be a thorn in his side. :D  That's better than the normalization of Trump that has been trending.  That sounds like it could be fun! I lost my video games when I switched to a Macbook Air in August and haven't been able to afford to replace or get anything since. So hence my obsessive Redditing.  Honestly, I can't focus on it. I have to think short term what can I do today, the next month, to keep going. Plan for the best case scenario where I can still get insurance, and if the worst comes, then I'll deal with it, because there will be minimal I can do. It's just accepting that your life is in the hands of such incompetent people who absolutely do not care about the loss of life or people involved, just the dollars and business, that is most difficult. Not to mention the fact that almost half the people that voted in the country do not find people like me dying a dealbreaker-including members of my extended family.  Never underestimate the impact you have had. :) As you can see-thread has been locked and removed. My point from last week still stands, and I will be keeping a sharper eye out. We have some regulars taking a break until the EC. Others have been so appreciative of the community still being here and being an island of sanity in a sea of crazy. Also: #***resounding applause*** She's also evolved in her position since then...you know, like a smart person does when more information becomes available. ...Oh my god, I can't unsee. That's what I've been doing. I think they're getting sick of me.  Note from the mods: Baron is off-limits, as well as abelism being 100% against the rules of the subreddit (R2:Offensive Content) Anyone speculating about him being on the spectrum, or anything else, will be placed on a temporary ban. This is the only warning that will be given. We do not attack children. Nor is being on the spectrum a bad thing. I'm not sure everyone is getting the sarcasm in the final sentence. :) Also, Hillary was never charged and the investigations fournd no wrongdoing on her part. So she's not even in the same LEAGUE as Petraeus.  Good afternoon everyone! I have returned after four hours of sleep. How are all of you doing? I find the fact about Trump not having thrown a post-victory press conference very interesting. Especially after how hard he ragged on Hillary about not holding press conferences. To me, that signals that he thinks there's an actual possibility he *won't* be the actual president.  I often find myself singing that in the morning. Small benefit of being alone in an apartment all day, no one cares if you turn your day into a musical. :D <3 You're welcome. Comments like this mean the world to me. We all work very hard to keep this a civil, safe environment for productive discussion, as well as fostering a tight-knit sense of community.  Yes. They really have no other lives. We will keep banning and zapping them as they try and come. You live in a non-community property state. The ring is hers.As another poster pointed out below the payout is equivalent to her selling the ring, and that money is HERS as it is NOT considered a marital asset. So yes, there's absolutely legal precedent here. She also has zero obligation or expectation to wait until the kids are grown to file, either. Good morning everyone! The insomnia gremlins came out to play last night so I figured I'd just come be on here for a while. I may step away in a bit to try and sleep again. The dog is not happy with me, at all.  I totally misread that as "I still need constipation" and did an IRL "wide eye, jerk head back, Wait, WHAT?" Nowhere did I say "his feelings would get hurt." I said he will almost certainly damage his HEALTH, especially MENTAL HEALTH, taking care of her in their shared apartment watching her decline until she dies. Caregiving is *extremely stressful* when there is severe illness involved, let alone a terminal case. Second you really need to stop discounting his feelings and love for your sister. You're acting like this guy is a stranger she met a week ago and just naively signed the papers to make him her proxy. I signed my Advanced Directive/Living Will naming my proxy under touch and go illness in the hospital, giving control to my fiance over my parents. You're required to talk to MULTIPLE people (the doctors, social worker, etc), alone, to make sure you're not being pressured into putting down someone against your will. My fiance wasn't even allowed in the room until I had filled out the form and it just needed his signature. He LOVES her and has been in a relationship with her for 3 years. He cares enough to stick with her even though she's dying, and manage her care. He's not just going to "work and TV." You're letting your anger over the fact your sister is dying both cloud your mind as well as attack the person your sister loved and accepted, who could really use some working as a team/family in carrying out her wishes instead of trying to attack him and bring in lawyers. I also never said that people should die alone in the hospital. She would not be alone-I am sure he would be there as much as he could, and you and your parents would not be barred from visiting (unless you keep up this behavior of attacking him, and he may have to ask for security). The hospital hospice or a skilled facility is the best place for HER as well as HIM, her caregiver. She can receive around the clock care, pain management, attention, and doctor's visits. Yes, you can get home health hospice nurses but they do not/will not have the resources available to fully keep your sister comfortable, nor be able to intervene if something goes wrong.  Fucking insomnia gremlins caught me, so I figured the best use of my time was coming back here until I got sleepy. Now that it's slow, I don't feel bad sharing this: I got what is probably one of the more deplorable yet tame (meaning no threats or anything) PMs from a troll today. "Whiny Autist" Which, I indeed found out a year and a half ago as an adult I'm solidly on the spectrum. (It's a long story on why it wasn't diagnosed in childhood/young adulthood due to parents, but there was abuse and control involved.) It's not really hurtful because I don't see myself as whiny nor do I consider being on the spectrum a bad thing at all. When I was finally given a formal diagnosis (I had suspicions since age 13 or so) it felt more like an enormous relief than anything-I wasn't broken or just an endless fuck up socially and at certain innate social norms and intricacies, no matter how hard I practiced or tried so I wouldn't mess up next time.  GO YOU!!!!!! Your therapist/psychiatrist (if you have one), pastor/clergy, current and former professors, your current program advisor at the college, anyone in your department program who you've worked with/taken classes from/know, etc, your doctors, family members, family friends, previous landlords.  Except that's not why that money appeared. That money is a direct insurance payment for her stolen engagement ring. It's in both your names because you're on the policy together, but that is HER MONEY. It's not yours to decide what it should go to, as it's not a marital asset.  The thing is, I'm not sure the wife is 100% on this plan if she cares enough to replace the ring.  I would write papers over toddler+baby combo any day. :D GO YOU! GO GO GO! *enthusiastic dancing* "Fuck you, I got mine." And are you thinking of his own health, especially his mental health? He's been in a relationship with your sister for three years. That may not be permanent, but that's a significant period of time. Now he's watching her die in front of him, and your sister trusted him enough to appoint him her proxy (as well as own property)-which means she literally *trusts him with her life.* Not only would he then be expected to take 24/7 care of her (which unless you have special training in hospice care and experience, NO ONE is prepared for), majorly impacting him physically, but that would *destroy* anyone mentally. There would be no relaxation and no break time, it would be sitting around watching the love of his life dying. Not to mention what would happen *after* she dies he then has to live in the apartment for however long remains in the lease, reminded every second that this is the place she died. It is incredibly selfish to expect him to destroy his own health and safety in the process of caring for your sister. He is trying to do what is best for *both* of them. The fact is-they're going to be able to keep her much more comfortable in a hospital or hospice facility than at home. People would be there whenever she needs something, her pain would always be controlled, and the doctors would be available if something happened. Please consider the health of the caregiver and in this case the love of your sister's life before you make his life hell by trying to take proxy away by force. Three years is a strong relationship. It doesn't matter how "official" it was.  *flails arms* YOU CAN DO IT! Yes! My fiance and I were both suprised at how clever and funny it was. It was worth the few bucks we paid for it. We have Secret Life of Pets that we'll watch when we have time next. I've heard so many good things about it, and you know I'm a sucker for animals. :D  It still amazes, and enrages me, that people do not realize that the ACA going away will mean a *literal* death sentence for a subset of Americans with severe issues.' From a non-legal perspective- this just seems insane. She wants 2 years of the house bankrolled by you, alimony, AND child support? Child support is obviously non-negotiable. The alimony+you having to pay the mortgage on a house you can't use is crazy (though from the comment here, seemingly legal). Was she working while you were married at all? Does she have marketable job skills or a job lined up?  That just seems like a VERY short end of the deal-I mean he's basically still being her husband ficially, except now he's actually divorced and recieving no benefit from the marriage. Ok, I laughed quite heartily at that description. It's close enough to the truth.  The thing is- the majority of poor white Americans do not view themselves as poor, and despite receiving the benefits, they then go on to vote against their own interests. Especially when tied into the systemic racism, and the false stereotypes of other people receiving government benefits. Basically, *they* deserve it, but everyone else doesn't and is mooching off the system. Those *other* recipients are drug users/dealers, selling Food Stamps, *insert false racial stereotype,* having kids just to stay in the system, totally faking being disabled and just need to be more bootstrappy, parents who just need to get another job or work harder to feed their kids, because it's "not the government's job." It's honestly very, very depressing and sad that they don't see themselves as part of that community of low-income people, actually. Because if they stopped voting against their own interests and lobbied for them, it would probably be enough to actually change things for the better for them and all of the people they currently consider below them. I think the point is, there are many who *won't* survive who didn't vote for Trump at all. They do not deserve the death sentence that they are getting. My city has a lot of the low rent/high rent next to each other, and about half the shops are old and need remodeling, and half are remodeled already. It's basically as one business fails/moves/gets cash to remodel, the downtown is getting a facelift. :D Good for her!!! It's going to mean that much more to her because of the hard work.  You absolutely needed to do what is best for you. I so agree he hasn't done anything for us. Other than be annoying. I am one who won't survive if it goes away (unless CA decides/succeeds in making it work on a state level on their own but the patient protections I need will no longer be there, like no lifetime cap.). I'm honestly trying not to think about it as there's so little I can do other than push for the recount/Electoral College efforts, write my governor and state reps, and hope. It's just so hard knowing that at any time in the next four years, all it would take would be 2 votes and a signature and I'd have so little time left. Congratulations to your little sister! Huge accomplishment and she should be very proud. I hope it brings many opportunities to her. Congratulations! That's a huge accomplishment and something to be proud of. It also will look great on college applications and may open up some job opportunities too right now. Generally, students who are on the Student Council take things pretty seriously and don't get into trouble, and people are a bit more likely to hire you for more than burger flipping. You shattered your own glass ceiling. :)  \o/  YAY! YOU CAN DO THE THING! WE BELIEVE IN YOU.  I just can't imagine if he's allowed to keep tweeting like this through the presidency. What's he going to do, tweet-tantrum every time a foreign leader or dignitary disagrees with him and publicly mock them? EXACTLY.  That's a good idea, too. I have not! I'll check there now. The "logic" I am seeing is "it's ok because Hillary had the emails." Stepping aside from politics: Why the hell is it so fucking hard to find a medium sized women's cross-body purse that A) doesn't cost a ridiculous amount, B) won't fall apart immediately, and C) doesn't look ridiculous? (I'm really not aiming for a upscale designer knockoff here. I want a basic purse.) Yes-I had to correct that. I had seen an earlier report in the day.  A significant amount, actually.  I have mine up still on my bulletin board, and my H symbol with a heart pin still on my purse strap. I refuse to take it off. I am going to be the embodiment of Hillary's America, no matter what.  Well, it wouldn't be the first time that was heavily suspected to have occurred . (Hello Bush vs Gore in FL and the "hanging chads" scandal) Unfortunately, no concrete proof, just logical suspicion and possibility.  I watched MSNBC theough the Election, but once the normalization started after, I've all but stopped. My TV time is almost exclusively stuff that is stress relief-The Simpsons especially (I hadn't watched ANY episodes ever until a few months ago. So they're al new to me!). I also like Bar Rescue, COPS, iZombie, Criminal Minds, NCIS, Game of Thrones and the new Westworld is pretty good. I keep hope my something new will catch my eye, or something new to me on Netflix. (Waiting on the next season of House of Cards) Fucking dammit. It looks like Darryl Issa is going to hold onto his position by the seat of his pants. >:| We were so close to getting rid of him.  I fucking hate having him as my rep. Applegate doesn't go down without a fight, though, and with a 2.3k gap, I'' betting a recount will be had.  Good evening everyone! I hope your day is going well. How are you all? I can/can't believe we had another public ~~shooting~~. Stabbing. Unfortunately, ~~the suspect appears to be middle eastern~~. Sorry guys, the earlier report I saw got his background incorrect. He is indeed Somali. Still is worst timing ever, just now with the racism and white nationalism Trump has brought about. Oh, I know. It's just that the claim of a popular vote allowing CA or NY to decide is bullshit. Or any other state, for that matter. The Electoral College gives certain states so much more enormous power.  Yep. He's been a *horrible* governor for Wisconsin and is just a terrible person and politician in general.  Oh, I agree-hence the lawsuit attempt. I'm not pinning all my hopes on it or saying it will happen, just saying that would be what is most needed.  I actually think a hand recount is exactly what is needed to see if there are discrepancies and invalid ballots. You're not going to find most just running them through the machines again.  That sounds like a paper worth reading! :)  I have no idea how I kept staring at that with the comments and didn't realize I said Post instead of Times (meaning Times). I apologize. I just had to majorly face palm at myself that despite the helpful comments from everyone, I didn't notice I said Washington Post instead of Times, when I absolutely meant Times.  I am also impressed! This is such a huge but simple thing of internet etiquette and it makes me smile when people make sure.  Oh, absolutely. I mean, just look at how much criticism Michelle Obama has gotten the past 8 years over every little detail. I mean, they compare her to a cow and demean her with that nickname.  It's true that the TImes is more partisan, but I didn't expect them to stoop THAT low. The Times is certainly more twoards the gold standard though.  Do you feel like you need a shower now?  Wow. My support of the EDIT: Wahington TImes (I have no idea how I kept reading this and didn'5 see I used the wrong newspaper name despite your helpful comments.) just plummeted with one of their latest articles (not linking because it's appalling) with the title "Hillary Clinton, sore loser, perpetuates America's Divide by joining recount efforts." I expect so much better from them. Way to be misleading. I seriously don't understand how taking the TOTAL of all the states, a true popular vote, would give any state an advantage. Everyone's vote would be the same.  GOOD. I hope she and the Clinton campaign do. I think every Electoral College voter got a copy yesterday or today, if I recall correctly.  That's wonderful.  Good afternoon everyone!!! I'm sorry for the later drop in-I had an appointment this AM as well as some chores and things to take care of. How are all of you doing? I feel like Dec 19th can't get here soon enough, but at the same time it needs to be longer for people to keep calling, writing, and organizing for both the Electoral College and recount efforts.  Hey-you need to remove the link-the copy-paste is fine. You're giving away your identity on the public forum. I don't want anything to happen to you because of it. I'll reapprove it once it's removed. Your son is 2. He has very small, fragile bones and fingers. VS a very large, heavy door, EVEN with perfectly functioning hydraulics, the weight alone of the door would do the damage you describe. You're thinking of how it would affect an adult hand/finger. R2-No offensive usernames.  Oh, we have trolls of all types. After a few tweaks, automod and we mods are just keeping up a bit better now. :D His website says "freelance writer and journalist." He writes for Texas Monthly, too. It looks like he put(s) out a lot of good information about the election/aftermath in easily digestible chunks, and people may have just started following him for that and it exploded? They may be saying that now, but I'm willing to bet a LOT of them have their tune change after 4 years of Trump.  That's what I thought, but my memory of that part of the Election law was slightly fuzzy, so I figured SOMEONE here would know more than I. The power of collective thinking. :)  Now you're making me want to make a Baked Brie with Strawberry Sauce. You know, I'm not sure. I would assume they could only pick people who were on the final ballot.  Unfortunately, yes. Congrats! Getting a major post is fun. :)  Why are people so shitty??? I'm so sorry that this happened to you. :( You certainly don't deserve it. Did you freeze your credit so no more accounts can be opened? Then yeah, police report so you can document it wasn't you, so you're not liable for the charges. As far as the IRS and the SSN, they'll probably advise you to file for a change in SSN. Once that's compromised with the level of info they seem to have, it's pretty much the only way. Plus then it can prevent anything new from happening. I've only dealt with a scare, but my parents (well, my mom) had someone steal her identity similarly. Lot of hassle and work, but it worked out in the end. Given they said they had a 2+ foot thick file on him in opposition, I really don't think he would have fared well. I also think once they pulled the atheist card (especially with his Jewish heritage and Trump's base), he would have been a goner.  We have the full spectrum of liberalism here in our userbase. As long as it doesn't break the rules and is related to Hillary, the Election aftermath, recount/Electoral College efforts, Democrats & the future of the party, and Dem Allies the content is allowed. Otherwise yes, it's off-topic.  Oh shit! I'm so sorry that happened. How bad is it? I'm looking through the front page- the stories featuring the people in question all directly relate to Hillary & the election (Chomsky), the recount movement (Stein), or abolishing the Electoral College (Sanders). You're always welcome to submit content you would like to see. Direct Hillary news has been a little hard to come by since she's below the radar right now, which is why you may see an uptick in posts about or from Democrats and Democratic allies, or criticism of Trump. I'm hoping that changes in the next couple days. I mean has there ever been precedent or is that even possible with the laws we have, theoretically? I'm hoping that ~~if~~ once he's inaugurated, someone will be managing the Twitter account besides him personally. Making sure to edit things a bit. <3 Well, the sub isn't going anywhere as long as there's interest and activity. I hear you so much. This is not my America. This is not the America I have been proud a citizen of, proud to be patriotic, proud to live in the greatest country in the world despite the flaws we had. It's honestly shaken me pretty deeply, because I thought we were so much better than this. Had come so much farther than this as a society. This is regression. Honestly, there's some parallels with the religious based oppression with some radicalized Islamist sects that they rail against so badly. You all are also stuck with me permanently. Which may or may not be a good thing, depending on your personal opinion. :D Hey-if you censor that word I'll re-approve the comment. Right now it falls under R2, and we don't spread that kind of language on our site. Ok, here's a fun one. What buzzword(s) or other overused words to do with the election are you most tired of? Off the top of my head, yuge and optics are biggies for me. The thing is-I'm REALLY hoping that no one takes advantage of Trump being so nonchalantant about national security (he's been turning away the intelligence briefings ffs). A large scale attack could cause his approval ratings to soar, because he'd just bomb EVERYTHING to smithereens and ask questions later. Wouldn't matter if there were civilians or anything valuable in his way. Just look at how he talked about it during the primary debates. I hope you guys don't mind me submitting a bunch of articles today. Sunday is usually slower, and I'm finding a bunch of material that hasn't been used that is interesting/relevant. It looks like the trolls are being the downvote brigade again on anything that remotely criticizes Trump or encourages any activism against him. :P  I just sent a series of tweets at Hillary. I know there's a fraction of a percent chance she would read them...but I felt like I had to. I had to try and tell her that we're all here for her.  It would be impossible for that type of voter fraud on that scale. I mean, you still have to go through the registration process, which requires a SSN.  Where are people trying to claim they sit around and do nothing? The CA election officials have some of the hardest work laid out for them with the number of ballots. (Lives in CA) I think we can manage a sticky post on the first of December listing charities with high ratings for easy access. People can save the post for reference. Most charities have the option to send a card if you donate in honor of someone and if not, you can always just print it and put it in a nice Christmas card from the store.  Out of all of them-about 20 or so, I can probably think of 2 or 3 that would actually have the fortitude to stand up in person to defend another person being harassed, the point of the safety pin movement. The issue is, they won't even stand up on the internet.  I am just horrified and appalled at what is going on there and the lack of coverage.  I don't condone violence as the answer, but I agree that minority groups, women, the disabled, etc, especially must not just "get over it." I know I'm sure as hell not going to. Of course, you're entitled to your opinion on the path you think is appropriate. It does merit investigation. I don't want to get ahead with the unproven theories too much. The fact he's freaked out this much makes me feel like he actually thinks there's a chance he's in danger, though. Anyone else still not satisfied because we haven't seen his taxes? Yep. I only had a few third party voters, but I did have a good number of BernieOrBust friends. They're horrified at what's happening, but they won't do anything about it, other than wearing a safety pin.  That sub is honestly so bad. I can't even visit there. I think no matter no many mods they have, they just can't keep up-if they want to. It's been heavily pro-Trump since the primaries. Can you say delusional? The gubernatorial races are often overlooked-but right now they hold a huge majority and that's a major problem.  Oh, I know. I was just throwing out a thought I had. :)  I don't think placing him in a position of higher power is the answer though. Voting him out in the next election though? ABSOLUTELY. I think that's definitely a downballot race we need to focus on. Honestly, I'm glad that he wasn't picked for Trumps VP pick. It may be one of the only choices worse than Pence. He's set Wisconsin back by years, not to mention what he's done to minorities and women. Yep. I'm never going to give up hope. As long as I'm still breathing, I'm going to be the fucking annoying ray of sunshine of hope in their side. :D He's such a bomb waiting to go off. Which is why I'm so scared about our foreign policy.  Wow, that's an excellent deal. Thanks for posting about it.  As long as there is a sliver of hope, I'm not giving up. I just can't. I'm not pinning all my hopes on it, or saying it will absolutely happen, but I just have to hope as long as there is a chance. Hazelnut Chocolate Chip or Honey Fleur De Lys  *crosses fingers* Vote for the will of the people. The popular vote says the people wanted Hillary. Well, yes, that is true too. I'm beginning to wonder if there will be any moderate Republicans left in the coming years. I'm not sure what we can do, at this point, without further turning Russia against us and antagonizing them to continue the cyberattacks, ect, that have been going on.  Everyone has a right to their opinion.  You know who I want, as much as it is a dynasty? Jeb! He was the most moderate up there. Which is why people hated him. But I would honestly take another Bush presidency over this. Honestly? It's a mix of enormous determination not to let hate win and keep this a good place for our subscribers, the fact that I truly care about all of you, and I honestly just love doing this. It definitely gets frustrating at times, but the good outweighs the bad by far.  You're welcome! I try and keep the queue clear at all times. Ah! I understand the frustration. On some of the nastier and more clueless modmail we get, it is VERY hard to maintain the professionality standard I hold myself to. Not quite trolling, but rather correcting them on their incorrect facts. The most annoying is the "but my FREEDOM OF SPEECH." Which, you know, only applies to the government trying to suppress or make laws to suppress a person's speech, not a private entity like reddit or a subreddit moderating comments against the rules of the sub. Keep reporting them and they will be removed and taken care of. This sub will not tolerate trolling.  Good morning everyone!!!!  How is everyone doing? Recovered from Turkey Day comas and forced family gatherings?I cannot believe there is not some rule that Trump cannot profit from the Secret Service staying in Trump tower. He may have "rejected" the Presidental salary, but he's going to MORE than make up for it with this alone and other side things like this. Like having any foreign dignitaries and their entourages stay in Trump hotels, etc. Which of course, with all the security required to protect Trump AND any visitors will cost the taxpayers billions over his presidency. I feel like his motivation for running was partly to make guaranteed money that doesn't have a chance of failing and having to bankrupt.  Now that is a impressive twisting of cognitive dissoce. YMMV as in "everyone can have their own opinion."  It has disturbed me how the crimes and human rights violations he committed in Cuba have been absent from any of the articles I've seen about his death.  I can't say I *miss* him, but I would prefer him over Trump. I actually think W as a person, not a president, is probably actually a pretty decent guy. He was just so, so woefully unprepared for the job of president he signed up for, and it showed. Family name/grooming can't do everything.  With the campaign stepping in with the recounts, I'm *hoping*/predicting she will begin to make some public appearances again. She deserved some time to deal, though. Especially with the news now that the election may not have been 100% clean. Except there's so many of us fighting back. It's not over yet. Well, it absolutely seems that way to me. She's hiding from the spotlight as much as she can, she doesn't want to live in the White House, she pretty much didn't campaign at all for him, and she doesn't have an agenda laid out for being First Lady. Every interview I've seen her talking about it, she seems sad and like she's just having to accept a position she didn't want. *shrugs* YMMV Ugh. Honestly, I feel sorry for her in the fact that is so clear she absolutely does NOT want to be in a position like First Lady.  That's their official statement, but honestly, can they say anything different without feeding the hate machine more? Good evening everyone! Sorry for being absent most of the day-today was my belated Thanksgiving with the future-in laws and my fiance. How is everyone doing? You would not believe the cheer I let out when I heard the Clinton campaign is joining the WI recount effort. She's going to fight! :D  I'd agree for many of the same reasons, though I can't speak Russian. Putin is also highly patterned in his behavior-and nothing is done without reason and thought. Trump is a bomb waiting to go off.Edit: I'm sorry about your family and friends. I hope they remain safe. Ok, I did have to lol at this. That's a fair point. Crazier things have happened here. I mean, we had the neighbor who painted the spite house. Hmm. I could see him getting off the ground locally but I don't think he ever got enough name recognition or support within the party for it to truly take off as a splinter cell. But hey, the Tea Party Republicans happened.   It's sad when the thought of that event seems amusing compared to what we are facing now, though I do not wish to return to a Bush presidency either.  If not friends, they are at least being allies-nuclear weapon bearing allies. That's his long game on that one, I think. There's no question he's always wanted more power and for Russia to be #1. Putin seems to subscribe to the mindset of "friends with no one, but opportunistic allies with those who advantage him." Like Trump. Trump is a puppet who admires Putin and thinks he great. He wants to emulate Trump. Putin knows exactly what he's getting with Trump, and how easily he'll be manipulatable.  Oh, I think this is the end of what we know as the modern Republican party. Obama started the cracks and Hillary shattered them. We've got the Evangelical Republicans, the Tea Party Republicans, Trump Republicans, the straight up White Supremacists (I refuse to normalize what they actually are and call it "alt-right," personally). Plus the moderates that stepped away from the party this year. There's a very, very thin fragile layer of glue holding them together right now, but unless Trump delivers, I predict major infighting that happens fairly quickly. Not to mention buyer's remorse as they realize how much they voted against their own interests and things start going away that they enjoyed under Obama. As well as due to his tax plans, costs going up on pretty much everything.Gas prices going back through the roof due to the market instability is probably gong to be the thing that starts breaking them. We may see new parties form from where the Republican party stood. Or it could undergo a radical change in platform. I'm betting on a huge change in platform that alienates moderates hugely. Edit, had a final thought: We could end up with two "Republican" parties. /s is not a requirement or a rule of Reddit or the sub, just a strong suggestion. Especially if you're going to make a sarcastic joke that could be viewed as trolling so you don't accidentally get banned or your comment removed.I do wish there was a sarcasm button you could just hit for a different font on the internet, because it *is* hard sometimes.  After this election? I think there's a percentage chance that just about *anything* could happen.  Oh my god I just looked at the preview. Yaaaaas. This pleases me. We need more good sci-fi movies that aren't superhero or based on previous works nowadays. Note: I love the Marvel Movie megaverse to death (the superhero market is just getting a bit saturated), as well as am hugely fond of the new Star Trek (but yes, old Trek is still *better*, they're both good for different reasons.) I'm just a bit tired of the "we must remake EVERY old movie" or the "this is somewhat nostalgic of the 80s/90s, WE NEED A RELAUNCH OR MOVIE."  You don't think they prepped for both opponents? Plus, Kurt E. is more than a reliable source on this. There's also the fact that the overwhelming majority of journalists and political analysts came out after and said no, Bernie couldn't have won.  http://www.newsweek.com/missing-cuba-thaw-basic-human-rights-322234That's because a lot of his history is being rewritten with them left out, per the Newsweek article above. Amnesty International and the Human Rights Watch have extensive articles and entire sections devoted to Cuba, and have very firmly denounced Castro and his practices-both excellent sources. A good USA Today Opinion Piece series from when the Embargo was lifted that covers a lot of it. http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2010-09-27-editorial27_ST1_N.htmThat also points out a great resource, [the Cuba Archive](http://cubaarchive.org/wordpress/) which is dedicated to collecting and documenting the truth of the Cuban Revolution as well as Castro's full legacy. I know. Which is why WE must be her voice and keep pushing and calling and writing. <3 Which we've been doing incredible at. The worst thing we can do is lose all hope-EVEN in the event of a Trump Presidency. I know that I intend to be that annoying ray of sunshine in their side until the very end. :D  In other news- I keep seeing the preview for the Assassin's Creed movie because I'm watching the Simpsons 600 marathon. Has Hollywood not learned that video game movies DON'T WORK?  Because I refuse to give up hope, no matter how small the light shines. There is simply too much at stake for the people of America, and for the America as we know and love, and for so many people personally. Not only are people's rights riding on this, people's LIVES are.  I believe she will step up for the millions of us who have so much to lose in the event she gets an opportunity. I believe she will step up for ALL of us.  Then your best bet may be earplugs and a good pair of headphones. Though be aware-you could move to even WORSE neighbors. I'm next to 2 adults and 6 kids under 10 in a 2BR 1000sq foot with a violation of their lease dog to boot. (They're currently getting evicted.) The noise is over 120+ decibels INSIDE my apartment from them from around 8am to midnight or later.EDIT: Landlord told us "they're kids" and "kids will be kids" when we initially called when they moved in. We finally settled on ignoring them and earplugs etc. Someone else finally must have complained. You could start a log of times the dog is barking, duration, etc. Collect for a few weeks, submit to Animal Control for neglect and nuisance barking. Legwork on your part, but it may work. Your post is a violation of R8: Misleading Content and Bad Title. Usually we put the reason in the link flair when we remove. Also, the video was unrelated to the question being asked, and it was an off topic video for the sub. Hi MuDelta- This post is a violation of R4: No Meta Posts. Your previous post was a violation of R8: Misleading Content and Bad Title. Usually we put the reason in the link flair when we remove. Also, the video was unrelated to the question being asked, and it was an off topic video for the sub. No, this is not just directed at you, but also the appropriate people of this comment chain, and is a warning for breaking R9: Civility for not discussing this civilly.  Breaking down my posts:1. I acknowledge familiarity/awareness of Fidel's history2. I admitted he did do some good things (which was acknowledging your article and nowhere saying you lied?)3. Pointed out the fact he also committed horrible human rights atrocities that are too often being left out of modern day accounts of him and that's a trend, here's an article-that in my personal opinion, it's disturbing that he's being spun as a positive figure because of this. 4. Read your article, didn't agree with your views, but still acknowledged the contents and thought about it. The article was not enough, given my knowledge overall on the subject, to get me to change my mind on my own personal opinion of Fidel Castro and that he may have done a few good things, but he was not a good man and the human rights violations outweigh any of the good things he did. I try to be VERY, very careful when discussing matters of personal opinion in this sub because of my role as moderator. Just because I disagree with you and don't change my position, doesn't mean I don't still respect you.  Or Sharknado to happen? No one is saying that. Everyone take a deep breath and step back. Everyone is entitled to their opinion here, and to civil conversation about it. This is a warning to everyone participating in this chain. I believe his point was historic context.  Just because I have a different conclusion based on all the available information doesn't mean I didn't read the article-I like to read all sides of things. I also have the right to read it and not change my personal opinion. I'm not sure why you're getting so upset because we disagree on a subject. Yes. That's the one catch to it. It's a toss up, honestly, as to what path is best. Yes, if there's leftover money, it's going to the Greens, but they've actually got a recount going. It's a mine enemy is my ally situation, but we don't have a great history of trust from the Greens to build upon. We (the dems) are honestly late to the game on filing/pushing for the paperwork, now that she's gotten ahead of us, and I'm not sure if multiple pleas will be filed. Then there's the Electoral College and the legal news about how Trump may either have to sell his business (or you know, legal transfers, etc, I'm sure he'll slimy loophole it) in order for them to be able to vote for him. That's very true.On a funny note, I was just thinking to myself it would never be long enough for me to hear the word optics again after this election. lol. It was definitely on the buzzword bingo list. I think that's a huge side of it his articles, I know, really turned me off of him due to the content and some of the views he displayed there. I'm very much aware of his history-while he did do a few good things over his lifetime, he committed horrific human rights violations and a lot of other things that more that outweigh that. I'm somewhat disturbed at the fact that his history is being rewritten without those parts and he's being spun as a positive figure after all that he's done, and it's not just me. [Good piece in Newsweek about the phenomenon.](http://www.newsweek.com/fidel-castro-cuba-crimes-gerardo-herdez-431101) Yep. They have the blood of so many thousands looming on their hands. Also, somehow Dick Cheney is still alive. I'm still half-convinced he's part cyborg. Also, the Supreme Court isn't over yet. Obama still has a route to appoint his pick. I have a friend who is a superfan, and it was fun watching her excitement as she stayed up all night to watch all of them, even though I'm not a personal fan of the show. It's just nice to see people that happy. Silver, honestly, I feel really *didn't* do a good job this election at all.  I don't think many will mourn his passing, that's for sure. That's a chapter in history closed, for sure. I don't think this year has been so much an uptick in death rates, as quite a few of these greats and notables are finally reaching the age where risk of death goes up. You're welcome. I really do appreciate all the hard work you guys do to make our modding easier. It makes a HUGE difference.  This is doxxing and this will NOT BE TOLERATED. Anyone found to be posting this list will be permanently banned and reported to the admins **immediately.**  Sanders and Warren would have also had fuel to add to the hate machine on the other side. Sanders had a huge file from the RNC (not to mention atheist of Jewish heritage democratic socialist), Warren would have been the issue of a two woman ticket (I don't see how on earth we would have gained enough to counter the sexism and misoginy that was in motion). Brown *maybe* would have been a possible toss up better pick, but he still has a lot of the same issues as Kaine's pick.  Except the people who need it most and didn't vote for him are being punished too-some by losing their lives. The problem is, this punishes the people that didn't vote for him and have the same thing at stake and for people like me with severe health issues, our lives are on the line. And no, that's not a stretch of the truth.  Sec of Defense would be a good pick.  Tammy is a terrific person, and certainly a powerful figure, but at least right now she belongs in the Senate. She's not a terrific politician overall (though I knock on wood because 2020 is a way off) currently.  I *highly doubt that.* It may be the opinon of where you live, but not the collective opinion of america. He's got a 60+% approval rating despite the racism and won by huge margins. His concession was certainly a lot later than most would have liked to keep HIllary's momentum going. I do not recall him saying he ever wanted to be VP, but not sure if he voiced it either way. EDIT: I forgot the interview where he asked if she would be interested in being his VP and saying No to being hers. So it's a non-starter of a question anyways.I honestly don't think Sanders would have been a good pick because of the reported file the RNC had on him that was 2 feet thick with ammo. While it would have been a great ticket for the dems, it would have also flared the hate machine on the other side more, and prompted more turnout for them. All they'd have to do is scream socialism and Trump voters would be flooding the polls. (Yes, I realize democratic socialism is not the same thing, but you know how they will spin it.)  See, I'm not a fan of Booker, at all. I'm also not saying that the candidate has to be a woman either (I primarily voted for Hillary on her policies, and how awesome she is, not her gender), but it would be nice to see another woman at least be in the primaries to keep things normalizing. With the misogyny and sexism that was going on already and how huge a factor it was, not even the bit of momentum picked up by Warren's fans on the further left could have outnumbered the hate of a two women ticket. Please see above. I'm sorry that I can't brain tonight. Or they're retiring, thinking of downsizing and haven't moved yet? Not sure it's so sinister. Not legal, but a bit of life advice: if your parents don't agree with terminating his tecy and evicting him, you may not want to cause WWIII in the family by doing this. That's a good point. It's a lot of speculation three years out, but who knows? It is nice to see her looking less...I guess on edge is the word. I think right now everyone is looking to her as a source of hope and inspiration in the healing process. These pictures remind us that there is still good in the world.  Thank you for linking NP the first time! :D He can boast all he wants, but we'll see if the DOJ lets that stand. The thing is, I don't think she could win against the likely Repub picks (or a Trump rerun, but I don't see him running for a second term) for another term. She may have more recognition than Sanders, but she's still a relative unknown (for now, that may change over the next four years) and she has some pretty iffy positions for a general run. You're also right in that she needs to shape up and play the next three years smarter than this week, for sure. If she continues this path, no way in hell. Well, there's the lizard person theory as well as a few other theories in the conspiracy theory circles. While I will of course campaign for whoever won the Dem primary (though I don't always vote straight ticket, I vote on issues-I just don't see a liberal/moderate Republican who aligns with me on issues in the coming years), I REALLY don't see a Tulsi Gabbard run working out.  Ok-so there's a lot of *if's* here because the investigation isn't complete-but IF it did turn out to be the Russians throwing the elections, etc, I wouldn't put it past them. Not because buyer's remorse, but because that would put them in a HUGE position of power-they just would have rigged the election of the most powerful country in the world. It would be a HUGE victory in what could be a new Cold War era.  EDIT: Jesus, I really goofed here guys and I apologize. I'm extremely sick and I was also always trying to remain conscious of not revealing my exact location. She is currently Attorney General and was elected Senator, who represents CA of course. I accidentally said district instead of CA, and conflicted/confused myself in the rush between trolls and prepping dinner further. She's certainly an excellent prospect and would have a good bit of experience under her belt by then. I'm happy to be in her district. I'm cautiously trusting her about as far as I can throw her. I don't think anyone here is blindly trusting her either. But right now, it's a hopeful outlet and we simply want an audit and investigation into the vote. Oh, I completely agree. If anything else, to stop the normalization of the media when it comes to Trump and the things he's doing that we're already seeing. I'd never vote for her in a million years with her positions, but I certainly agree with her on this issue.  I've removed so many "republicans accepted defeat in 2008 and 2012" comments it's ridiculous. Their non-acceptance has been going on for EIGHT YEARS. I admit, there's a small part that is still questioning she's going to follow through and actually uses the money as intended due to past behavior. But I will take any ally we can get-it's going to take all of us.  Well, I'm just going to have to agree to disagree with you there. If he'd been white it would have been hailed as a great achievement and there wouldn't have been such roadblock. It's the same racism we're seeing bubble to the surface and be acceptable in public now.  It's not just on /r/politics, they've upticked here again after being very quiet yesterday. They're worried. All I have to say is GOOD. COME ON HILLARY! Good evening everyone! Hope you're all enjoying leftovers, and have escaped any crazy family members. Anyone try a new recipe for Thanksgiving that turned out awesome?  Oh, I completely disagree with his decision, don't get me wrong. I'm just pointing out that he's in a very complex and VERY precarious situation as President, especially with the balance of power transfer looming. I agree that it should have been taken with a massive block of salt as well due to the Russia/Comey situation as well as Trump's threat to national security and the situation as a whole. It absolutely should have been left to HRC. Absolutely. I can only hope that she follows her gut now, and it tells her to fight. Hi-moderator here. *waves* Welcome to the subreddit! Your account needs to either be 3 days old, OR have 10 comment karma in order to post here in order to cut down on trolling. I always suggest going to /r/news, or /r/relationships or another major subreddit, and make 10 comments. Then delete this post, and you can resubmit exactly as is so it ends up at the top of the queue. We're glad to have you here!-SandDollarBlues Bipartisanship. Simply filling positions straight party line looks VERY bad, as well as doesn't encourage cooperation across the aisle. Look at the amount of obstructionism he already faced. If all he tried to fill with was Dems, he wouldn't have gotten ANYTHING done. If there's one thing Pelosi is known for, it's not backing down and not giving in in a fight. I'm not sure it's a true weakness as much as a disadvantage in some portions of the political arena. Also, things looked a bit more clear cut election night-her lead in the popular vote hadn't truly taken off at the time she conceded. That said-he's also in an awkward situation as the president, because he's President to all the American people. If he had urged her to *not* concede, the R(s) would have exploded with accusations of election fraud and tampering by the president. Good afternoon everyone! I hope no one is *too* turkey comaed out. I am really glad Stein decided to step up and be an ally, finally. (It would have been nice if she'd done it before the election, of course). However, I don't think she deserves all the credit. That's due to the American people-the ones who campaigned for Hillary beforehand, and everyone who has come together after the vote with protests and action. Without them, none of this would have been possible. Without all of you, none of this would have been possible. <3 So thank you.  This is excellent advice. I do roaster chicken for the two of us due to ease+leftovers+ max amount of things you can get/make from the carcass.  Its frankly the "my vote doesn't matter" idea. That's it. People don't care enough to actually get up and give a shit and participate anymore and care about their fellow man. To quote a user from another thread: "Some people don't understand that every space is not their space and it's ok to just listen sometimes." :( That's so fucking uncool. <3 Just no explanation? WTF? The more Trump and them doth protest, the more they look guilty.  I am not a fan, but one of my friends is a Gilmore Girls superfan, and the explosions of stuff on her feed today about it have been fun. She's an infectiously excitable person. I am very excited for you and all the fans however! It's not often that a show gets an opportunity to have such a successful return. :)  You see some of the conspiracy that has landed in my inbox.  Hello again everyone! I hope your givings are being thanked and you have eaten your pie. :D  Then you're safe. :D  That sounds wonderful!  YUM. I wish I could steal a bowl! Do you at least like cake? The only question now is: National Dog Show or The Simpsons Marathon? For those who already saw it-did you have a favorite in the dog show? Completely understandable. I'm going through threads also and removing what I can, I (and my fellow mods) just can't be everywhere at once hence the reports are our most powerful tool before we can remedy the issue. At least it's not your country generating it? We much prefer you report rather than argue, because it is more efficient of a process for us to remove and/or ban them if you do. Whereas if an argument goes on, and it gets reported, we then have to deal with the multiple reports and that entire comment thread, etc.  YUM. I love Popovers! So finicky to keep from collapsing if you don't have a good recipe/technique though.  Actually, Thanksgiving lasagna sounds fantastic. I'm not really feeling turkey this year. Thankfully for our Thanksgiving on Saturday, we only got enough to have maybe 1 extra dinner. Actually, it's not so much the thanksgiving turkey and food for me as it is the leftovers for days. The turkey leftovers for weeks (and then pulling them out of the deep freeze months later) of my childhood has left the meat itself somewhat unattractive.  Oh my goodness. Now THAT is a recipe I'll be trying. It's *really* hard to go wrong with ribs, and slow-cooker puts the "easy button" on it.  Oooo! That sounds tasty. :D  Hello everyone! HAPPY THANKSGIVING to all of you from us here at the sub. I hope you are having a wonderful day filled with good people and free of the bad no matter if they are family or friend. What is the Thanksgiving Day food you're looking forward to most today? EDIT: Atrocious grammar, apparently couldn't brain well the first time. I'm glad you have a way out, but that feeling and insecurity absolutely sucks.  You too, eh? :(  How long do you have to ride for? No, it's not North Korea, but it's also not a democracy. We have rules, you follow them? We're all good! If you don't, well, we may have a few issues. However, you *deliberately* come here to break the rules, and we will come down hard.  All of the people who actually SAW the RNC's file on him said there was no chance in hell he would have won. He may have tied up the white (primarily male) vote, but at what cost? A large swath of women, minorities, the disabled, the upper class, the Christian vote, etc. Please report, report, report. I (We) will gladly take care of them. :D CALL, CALL, CALL! ***EVERYONE OF THE SUB, CALL!*** Good Evening Everyone! I hope your day is going well. As stated in the other Roundtable,I am SO GLAD a movement for an audit of the vote is FINALLY taking off!! I felt like they never wanted to get it off the ground.  The pieces on white grievance/privilege and white supremacism have also been excellent and very eye opening, if troll inducing. But we must confront it, even if it attracts trolls.  One of my friends is FTM transgender. He is so terrified of what is coming, that he is doing all the formal paperwork and legal document, ID, and birth certificate changes NOW and paying to expedite the process wherever possible. He wants to basically erase any paper proof that he was ever female. Thank you! :) Sometimes my brain manages to get something out that is good. EXACTLY. This sub is a slice of Hillary's America, and we're going to stand by her and her allies in the coming years ahead in our inclusive community.  This one makes me despair. To think it is ok to mock someone with a disability...but I know that those people exist. They seem to be the majority. Either they mock or don't believe that our disabilities exist. I've been on the receiving end of so much of it.  YAY! I hope you feel 100% soon. Make sure you complete your course of antibiotics if you have them. No creating more drug-resistant bacteria! :DI've got sinus infection/bronchitis combo right now and it sucks. Still not sure if the antibiotic is working or not.  It's a little eerie how closely I hit the nail on the head with what is currently happening.  There was a request downthread for the post I wrote during the primaries about [The High Cost of A Protest Vote](https://www.reddit.com/r/hillaryclinton/comments/4s40dm/the_high_cost_of_a_protest_vote/). It was written right at the end of the primaries as people were beginning to fall back and endorse Clinton over Bernie. I'm not going to pretend it's a literary triumph or anything, but people may enjoy reading it and it was requested. I think it's very telling that they don't have anything better to do than harass people they don't know over the internet. Can you imagine what they could do with that wasted energy if they actually put it to work in the real world?  I found it! [It was written during the last of the primaries when people started to come together to support Hillary.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hillaryclinton/comments/4s40dm/the_high_cost_of_a_protest_vote/)I'll post upthread so people can see it too.  I can't forgive those 80 million Americans. But I am going to hold on to the ones who deny and despise him, Trump, and the racism they stand for with all my might. We need every last one of them. I guess I'll have to disagree with you on that one-Hillary comes off as incredibly warm and charismatic to me. She seems like the person who considers herself everyone's mom or favorite doting aunt.  Somewhere in my history (I'd have to do some digging) was a piece I wrote for the sub about the high cost of protest voting. Would anyone like to read (it was during the primaries), if I dig it out and post in here? Exactly. That's a great TL;DR of my wall of text, as well!  This is a good find. Thank you for posting it. :)  I think she's planning. Hillary has never been one to take things lying down and NOT fight. Exactly. I've seen a lot of trolls and some people infighting that Hillary somehow didn't convey her message enough to the "working class" and that's why she failed. I hope you guys don't mind copypasta of my response to this from a friend's post on his FB page. (He's a Hillary supporter, never fear!) *LOL at the idea that Hillary "did not communicate that American's concerns were heard and were appreciated." Look at her entire fucking platform. It was ALL aimed at benefitting everyone BUT the rich guys. Most of the people railing against her never even read her plans because they were busy not thinking and listening to sound bites and blatant lies about her history or positions instead of her ACTUAL positions. Furthermore, the DNC has ALWAYS been for the working class, and Democrats have an enormous history of supporting the working class.**Which, honestly, the word working class is somewhat a misnomer and doesn't provide any helpful description. If you take it as it is it's anyone who works at all. No difference between "blue collar" or "white collar" (which many jobs are a mix of these days due to increasing technology innovations).**If you break it into blue collar and white collar workers, you're going to find that you can find equivalent salaries and benefits in both now because of how little of a value bachelor's degree has (yay reality of student debt) unless you're in some specific fields like STEM.**Not to mention, all of the hoopla of Donald Trump "bringing back the manufacturing and factories from other countries and bringing back jobs" is nothing but a nice idea that is impossible. For one a majority of those jobs are gone because mechanical replaced physical labor. Robots and other machines can do things with precision, strength, and speed far beyond a human. Also, it's cheaper. It's simply just cheaper in these other countries due to lack of environmental regulations, lower wages (often inhumanly low), and allows them to run around tax laws. Until we close the tax loopholes, they won't consider staying but that's the jobs that currently exist. The ones that have been lost are NEVER coming back.**Returning to the misnomer that is "working class." It would be much more accurate to not divide them into blue and white, but rather economic situation. Instead of working class, we'd now have "working without govt. assistance," and "working with govt. assistance (now called the working poor in most cases)"**So the hierarchy would go: 1%, upper class, middle class, working w/o assistance, working with assistance.**However, this ignores the most unprivileged classes of all. Yes, going from bottom to top, ALL of these groups have some degree of privilege because they *can* work. People who can work but choose not to have privilege both for being able to work and being able to choose not to, just for the record, even if it's to be a stay at home parent.**The next to last, where the line of privilege begins to end, is those relying solely on assistance to survive-overwhelmingly the disabled who cannot function on an everyday basic level, the elderly, and kids who often have life-altering disabilities, or there is not enough food or adequate medical care.) The overwhelming majority have very little to no possibility of improving their situation.**The last, with no ficial privilege at all- the homeless, those who honestly can't work due to disability but get denied due to the difficulties in the process, the unemployed who have run out of options. Under-18's in abusive situations in no way out (or older people who cannot get out due to being incapable). I'm sure I'm missing several situations or groups here, but the lowest of the low, the people who have NO way to improve their situation.**Hillary's America would have been a huge uplift for pretty much all but the 1% of America. All of this information was available on her website and in her speeches.**Specifically, among my friend's group, I watched people who I thought were intelligent until now pass on and preach the false allegations and accusations. I watched them claim the primary was rigged and stolen from Bernie somehow. I watched them trash her up until the week before the election and then the majority be "oh shit" and switch to praising her. Of the remaining about 30% said they were going to write in vote Bernie and 1 voted for Stein. Because "their votes didn't matter."****Hillary Clinton did not fail. She didn't fail to communicate. She was not a deeply flawed candidate.*** *Eevery "scandal" has been debunked. The American people failed to listen because they were too busy listening to, dulling their brains, and being shocked by the antics of Donald Trump. He used the same tactics he would on his reality show to keep people watching, with no content. And a minority (popular vote count, remember) bought into it because they never stopped to THINK and engage their brains.**It's a step away from Idiocracy.* I'm not going to tell anyone not to do it, I just think that that energy is better channeled elsewhere, where people were actually making an active difference instead of a more passive, easy, display. That is true. We all have our friend's groups and social circles, and I'm trying to respect the minority and other disenfranchised group's personal view. I don't want to speak for them, either. Does anyone else feel that the safety pin movement is largely nothing more than slacktivism? The majority of my minority friends are appalled and angry at it-"you'll stand up for us NOW? or rather, "You still think you speak for us." Reading a friend's FB post with 100+ comments going back and forth between a minority man and all of the white people who pretty much were all trying to play the part of...well, white saviors.  <3 I'm in the boat of the exchanges go, I go. Or if a number of patient protections go, I go. I'm so sorry that your mother has to live with such fear. It's been absolutely terrifying and just numbing knowing that you could be counting your time in months. With the ending ones being excruciatingly painful. Oh trust me, I am going to. I am going to fight with everyone, until my body completely gives out. As long as I can still breathe, I'm not shutting up.  The training session was at 9am Pacific. :P  I've had to remove two cousins from my friends list, as they bragged about being Trump voters and how he was going to "make America Great for them." Well, until your cousin dies because of your choice to vote for Trump and he abolishes the ACA. Good Afternoon Roundtable Crew! How are you today? I'm already exhausted and it's not even noon-Rain and I had an hour-long training session (we've been working on advancing her base training in a few areas) and it just destroyed me for some reason. I am really glad to see the movement towards an audit of the election moving forward and gaining steam. I honestly think, with the slim margins that happened, that by going through ballots again, crossing t's and dotting i's- we would find "errors" tipping the scales in Trump's favor.  Not to mention, how many of them have been being so harsh on Obama the past 8 years for being too SOFT on Russia? But protest voting! /s Right now, tensions are high. We also have had issues with people pretending to be Hillary supporters and concern trolling. We will keep going! There's certainly enough right now, and for the next four years, to keep fighting against and fighting for.  I was SO happy to be able to help elect her in. She's a wonderful woman and was a terrific choice. MUCH better than Loretta Sanchez. It's invite only-I'm in there, but I am considering removing myself because it is SO active. It's taken over my feed. Good evening everyone!!!!! I hope your day is going wonderfully. I just want to bring your attention to the fine print at the top of the Automod post: #The sub is not closing.We're not going anywhere, folks! This subreddit has become such a thriving community, and we intend to keep it going-a little slice of Hillary's America. :D Mine is still full of outrage at Trump's election and his cabinet choices. The overwhelming majority spent the entire election trashing her (mostly because Bernie didn't get the nomination), and/or they protest voted by writing in Bernie, or voted Stein or Johnson.  Well, you never know...there may be an investigation, the Electoral College vote, and an audit or recount coming that could still make that valid.  Since it's tiny, I wanted to enlarge it and point it out from the Automod message: ***The sub is not closing.*** I for one am glad to see that some of the top Dems are FINALLY calling for an investigation into the results and the election.  Good morning everyone! I hope your day is going well! In case any of you missed the second part of my issues with my neighbors trying to get the landlord to make me get rid of my service dog yesterday-All is well! My fiance finally was able to speak to the landlord and was told that the issue is not us, at all. Rather they have a problem tet (or multiple) that are causing issues. We're pretty sure it's the next door neighbors who were telling all the lies to the landlord about us. He was told they would be leaving quite shortly, either by choice or by force. I am so, so grateful for the time and the effort we've put into being excellent tets, and all the training I've put into Rain to being as unnoticeable as possible because it paid off in this situation. Well, I am certainly hoping that is true and they take Pence down with him.  Like I said yesterday-He's literally turning himself into Hitler 2.0. You think those would really STAY internment camps with adequate food, shelter, and safe conditions? Especially since Trump is an advocate for Torture? Well, we're not party to behind the scenes actions/content so we don't know if he is or isn't. Anything about that would almost certainly be private.  I'm still wearing my pins on my purse with pride. I refuse to give in, at least until (and IF) he reaches his Inauguration Day.  Hey-Obama is still President for 100 days. I know HE cares.  I've actually seen an INCREASE in our area. Silent protesting? GOOD NEWS! I have FINALLY caught a break for once. Talked with the landlord, and they said that we were fine, the issue is totally NOT with us at all. Rather, they've had problems with tet(s) for a while and that THEY will be evicted in short order, be it willingly or by force. I cannot tell you how much easier I am breathing right now. The only thing I have to be concerned about is them coming and knocking on our door or coming at us outside and screaming at us now, but that can be remedied by the cops if it happens. Plus anything else they do now will just dig their grave deeper with the landlords. So praise FSM.  I'm only pointing out what I *think* he's trying to do not if it's good or bad. Personally, I think that ANYTHING Trump and his cronies try and pass is going to have something attached to it, even if it is something that could potentially help people, that is deplorable and hurts the American public and basically negates the point of passing it. Ah- I never read any of the emails so as to not give any of the websites traffic or legitimacy/attention and drive up site views and money, so I was unsure of the details. Mmmmmm. I love risotto. I'm sure yours was tasty! Honestly, I'm not as worried about this. I think that honestly right now our intelligence people are probably working overtime to prevent that scenario, and will be for all of Trump's presidency. Remember, so many of the departments came out about him being a threat to National Security due to the nuclear comments and readiness to commit war crimes. To be fair- I *think* his latest movement is trying to make the best out of the horrible situation that is a Trump presidency. He appears to be taking anything Trump is remotely left on that could benefit the American people and saying he's going to push and try and work with them on it. But it remains to be seen just what those policies will truly be, and if Trump was telling the truth on it and they were all lies. His line was that *if* Trump was telling the truth he'd have an ally on these issues. So he's clearly not for a full blockade like some of the Dems have been talking about, but as an Independent, for trying to pass some legislation that *might* have at least minimum positive impact on the american people.  I don't think that's an appropriate blanket statement. It's true that many Americans failed her but I don't think the people of this subreddit did. I watched all of you doing everything you can to help her win. That counts for something.  Out of curiosity more than anything: Did anyone make the Podesto risotto, and was it any good? To start a war, the Top Brass would have to obey and give commands to the troops. However, they're VERY not keen on Trump. I honestly could see them standing up and saying no.  Yeah, I know we will breathe a sigh of relief then. Of course, this depends on our ability to still buy insurance, and if the ACA goes poof and the exchanges disappear. But I'm going to keep planning and hoping for the best possible situation. I'm so sorry to hear that. Our budgets have gotten incredibly tight as well, and we're figuring out what else to cut when we really can't cut much more without starting to go without basic necessities to pay for my health insurance until I meet the deductible and out of pocket max.Thankfully, next October will get us ficially stable because my fiance will get a major raise. We just have to keep swimming until then.  Thankfully my fiance is good friends with a housing lawyer and actually has political connections with several city officials and the city council. As above-there's no way they can LEGALLY do this, and actually they'd be crossing into harassment, intimidation, and discrimination territory. It would be one hell of a losing lawsuit with them, not to mention dealing with the city, state, and federal governments for breaking various laws concerning service dogs.  Legally, they can't. It's a service dog, who meets all the legal requirements, and we MORE than dotted our I's and crossed our T's when we got permission to have her and signed the agreement. We've/she's broken no tenement of the lease or the service dog agreement. If they try to do it, the HUD, the Department of Justice, the City Housing Manager, a lawyer (my fiance happens to know a housing lawyer personally who will go to bat for us), and several other people and city departments will be coming after them for violations of the Fair Housing Act, State Laws on Service Dogs, and the ADA. I'd also never give her up (in theory if it was legal), I'd move.They'd be stepping into a legal nightmare. What I'm mainly worried about is our neighbors trying to retaliate physically in some way if they see me or me and her outside.   I know, right? I seriously feel like I just want to collapse and curl into a ball and ignore everything, between this, my health continuing to collapse, the election itself, and the consequences of what will happen to me if the Republicans succeed in abolishing the ACA. Plus so many other small things. This site and our wonderful users are one of the few things keeping me sane.  Oh no! November, election aside, seems to be turning out to be a VERY sucky month for so many of our users. :( That is likely what we will end up doing. We just want to see if the landlord is even talking their talk as credible or we're fine in their eyes first.  Good morning everyone! I hope your day is going well! My yesterday afternoon and evening turned into a bit of a clusterfuck though we are on top of it and we have it handled, it's still stressful. Quite a few of our neighbors broke the "no pets" policy and got dogs in the last 8 months or so. Well, the landlord either finally figured it out or someone reported the people who do have them. Well, they all got phone calls yesterday saying they had to either be out or get rid of their dogs. (Most of us leave the windows open during the day during a cool day like yesterday, and the two of them on opposite sides were yelling and screaming.) Well, unfortunately, I also heard them asking about my service dog and after they found out it was a service dog, one of the neighbors began lying through their teeth in retaliation, trying to get her or us removed. Including saying I wasn't disabled (which is laughable since she always is with me in her mobility harness). She demanded that "she (the dog) be gone tomorrow or else." Well, that's illegal since there're no grounds to remove her, but still, stressful and freaked me out. We did not get a call or notice from the landlord yesterday, so that was good. Still waiting for them to call us back today after our message yesterday, so we can say our piece. I'm just frustrated that the people who broke their leases won't take personal responsibility for doing so. Or are blaming ME, for it somehow being unclear she's a service dog (who's ALWAYS had a vest or harness on when we've left the apartment).  :/  I want to give you a hug, as a woman. I have not seen this attitude very much after the election, even from my very liberal friends. Most of my female friends are terrified, especially about the loss of abortion access and even birth control being in danger, because of the consequences. So many don't want kids, or take it for health reasons rather than contraception (or both). There's also the issue they want to roll back the date and you will no longer be able to detect chromosomal abnormalities or other birth defects because it was too early. So many infants could be born only to suffer and die excruciating short, painful existences due to some of the abnormalities, others suffer varying degrees of bad quality of life. (Yes, with some exceptions.) That choice would be taken away from the parents to save the potential baby from the consequences that will last a lifetime. If they end abortions in the case of life of the mother (which some politicians push for), because there's a *chance* she and the infant could survive, however low, women will be reduced to nothing but incubators. If they succeed in a repeal of Roe vs Wade, rape victims will be forced to carry their rapist's babies to term and be reminded every day of that traumatic event. Anyone who cannot afford, or does not want children for whatever reason, including passing on genetic defects and diseases, (or any pregcy) will no longer be able to exercise their right to choose and be forced to endure 9 months of their body undergoing permanent changes that carry the risk of anything from minor complications to death. Not to mention, the President just made sexual assault ok. It's just "locker room talk" and behavior. <3 This is what we need. My DSi isn't compatible with any of the new games so I'm stuck replaying my old ones. At least it still works. I also get to play Pokemon Go occasionally in the car and at the dog park. Some of them won't even get it then. You'd think people that had members of their own family would greatly suffer under Trump would also get it-but they vote against their own family and their own interests. If you have the willingness and the determination, do it! WE BELIEVE IN YOU! I think we can manage both. Both are incredibly important.  Oh, I didn't think so at all! Just wanted to clarify what I meant. :)  This kind of thread is not ok and will be removed. If we are going to get through the next 4 years, we need all the allies we can get. We are not a hate subreddit. We never have been and never will be. I am appalled that this was left up so long and it will NOT happen again. Hillary's message, the key point, was and is Love and Kindness, and that we are Stronger Together against the threat that this country faces from Trump right now.  Oh, I think you misunderstood what I meant by that. It's just something THAT outrageous and severe just needs confirmation that it isn't a media clickbait. Sometimes a quote gets spun a little out of proportion. Given the absolute narrow margin by which he won, ANY sort of election tampering deserves a second look at the results.  Well, I guess it is true then. Jesus Christ, he really is Hitler 2.0.  http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/list-who-will-cast-a-formal-vote-for-president-2016-231235Politico posted a near-complete list. I've been working from there by eliminating the states who don't allow faithless electors:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faithless_electorAfter that it's a matter of Google. From the article: *Most of the names listed will lead to the official websites of foundations, local government offices, partisan organizations, etc. The majority of these electors provide emails, phone numbers, or mailing addresses for members of the public to get in contact.*If I can't find it, I skip it. Unfortunately, I can't post it to Reddit because of site policy, but I at least was able to give you my method.  I would take it with a grain of salt until you see it confirmed by multiple sources, especially a US one. I am hoping so, but unsure. Since the news/investigation conclusion just came out today, it remains to be seen what the FEC does with the news. We can keep writing, calling, hoping, and believing.  Or Hillary supporters for voting for her. I sure am! Very true. Also, remember how crucial screenshots of his Twitter, videos, and transcripts of his speeches have been in order to hold him accountable for things he has said and done. Save. Screenshot. Record. Be there when he tries to claim he didn't write something or say something, and he/his staff delete the tweet or video/interview.  Good morning everyone! How goes the day? The NSA chief confirming Russian manipulation of the Election. Not something I ever thought I'd see in my lifetime. A foreign government interfering so majorly with our elections. If that isn't grounds for a recount in all 50 states, I don't know what is. Just hoping that this *may* start to lend some more weight to both the recount and Electoral College movements.  Because they have nothing better to do with their lives. You should see my inbox from the past week. *huge hugs* Put on your oxygen mask first and then worry about assisting others during flight. AKA- Take things one day at a time and worry about yourself first before trying to worry about society. Depending on the care you need (obviously not applicable in all situations)often you can find low cost or sliding scale mental health treatment centers in your area. Don't lose hope.  Well...our generation will probably be ok. But future generations are probably going to be fucked with the environment thanks to President Trump. It's not even going to take the destruction of the Paris Agreement. You know that the EPA is going to be all but gone-coal will probably make a temporary comeback as well if emission standards are lowered.  The thing is if we don't try and outreach, and try, we're never going to change things. I'll probably draft something and see if I feel like sending it in a few days or so.  I will probably draft something, and come back to it in a few days to make sure that I have completely thought it through. Did they ever have a claim to begin with? It's always been built on smoke and shadows.  Hello again everyone! Dropping in (or at least being visible again) after a while of working in the background. I hope your night is going well! I'm trying to decide what to do about my cousin. He voted for Trump, and posted a very large diatribe on FB because "I am appalled with the way that many of the people that supported Hillary Clinton have reacted after the results of the USA presidential election." He then goes on to praise Trump and #Notallracistandsexist and #I'mawhitecisgenderguyandproud. I'm going to move him to my restricted list, obviously. But I can't decide if it's worth a restrained comment or not before I do so. I mean-I never see this cousin or talk to them, so there's not much danger in doing so.  The best thing to do is CALL. Call those offices! How about you don't need over 50%? Simple: Whoever has the most votes total wins. Period.  Um, that's not the case for mail ballots. They get counted too.  Hey /u/geobug- We don't want/allow traffic to be driven to these kinds of sites, which is what this link will do. Sorry I have to remove it. -SDB This is what is so, so dangerous and we must fight to make sure that it is NOT normalized and that we make sure that the truth is being told.  I try. I want to be here for you guys through this as much as I can, for as long as I can. I've grown to love the users of our subreddit and the sub as a whole, and I just want to see everyone be ok. Well, part of the reponsibility also unfortunately lies with the people to educate themselves. To me, this election also shows you the failings of the American education system as well as our society's attitude towards intelligence and knowledge. Part of the issue with the younger generation is History, Politics, Critical Thinking, Logic, is not being adequately taught or developed since standardized testing became the goal-teach to/for the test and not the student. We also as as a whole (with some exceptions of course) do not value or encourage intellectualism. In fact, especially in some parts of the country, it is discouraged. People are harassed and bullied at all ages because of it. It's a problem that spans all age ranges and categories, with especially hard effects on minorites. Until we solve that, and get people where they feel it is OK and encouraging to seek out knowledge, I'm not sure we'll make much headway with that voting block.  Yep. I think unfortunately that this may be one of the reasons. Trump voters (and third party voters) didn't want an experienced politician who knew the ins and outs of the political world. There's a very wrong, widely held, and persistent belief that running the country is like running a business. But it is in no way equivalent. However, I think Trump voters (and third party) were largely holders of this belief- and they see the fact he's a billionaire, supposedly (I think it's smoke and mirrors), and think he's a terrific businessman who will bring jobs and reduce the debt and deficit. However, none of them look beyond that and see what a terrible businessman he is, and how many failed business ventures and bankruptcies he's had.  *hugs*  We will take your opinion into consideration. In the future, please keep in mind this type of post is a violation of R4: Meta Posts. If you have a suggestion like this, the appropriate way to notify us would be a polite suggestion in the Roundtable, or a modmail. How do you know they didn't? I posted this in another thread, but it is valid here: <3 I offer you some of mine. The world may be dark and full of shadows, but I am going to be a ray of sun that fucking shines, no matter what happens, until the end, if there is one. I have enough for everyone.  I don't think it's being irate at people's criticisms, as much as trying to move on for the sake of the party, without a doubt ending the myth that he could have beat Trump. As well as nailing home there was no rigging of the primaries, and Hillary won fair and square, and ***was*** the best pick for the Democratic party As well as Sanders did not have the scot-free past that many of his followers thought, and would have been very vulnerable. It's time to close the narrative of Bernie vs Hillary and move on, and stop asking the "what ifs?" We need to look toward the future of the Democratic party, the '18 elections, and pushing for recounts and/or the Electoral College to vote for the will of the people.  You know-However bad Trump and Pence are, I do not miss Bush/Cheney one bit. Cheney was downright evil, and Bush started two wars and was responsible for the deaths of so many American, and civilian Afghanistani and Iraqi lives, and started two black hole wars we couldn't "win." Flat up LYING about the reasons to Congress and the American people to get us into the Iraq War in the first place, with the WMDs. Gave us the Patriot Act, and re-introduced torture into our intelligence gathering. Gave us things like Abu-Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay, and so many human rights violations. Drove us into the greatest economic collapse since the Great Depression. Nope. Do not miss them at all. The thing is-it's over a month away. So much could happen in a month to convince them that it would be an absolute disaster, or an end to the country we love and hold dear.  <3 You will never be alone here in the sub. The level of misogyny that is being displayed, and continuing to rise, is shaking me up. What I don't know, is this new attitudes? Or have all these people, been holding in this much hatred and misogyny all along, just waiting to explode? Men wonder why women think that every strange man could possibly be a potential preadator. This is why.  Why should Mexican-Americans or immigrants from Mexico be ashamed of their heritage? One of Trump's HUGE targets is Hispanics and immigrants, largely from Mexico. What you're describing sounds not like patriotism, but rather jingoism.  Please find a more reputable source, if there is any, for as serious of an accusation as this.  I always heavily campaign for local Senate and House seats, as well as in general. I am merely saying that until the inauguration, we cannot give up until we have exhausted every option then we can focus fully on 2018 races.  I'll see if I can read your mind: 1. Mobile modding!2. It's was just to the nearest intersection-about 75 feet. My 3. Just a TON of racket and I found out the street is dug up a few feet deep. (I didn't know that until I investigated the racket.)4. She needed a bathroom break too. 5. My maximum walking range is about 1 block most days with her assistance. How did I do? There are several things we can do before December 19th and Inauguration Day. We can also begin looking at 2018 at the same time. We're capable of doing multiple things at once and until we've exhausted every possibility, we must try.  I will not accept a President who does not respect a majority of the American people, or the office of which he holds.  It's up to us to not give into fear.  I know it's a long shot, but there was some talk during Gore vs Bush about the Electoral College voters voting for the will of the people. I just don't know if it will tip their hand, and they learned from that mistake.  Hi /u/kamee312, It appears you have been shadowbanned by the admins of Reddit. This has nothing to do with the moderators of /r/hillaryclinton or their actions. Please contact the Reddit Admins using the link below to find out the details of your shadowban. https://www.reddit.com/contact/ ***GOOD LUCK!!!!!*******\o/**** Banff is incredibly gorgeous. I had the fortune to go before my health got as bad and my mobility was impacted, and was able to hike somewhat. My sister and husband frequent it often.   There's still 34,000+ of us here. There's the 61,336,066 people that voted for Hillary Clinton, a majority of the people that voted. There's all the people protesting and coming together, and pushing for recounts in the close states, and for the Electoral College to heed the will of the people. There IS good in the world. There is hope. As long as there is even one person who believes and hopes, there is good.  Do you stay a long time? Last time I went to Canada they spent 45 minutes with my passport going over things. I have no idea why, and I was only 17? 18? at the time? I started to sweat after 20 minutes because my parents got theirs back almost immediately. But you know me. Suspicious character and all that.  Taking things one day at a time, and trying to focus on finding what good can I (and we as a sub) can do next. I feel like Thanksgiving week is just creeping up and I'm just like, "Where has the year gone!?!?" Now I'm going to have to start to think about Xmas presents for people! Attempting to take Rain (my service dog) down the street to see the construction clusterfuck while modding the subreddit at the same time.  <3 I offer you some of mine. The world may be dark and full of shadows, but I am going to be a ray of sun that fucking shines, no matter what happens, until the end, if there is one. I have enough for everyone.  Guys, as much as this is wrong-posting personal and confidential information breaks not only sub rules, but Reddit rules. What you do off the internet is your business, but we will not tolerate it here. It's doxxing.  Hello everyone. How goes your day?  Actually, yes. I would have. I've thought the electoral college was a travesty for years.  December 19th looks like it will be a historic day no matter what happens. Yeah, I don't think he's going to get that, even if he is president. Campaign debts? I'm not sure.  Part of me isn't giving up yet. Be it recounts or the Electoral College vote, as long as there is the slightest hope, I have to hope. I will also never stop trying to be the embodiment of Hillary's America, even though she may never have made it to the top office. Because I believe that we the people are the only hope this country has the next four years of surviving this.  This won't work for him. There's too much video and written proof that will be dragged out in the age of the internet. He will be shown to be a liar and a laughingstock.  A bottle of Ninja Squirrel Hot Sauce!  I just can't help but wonder if a recount push would be worth it.  I honestly love the campaign pin I have. It's the one with the heart background and the Hillary "H" logo on it. I think it would make a good tattoo. I have an 18 year old cousin (who lives in Mississippi, and never has been outside it, so I blame that for a lot of it) who proudly voted for Trump because of his statements and treatment of minorities and the LGBT community. She just has no idea what she's done. At all. To her own rights as a woman, even. The fact she can't comprehend that through her own blindness makes me sad. I've had to put her in my restricted circle on Facebook because she was getting angry at what I've been sharing post-election.  I think it's seemed very bad this year because so many of the greats are reaching the age that cancer becomes a huge risk and death becomes a possibility.  I think Obama and Biden have a pretty inseparable bond after these past 8 years.  I'm hoping that we learn from this. I think that third-parties are taking the wrong approach to trying to become a viable option. They're trying to build from the top down. They need to build from the bottom up. Local races, then State House and Senate, then Gubernatorial positions, then US Senate and House...THEN consider the Presidency. Look how long it took our modern day political parties to establish themselves. There's not a quick way to do it.  Yep. Not to mention, Racism is only part of it-everything Trump did, said, and stood for.  There was a meme going around Facebook, that said "Not all Trump Supporters are Racist, But All of Them Decided That Racism Was Not a Dealbreaker." Third-Party Voters decided that the destruction of the rights of minorities, LGBT, women, the disabled, people of certain religions, and other disenfranchised groups was not a dealbreaker. That Trump's vision of America wasn't a dealbreaker.  God, I do love the Biden & Barack memes. They've been a wonderful moment of brevity during all this. Does anyone have a favorite?  Putin may be smart, but he has a very hot and hair-trigger temper.  You know what's intensely frustrating to me? Looking at Facebook, and the number of my friends who are backing the safety pin movement that didn't do ***anything*** to try and get Hillary elected, and most (about 85% of them) spent the time leading up to the election complaining that she wasn't the *perfect* candidate, that she wasn't Bernie, or straight up trashing her.The rest voted third-party or didn't vote because "their vote didn't matter." Or "they couldn't bring themselves to vote for her, even if there was only realistically two candidates that would win." Or "I'm writing in Bernie." I just find it very ingenuine to have the attitude of "I deserve a pat on the back/praise for treating minorities/the disabled/women/Muslims/Etc like human beings *now* and standing up for them from now on."  I have no doubt that history will shine on her for making those huge cracks. I also think that she will go on to do something amazing after this, even though she hasn't announced it yet. She deserves time to cope for a while and wait for the results to be finalized.  Better than the first few days after the election. I know it's about as long of a shot as getting to go to Mars, but I'm still going to hope that something happens with the Electoral College on the 19th. That they learn from Bush vs Gore, and vote with their conscience and the will of the American people.  This is seriously worrying. Also, how long until one of them pisses the other off? They're both volatile people not known for getting along well with other strong personalities. I really think this "friendship" is going to explode into flames.  It's fine to post it here, but I just wanted to give a heads-up for anyone else who might be thinking of submitting it. FYI: That article is actually posted to the sub as the Kurt Eichenwald Tweet. Hahaha-Many of my friends are suffering from the same. I'm trying to focus on the positive that so many charities are getting a huge bump in volunteers and cash due to this, and that will enable them to provide more services. I'm making it. This result is a lot to come to terms with with how much is absolutely at stake. I'm just hoping for *something* to happen that tips the scales in my favor right now. My health is basically an absolute shitshow. In addition to some of the longer term issues I've had (climbing inflammation of unknown cause in the organ damage territory now, exceedingly low iron and other nutritional deficiencies), I'm sick on top of it so I'm a grumpy camper. Rain is being a good dog and keeping me company though.  This is one truly depressing area. All the progress we've made...and I'm now not sure there's any hope of stopping it once they gut the EPA, I'm sure. Can't have those government regulations!  That was amazing.  Hey! How are you holding up?  This movement has made me smile so much. Especially the people that are opting to send him a card acknowledging the donation. I can only imagine the piles of cards streaming in. It's glorious. 6 I feel was a factor that was underplayed this election cycle. With the 24 hour news cycle and the availability of the internet, it's pretty easy if you're isolated out in the country or even just in smaller towns in the majority of America to get the idea that everything is falling apart because the news cycle focuses on the absolute worst of it. The world becomes filled with terror attacks, murder, conflict, government having problems. Which I think was such a huge drive behind the people who voted for a "change" even though Hillary was more highly accepted and people felt she actually cared about them as a person when polled.  The ACLU? I have not seen that one (I tend to stay away from Cracked, but they *do* get one right in a while). I'll have to read it in a break from doing things.  It really is quite stunning how much is coming out about how ill-prepared he was. I mean, I expected him to be at some level. But I did not expect even HIM to be THIS bad.  Not to mention you get the satisfaction of tying up the phone system. :D This subreddit is not going anywhere, as far as I know.  *sprays with water bottle* Bad lll_lllama_naughty!  It's an interesting scenario. If he calls it quits before the 19th, I'm not sure if he and Pence would be considered a package deal in that case, or if Pence would become President-Elect and the Electoral College would then cast votes on Pence vs Hillary.  Good morning everyone! I hope that you are doing well. I'm just dropping in for a while to check on things and see how you're all doing, and work on a few things. <3 We care for our own deeply.  I'm sorry. That's the worst-you think you're going to make an awesome new start somewhere, and then you find that out. :( Goddammit, we need to find someone to bring you cookies. Or yell at your boyfriend for me. I'd like very much to yell at him for you.  :( Don't tell me-he's the reason you moved? There's around a million votes left to count, but unknown how many are for 49th. I voted for Applegate and he's 4 thousand or so behind. I want him to kick smug Issa's face out of office SO BADLY.  I want to give you the biggest hug right now. Consider yourself e-hugged. Is there anything we can do? Please stay safe. I am very concerned about our sub's "target groups" for the hate that has blossomed.  I didn't say no ties to political establishment, or no ties to the ficial sector. Just that the Obama Formula worked really well and there were a few reasons why. I also didn't speak in general but just about Booker-if Hillary was seen as close to the ficial sector, Booker would be absolutely HAMMERED there. I believe that's why he wasn't chosen as VP. I do get your frustration though. Honestly, I don't know who among the current Democratic party I'd pick for a run in 4 years. MAYBE, if they are willing to try again with a woman- Kloubachar. Actually, another good possibility- Kamela Harris.  No, but there is an argument to be made for balancing experience and bringing a relatively youthful look/fresh ideas to the office. I don't think they should have NO experience, for certain (like someone we know).  <3 I'm just happy YOU ALL are still here.  This is why an up and coming, younger generation person is so great. They haven't had time to accumulate years to nitpick.  There's nothing keeping him from posting it, as long as something else more urgent doesn't come along. (Which I don't think there will be.) Or if someone else decides they want to take a turn. In that case, I think we would still provide a link to it in the sticky, so people still know about it and could read it. We try and respect each other when we post.  Nope. Booker is going to be seen as WAY too tied to the ficial sector to be viable.  Reddit admins did not shut down S4P. Their own mods closed the sub and shut it down.  Honestly? I like the Obama formula. Someone up and coming, smart as hell, and had SOME experience in office. Look how successful he was despite Republican obstruction. Can you imagine how he would have been without that which I really don't think the next democratic president will? See, YOU get it. :D Honestly-I've always been fine with repealing it in favor of a true popular vote. A popular vote is truly the will of the people, by the people, for the people.  S4P made their own decision as a subreddit, we are not a part of that nor were we ever affiliated or involved in it in any way. Things got VERY toxic at the end for them, and from what I gathered that is why they chose to permanently close. ***THE MODS OF S4P CLOSED S4P*** This was news for weeks people.  This is what gets to me: The people on my friend's list and in my life who were SCREAMING about the Electoral College being unfair in 2008 & 2012, calling for it's abolishment, etc- now are the ones saying "you should just accept it, the Electoral College is just how it always is and it should never be changed." Thank you so, so much. I love and appreciate you all. I know I got frustrated initially Election Night-but this is a place I would never dream of leaving. I've made way too many friends and too much of a difference, that as long as it exists (well, and head mod is willing) I'm here.  It's just one dog-my service dog, Rain! :DShe has love in ALL the wrinkles, as I like to say.  I *hope* you are right, but many of them campaigned on privatizing Medicare.  I think there's real danger in speculating the "what if's" in other candidates, other VP picks, because there is literally no way to know how that would have panned out. It's entirely speculation based on the personal preference of said person, and it only serves to divide us when we need to come together. The facts are: Hillary Clinton won the primary fair and square. There was no evidence of actual tampering or fraud in how she won, despite how hard people tried to make there be. Bernie came through and backed us up, and told his people not to protest vote, even though so many ignored it and didn't heed his words.  I don't have words for that, but I do have hugs. Plus dog pictures in my post history, if you like that sort of thing. <3 And after it, SNAP, Medicaid, SSI, SSDI...They're going to destroy the social safety net. Thanks for that reminder, AutoMod. There's no monopoly on stickies-I think that if the rest of the mods have something to say you're welcome to say it (even if we may have personal disagreements about content, train of thought, etc). I don't see an issue leaving it up until this roundtable is over.  Happy cake day!  I'm going to go vomit now.  That is very true. I don't see how you can pretend *nothing* ever happened at this scale, but history shows you can. I do the fake call *ALL* the time, especially when walking the dog at night. Oh god. That's horrible. I'm glad that she is able to facetime you when she leaves, that's a great deterrent in itself. Even just pretending to be on a call can be. :( I hope she and you are both able to stay safe.  :( I'm so sorry. Be safe. We live in an overwhelmingly Hispanic, immigrant neighborhood. My fiance and I are one of the few white people here (we don't care who our neighbors are, as long as the rent price is good!). I just...every time I leave the apartment I am reminded how much privilege I do have, despite being disabled and a woman, just because I happened to be born with the color of skin I have. I also fear for my neighbors and our neighborhood in general. It's such a wonderful melting pot and I don't want to see that go away.  I agree. Pence is...I think Pence is another level because of how blatant he is about the women's rights issues for me.  Thanks fluffy. :) I needed a few days to come to terms with what I am facing (You can see my user history, I posted in the AM roundtable-I don't see a need to incessantly post it), but I'm back, and hell or high water I will be with this sub actively until I physically can't be. This is my refuge and there are too many good people here to not be.  You should see my inbox...ye gods.  Notice I said "hope" and not "expect." Unfortunately, that gives us Pence. Which is another level of horrifying. I think these next four years are going to be very, very dark for this country, *if* Trump is confirmed as President. A lot of people aren't going to survive it, quite frankly. But I *do* have faith our country will get back to Hillary's vision after this. Because I honestly think this is such rock bottom, people will realize just how good they *did* have it. At the end of those four years, they will be screaming for a change and liberalism. I have faith as long as the people who voted for Hillary exist- and the popular vote shows us that it's the MAJORITY, not the minority. We really are the silent majority, but we can't remain that way if we want to save our country. Do not go quietly into the dark night.  I may have to consider a subscription if so. I just can't believe that the media jumped on the Pro-Trump wagon so quickly.  Well, Melania *did* say her issue would be anti-bullying. I can only hope she actually rises to that challenge as a First Lady.  Unfortunately, I'm already seeing media turn ProTrump wherever possible.  The other thing that is troubling me is they are turning him into a fucking hero over things that he could not affect anyway, or saying he'd *consider* another way.Such as the two ACA things he LEGALLY can't touch, the under 26 and preexisting condition mandate. He mentioned not trying to repeal those (he can't) and the media ran giant headlines "TRUMP SAVES OBAMACARE" "OBAMACARE NOT BEING CUT BY TRUMP" "TRUMP AFTER MEETING OBAMA DECIDES THE ACA WILL LIVE." Then the actual article says he still wants to replace it with his tax credit plan or repeal it still. His position *hasn't changed.* He's trying to make himself look good by saying he'll keep the two things he can't touch... and clearly the media is buying it. Plus making him out to be some sort of saviour we should be *grateful* to for agreeing to keep those? It's infuriating and spreading false information.  Ah, ok. Honestly? A great number of them don't. However, ignorance is not an excuse, especially with the hate crimes and persecution already happening.  The ones that are truly horrifying to me are the large majority that *do*, and are still convinced they made the right choice. I stopped counting about 4 months into this election at the number of times that I should go die if I couldn't survive without the ACA. That I was "the weak genetic link." It would be "better for the country." That I "had no value as a human" (among other horrifying things that I'm not going to repeat) because I am severely disabled and can't work.  Well, don't forget women, the disabled, and LGBT in the "everything bad" column. But yes. That's pretty much correct. I suppose it's possible but highly unlikely that those would flip in a recount. Still-I will hope for any chance we have.  She wouldn't *let* you? You're an adult. You can do what you want. It doesn't matter what she sees you as. Shit like that makes me angry. (Not at you, at her.) It's controlling and manipulation wrapped up as "love."  I was very glad to be able to vote Kamela in. Frustrated as fuck that we are 4,000 votes away from giving Issa the boot, and I'm not sure out of the million votes left to count (unknown how many are for the 49th district) Applegate can squeak out the win. Though I give him MAJOR props for not conceding yet. You think, people would have learned with Bush vs Gore.  I'm going to try to be, no matter what happens. I won't go down without a fight. :) In the meantime, I figured we could all use some brevity. I know it's the longest of long shots, but I am hoping that maybe, just maybe, the Electoral College voters will both heed the will of the people (the popular vote) as well as stand up to the dangers we face as a country under a Trump presidency on Dec 19th. I'm not going to acknowledge it is over, until then. The other thing that could happen is that something could come out about his campaign that disqualifies him from the presidency still. But again, these are extreme long shots. [Obama also technically has the power to force-appoint Merrick Garland. I'm hoping he actually does it on his way out.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/obama-can-appoint-merrick-garland-to-the-supreme-court-if-the-senate-does-nothing/2016/04/08/4a696700-fcf1-11e5-886f-a037dba38301_story.html) The roundtables are not going anywhere, as far as I know. Nor are we as a subreddit.  Yep. I'm not sure it will even be a year before something huge comes out. But then we're left with Pence. I've been crying since Election Night. I had no feels left for it, I was so numb.  Good afternoon everyone. I hope your day is going well. I think I got my news out of the way in the AM, so I am going to post pictures of my service dog being cute instead. Because dog pics are what we need. [Infusion Day requires creativity in bathroom breaks](http://imgur.com/AXXPxTH) [Sleeping upside down is a underrated talent](http://imgur.com/an0CvWv)[Rain sees the beach for the first time. She quickly noped out of the water after this](http://imgur.com/wDZQKm5)[Her opinion on mornings](http://imgur.com/QvBDF08) :) I am known around here as being one of the most hopeful people. I am going to be hoping beyond hope that something happens, and it isn't the case. I've already started fighting to keep it, and I will fight until there is nothing left in me. However, after 8 years of trying to do just that, 60+ votes, and then Trump running on it being a major platform, as well as other legislation that would greatly affect those with conditions/disabilities (that don't even have to be as severe as mine)...I will trust it when I see it, and when it doesn't happen.  Good morning everyone. I hope your day is going well! I apologize that I needed to take a few days after the results were announced. This election, and the results, mean a lot of things to the country, as well as a lot of things on a personal level to me. I hope that you can understand when I explain what I am now facing. Unless Trump completely backs off on his idea to repeal or majorly change Obamacare (and no, NOT the two provisions he has mentioned- while that is a wonderful start for so many millions of the country, it's not going to cut where I am personally concerned), I am going to die. Unless there is some miracle of state legislation, something, I will die. This is not an exxaguration, this is not hyperbole. My fiance likely will too, and so many of my friends. So I hope you can understand my time away. I am going to fight as long as I can, and as hard as I can, to be here (both alive and present in the sub.) As well as fight as hard as I can to keep it from happening altogether. But my time is now numbered in months when he takes office-it just depends on how quick he decides to do it. I just want to say that I love you guys so much. Besides notifying people today and tomorrow, I'm not going to talk about it much unless someone asks how I'm doing out of respect for the subreddit. Because this needs to stay a happy, safe place for everyone.  Thank you. We're trying.  No, it wasn't. Yes. He's not banned, and never was. He's not banned. You're not banned. Because the overwhelming majority of the vote isn't in, and the states haven't been called? MSNBC is a LOT easier to watch.  I respond that yes, the remaining vote is more than enough to eat that lead. Obama won Broward by over 250k votes.  Yeah, I felt fucking sick reading that comment. France has *always* been constantly rocked by strikes. It's nothing especially new with Macron in charge. I miss Booker. I'm sailing on Carnivals oldest tomorrow and this sounds awesome to me. 🤪 The colloquialism is "Republicans fall in line, Democrats fall in love". I think it might be a quantum effect kind of thing where it is both simultaneously. It really is a great indicator of someone who has absolutely no idea how politics works. That kind of bargaining only works when there is a reason for the other side to actually engage with you in the first place instead of walking away. Now someone post the picture of Maria, Rose, and Sheena eating their mother raw. I'm waiting for my transfer to Robinhood to clear myself so I can pick some up at a discount. :) >wonder if class action lawsuits will result from this. They are being held essentially in a prison They might, but they'd almost certainly lose. Quarantines are entirely legal.>and starvedI very much doubt that. Uncomfortable and getting less food than they would prefer, sure. Starving, no. They've been hitting /r/democrats hard too. It's basically what happened in 2016. One of the big disappointments to me this cycle has been how deferential Warren is to Bernie. Biden has fully powered up to put an end to malarkey. Biden actually mentioned it earlier. Biden is DONE with Steyers malarkey. I wonder just who the fuck the people who say otherwise think *should* fill that role. Omfg I'm so sick of hearing about the Iraq War vote. Wow Warren really walked into this. /r/moretankiechapo throwing tendies Biden stanning NATO 🥰🥰🥰 Biden literally commanding a standing ovation is a brilliant move. Warren reminding me why she's only barely better than Bernie. It makes me sad when Amy and Pete fight on the debate stage. It's like watching your parents yell at each other. Because the flu kills hundreds of thousands of people a year but a lot of people still don't take it even a fraction as seriously as they're taking coronavirus, which has far less of an impact. Good point. Hot take: if they're going to take increasingly dramatic measures over coronavirus they should also ban people who don't get the flu shot without medical exemptions. Oh, I thought you must be speaking of someone else. I didn't expect you to be lying about Pete's policies by actually claiming he doesn't support the LGBT community. My mistake. >let's celebrate decades of activism by rallying around a candidate who doesn't support any policies that are important to LGTBQ... Yay? I agree that the erasure of Buttigieg's historic candidacy has been a particularly disgusting example of homophobia. Didn't world of Warcraft just have it's 15th anniversary? It makes me sad that the police haters have to show up in even such an unambiguously good thread. This is a very good girl who deserves all the scritches. This is especially baffling since Trump is notorious for hating pets, and dogs in particular. He considers pets low class. There's a difference between healthy adjustments after a health scare, and dropping large amounts of weight very rapidly at almost 80. Relevant tweet: https://twitter.com/SIR_traline/status/1225077030867406851?s=09 The brigaders in /r/democrats are freaking the fuck out over this article lol.

I suppose it generates high profits and thus the emphasis. Honestly I'd try it if they didn't charge such fucking ludicrous prices for it.

Sounds like a great way to make the crew despise you. I'm going to be on Fantasy this weekend and hopefully there still won't be many people around Serenity. Figure I want at least one day of reading a book in the sun with multiple boozy drinks. Not at all. Every major candidate supports healthcare access for those who can't afford to pay.https://joebiden.com/healthcare/>Expanding coverage to low-income Americans. Access to affordable health insurance shouldn’t depend on your state’s politics. But today, state politics is getting in the way of coverage for millions of low-income Americans. Governors and state legislatures in 14 states have refused to take up the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of Medicaid eligibility, denying access to Medicaid for an estimated 4.9 million adults. Biden’s plan will ensure these individuals get covered by offering premium-free access to the public option for those 4.9 million individuals who would be eligible for Medicaid but for their state’s inaction, and making sure their public option covers the full scope of Medicaid benefits. States that have already expanded Medicaid will have the choice of moving the expansion population to the premium-free public option as long as the states continue to pay their current share of the cost of covering those individuals. Additionally, Biden will ensure people making below 138% of the federal poverty level get covered. He’ll do this by automatically enrolling these individuals when they interact with certain institutions (such as public schools) or other programs for low-income populations (such as SNAP).Learn more about how Biden’s plan for health care benefits communities of color >>https://peteforamerica.com/policies/health-care/>Expand access to coverage through Medicare for All Who Want It. ​The Medicare for AllWho Want It public alternative will help America reach universal coverage by providing anaffordable insurance option to the currently uninsured. First, individuals with lower incomes instates that have refused to expand Medicaid will be automatically enrolled in the public option.Pete will also end Medicaid work requirements that take health care away from people. Second, individuals who forgo coverage through their employer because it’s too expensive will be able toenroll in the public option and receive access to income-based subsidies that help guaranteeaffordability. Third, middle-income individuals and families who were uninsured because theycould not afford coverage will be eligible for subsidized coverage through the marketplace foreither private insurance or the public option. The public alternative will provide the sameessential health benefits as those currently available on the marketplaces and ensure that everyonehas access to high-quality, comprehensive coverage.https://amyklobuchar.com/turning-ideas-into-action-senator-klobuchar-on-health-care-and-prescription-drugs/>Propose legislation to get us to universal health care. Senator Klobuchar will propose legislation that gets us to universal health care, which includes creating a public health care option by expanding either Medicare or Medicaid, as well as improving the Affordable Care Act to help bring down costs to consumers through reinsurance, providing cost-sharing reductions, expanding premium subsidies, and continuing delivery system reform. Her legislation will also provide additional consumer protections and lower the costs of prescription drugs through aggressive reforms including lifting the ban that prohibits Medicare from negotiating the best possible price. These programs significantly reduce cost to consumers and help promote choice.>To pay for these investments Senator Klobuchar will increase the income tax rates for the top two brackets to the rates that were in place before the 2017 Republican tax law, further raise the income tax rate for the highest tax bracket and implement prescription drug reforms. **** > I am a Democrat. I will vote democrat as long as I am welcome in the party. I don't think it's too much to ask that we don't demonize one another during the primaries. I'm a Democrat too, and I'll vote Democrat even if people on the internet are mean to me.>I've been doing this long enough to vote for Clinton, Bill not Hillary. I have been through 7 primaries and this is my eighth. I have never felt like this before. I have e never felt that my opinion was unwelcome. And perhaps it's not is the problem. Perhaps I'm not a democrat anymore. If leaving the party because I'm unwelcome is selfish, then I guess I'm selfish. Fair enough. You can support, and vote however you like, but you aren't going to be immune from criticism for your decision. Fuck knows I got enough crap for liking John Delaney, and those of us who support Hillary on Reddit are still routinely shat on for it, but we aren't bailing.>Votes aren't guaranteed and treating people poorly, then expecting their support is entitled. Perhaps that's what we'll call those people since you've already staked out selfish.Sure, I think that's an entirely reasonable level of entitlement. What concerns me the most is when they come from his top level surrogates and campaign staff and he shows no ability or inclination to control them. Really paints a disturbing picture of how dysfunctional and toxic a Sanders White House would be. They're pejoratively called the champagne socialists for a reason. > very upset with Biden, Beto, Booker, hell even Kamala, for not running stronger campaignsNot to mention !DELANEY who should have saved us from protectionism. :( > but he's the only candidate I've ever heard of who has any coherent strategy for changing the political landscape of the USYou should read more, jesus christ.>I see no reason to believe that anyone other than Bernie wouldn't just be Obama 2.0.Ah yes, a repeat of the President with a 95% approval rating in our party and who is generally considered one of our best Presidents would be so fucking terrible. Aren't they doing a recount though? I think Bernie will be a disaster for our country, but it's obviously far more important to et Trump out of office and start implementing at least some action to stop climate change and close the concentration camps on the borders, so I'll be there no matter what to support him in November if he's the nominee, but you'll refuse to if people aren't deferential enough to you in the primary? Do you really not see how selfish that is? > I meant to put supporters. You don't get to rewrite history. The entire point of the article is that Sanders' surrogates can and should be held accountable for the things they've said and done when it hurts the entire party they want to lead. Wanting change isn't an excuse to lie about other people and organizations. You can't push conspiracy theories about the DNC "rigging" primaries against Sanders and expect people not to acknowledge that they originated with you when Republicans start using them against the Party. It's not. If you'd the article, you'd have seen that it goes out of its way to establish that it isn't blaming Sanders himself. I miss Hillary. :( Yes, we all know Bernie has the most extreme proposal. That doesn't mean we all agree that it's the best. I still wouldn't support Sanders because of his demonstrable incompetence at managing a Presidential campaign, much less the entire executive branch, his abrasive attitude, and the fact that he'll probably be dead in a couple years anyways. It's refreshing to have someone representing Alabama in Congress who actually seems to take their job seriously. I'd nitpick this by saying Hillary was hardly a moderate. She has consistently been the most liberal members of our party. She only looks moderate when contrasted to Bernie, who is on the fringe left as an actual socialist. It's almost certainly an ActBlue form, where the option to donate monthly or once is on the previous page. You have to select it before you click the amount to donate. > At the same time, as a registered democrat that votes and supports the party, but also happens to like what Sanders is selling, I feel like I should leave. The democratic party is incredibly unwelcoming at the moment at all levels. It's not just hear on reddit and talking with other democratic voters where I feel like I'm immediately a terrible, awful democrat. Hearing about things like Kerry's comments about a last second run is terribly demotivating because it makes me feel like if the party is THAT opposed to Sanders, am I in the right place.If you're a Democrat because you believe liberal and progressive policies, surely you won't stop supporting those policies because just one politician isn't liked? The unfortunate reality is that relationships are important in governing throughout all of history. Bernie is facing a lot of blowback from the Party because he never really bothered cultivating those relationships, which Hillary Clinton noted to some controversy last week. That isn't in itself a good or a bad thing, it's just the way it is, and it certainly isn't your fault or something you should blame yourself for or take personally. We've had a half-dozen debates, in which all the candidates have repeated ad nauseum support for universal healthcare. How many more do we need? >But I live by an area in Michigan that flipped because of high voter turnout. I still think a combination of Trump hate and Bernie inspiration made people more engaged in the political process.There's no evidence for the latter, though. The blue wave of 2018 happened because a bunch of moderate blue dogs flipped republican seats, something they did by very deliberately *not* positioning themselves as associated with Sanders. Of course not. It's always going to be better to get Trump out of office and campaign for Congress to block Medicare For All later. >But a lot of why we won the house were people like AOC being inspired to run because of Bernie.Except that literally has nothing to do with it. AOC primaried a center left Democratic incumbent in a deep blue district. For reference: http://howmanyseatsdidthejusticedemsflip.com/>His platform is a political revolution that is why people are inspired to vote for him and engage in the political process.Except Iowa had lower turnout which indicates that that isn't the case. In any event, plenty of us find his "Revolution" a huge turn off. I really wish we'd move every state to closed primaries. Oh definitely, but they've gotten a lot louder about it. It's been fascinating watching the Bernie Bros and the far left metastasize the last few years into full on hating liberalism. This right here. ♥️ Hillary is actually one of the most liberal members of the Democratic party, so no. :) >Bernard is the real deal tho.🤮> Not interested in more corporate moneygrabbingI am though /r/conspiratard Oh no, we do get it. But the label means less and less when you just use it to smear anyone who threatens Bernie Sanders electorally.I also don't share the unhinged hatred for big businesses. If you want to pretend the Senator with a career history of being strongly for ficial regulation and is literally running on a platform of breaking up some of the world's most valuable companies is some kind of corporate stooge, no one else has to join you. It really should have died after 2016. It's unfortunate that it stuck around through all the changes. >She's just another corporate politicianAh yes, the corporate politician who wants to break up Google, Facebook, and Amazon, and wants to effectively nationalize health insurance.Do you guys really never think about how ridiculous you sound? I get that "corporate" is really just shorthand for "opposes Bernie" at this point, but can you not descend into completely Orwellian newspeak? I got this for my build last year. I don't do anything crazy with it, though I did set the fan profile a lot more aggressively than the default. One of my favorite gamer ironies is how the ones who whine about historical accuracy are always the ones who seem to have learned their WWII history from BuzzFeed listicles about famous snipers or something. >I need more shipping material.I'm actually not sure what you're asking.

Pete is actually Episcopalian. Straight into my fucking veins. My favorite story from caucus night was how apparently the Bernie supporters all started cheering and clapping in one precinct when Biden and Yang were declared not viable and they ended up getting not a *single* one of them on realignment. >The moves fit a pattern of anti-LGBTI rhetoric espoused by the ruling right-wing party Law and Justice (PiS), as well as Krakow's archbishop, who had last year described the LGBTI movement as a "rainbow plague".For Christians who hate us so much, they sure go out of their way to make us sound fucking epic. Oh yeah, it feels like a million years ago though now lol. Pretty crazy to think we've gone straight from the first woman winning Iowa in 2016 to the first LGBT person winning Iowa. Inspirational, too. Yeah, it's unfortunate. My hope is that at some point Biden, Baemy, and Pete are going to combine into some kind of neoliberal megazord to stand up for free trade, data-driven climate policy, and internationalism. > His position on trade has basically always been "Trade deal XYZ is unfair, and we need a trade deal that does {thing that exactly describes XYZ}." My favorite part of the Democratic debates was when Warren literally did that and Delaney turned to her and told her she was describing TPP. >Bernie hasn’t given an F about sound “right”. He says what he is convicted aboutThat's a pretty big reason why I don't support him. After four years of Trump, I want a liberal president who values diplomacy, tact, and compromise again. Same. Wonder how many people will think the title is bashing on Buttigieg rather than the huge compliment it is. >“We all felt very confused and frustrated when the results weren’t coming in,” said Evan Weber, national political director of the Sunrise Movement, who spoke at the caucus night event. “Young people already have an immense amount of distrust for the Democratic Party because we see the ways in which the establishment has consistently shut us and our issues out in favor of maintaining a broken status quo. Incidents like this don’t help repair trust in the party or the system as a whole, and make it harder to convince young voters that the process is worth participating in.”These people just sound straight up fucking nuts. > Who is his base?Center-left liberals and moderates who want someone younger than Biden. February 8, Carnival Fantasy, out of Mobile, AL! I'm a millennial cruising in a few days and I kinda feel you. This sub is alright but cruisecritics seems a taaaadddd geriatric.

Thanks! > Biden bombed and is proving to be unviable, or at least for the moment is anyways. Biden did worse than expected, but it's always been known that his path to the nomination runs through the South. I'd say the bigger story is how well Amy and Pete did, and how close it ended up being for Bernie to win. > Also, the hate for Bernie supporters is another good reason to acknowledge this party is not something I should believe in.If your support for the party is based on being personally popular rather than principles and political beliefs, sure. I'd encourage you to take some time for self-reflection to discover for yourself what you believe about the world, the society you live in, and what you want for a future in both of those. Nobody is putting a gun to your head and forcing you to vote for Bloomberg in exchange for money, so no, the nomination isn't being purchased. On that note, I'm generally sick of the seething hatred of anyone who succeeds in our economy the last several years. There are a lot of entrepreneurs out there who've gotten very wealthy and live well because they've worked very hard and taken significant risks. Old money like Trump, who was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, is not the norm. >That sounds like a terrible subMALARKEY DETECTED Yeah, that's part of why they're stupid. I love it. Blessed be Lord Soros. They're already brigading /r/neoliberal screeching about the DNC rigging Iowa for Biden. Sure, all for the glory of Lord Soros. Hail capitalism and all that. I can hear this in Biden's voice lol. Ok Bernie Bro. Honestly the silver lining for me if Pete wins is that the homophobic CIA conspiracy theories are especially entertaining, at least. They are trying to run the caucus with an app they apparently never stress tested lol and it's absolutely going to shit. New sidebar image? I'm the Amy supporter looking at the Bernie supporter in disgust during realignment who went Warren. Yes, and hopefully grandma and the other Boomer voters save us from Bernie. Ohhh. Well good then. It would be so delicious if Sanders lost again because his supporters were, *again*, too sucky at actually voting. Make this meme and post it to /r/Gamingcirclejerk for karma. They'll pretend the same thing after the general too. They'll just make up some bullshit about how Hillary stabbed Bernie in the back to stop le revolution. > CNN just reported that only 29% of first-time caucus goers went to Sanders. 22% for Pete. That bodes BADLY for Sanders.It's late at night. ELI5? What would happen to Pete's delegates when/if Pete drops out though? I'd happily let her do that if she'd be better on trade. They're the same thing, really. Sounds terrible. Why are you posting it here? In the disaster of American politics, one of the small joys is that at least the UK is fucking itself over just as hard. > i just want a place to discuss asian culture without seeing some G_d awful takes about asian women dating outside of the race being traitors/r/noveltranslations or /r/martialmemes? That obscure bit is the closest I get but I don't think I've ever seen an incel. Remember 2016 when /r/SandersForPresident would be full of morons who forgot to register or arrange transportation/time off work/whatever and would panic at this kind of comment? Imagine having President Hillary Clinton facing the novel coronavirus outbreak without having gutted the CDC's pandemic task force like a moron. > The conspiracy nuts have already started spamming how Bernie got cheated this year.> > > > They don't have evidence of anything, but they're sure trying like hell to start getting upset that group.Fucking how? The voting only *just started today.* I'd feel a lot more like chuckling at this if there wasn't a very real chance that an actual fucking Trotskyist wins the Democratic caucus. An admitted one. I'm fairly sure the free room and board counts as that though. > Except for Bernie:) I'd be thrilled with either of them if Uncle Joe doesn't pan out. ...Isn't that a fairly major FEC violation? It's not common at all, it's very much a phenomenon of the extremely woke social media left.Never forget in the words of our great 2016 candidate:>[America is great, because America is good.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99LaHOJBlHw) Well yeah, the difference is Trump doesn't overtly and explicitly identify himself with fascism the way Bernie has tied himself to socialism. Thinking people are brainwashed just because they don't like socialism, a failed political and economic system that many living saw ravage the world, is a prime example of what the article is discussing. I doubt he'd even try tbh There's nothing there, they just want to scare people off voting for him. Depends. A lot of people see socialism as just as bad if not worse than Trump. I'm guessing a lot of those people aren't actually from Kentucky lol. Bernie Sanders has the worst energy policy of any candidate running, so it's safe to say to that no, he knows nothing about it. I miss her so much. >I don't think you're engaging in good faith here. I'm not trying to rehabilitate socialism itself,I'm being facetious since you seem to be missing the point that blunting socialism as a pejorative isn't a worthwhile thing to do because it is, indeed, really bad.>There's a significant probability a "socialist" candidate ends up being the nominee. What then?Well, if the candidate is Bernie, we're fucked, since he *actually is* a socialist and a previous Trotskyist who praised the USSR and the Castro regime.  Seems to me the obvious solution is to not attempt to promote such a destructive and reviled ideology. Okay, well, good luck rehabilitating the failed political and economic system loathed by about 4/5ths of Americans which has never been successfully implemented. In the meantime the rest of us will avoid the issue altogether by backing a capitalist candidate for Democratic nominee. >The problem is that the Republicans will scream "socialism" regardless of the candidate. Joe Biden? Socialist! Pete Buttigieg? Socialist!Except for them it isn't true. For Bernie it is. That distinction actually does matter.>f we want to win we have to destroy the fear-mongering power of that word.But socialism actually *is* really bad, so no thanks. >Oh, that's not so bad. We've done that countless times. It the *privatizing* that's real bad! For profit this-- for profit that!Profit is definitely good.>No, we need lots of things under government control so that we can vote people in and out if we don't like what they're doing.You can do that now. Just invest in a company and you'll get a say in it's leadership proportional to how much you've invested. The difference here is socialists like yourself want to seize control of the entrepreneurial activity of others for your own benefit without giving anything in exchange, any interest in the growth of said business, or any rational reaction to the markets. It almost always goes shittily, as shown in history, which is why the Democratic Party is a liberal capitalist party.Also the vote manipulation is really obvious. If you're going to pop into a subreddit you've never participated in and suddenly comment scores start plummeting, well, everyone is going to know it's you. They aren't completely stupid. They do realize that after 4 years of incompetence Trump's best chance for reelection is to force Americans to choose between him and something they like even less: socialism.I expect that clip of Bernie shirtless and drunk in the USSR would be playing on repeat nonstop. Definitely going to do as much as I can to prevent that from ever happening. Bad like nationalizing multiple sectors of the economy bad, glad I could clear that up for you. >I think you change it through public ownership of significant parts of the economy.Holy shit that's astoundingly bad. > Bernie is going to be the nominee, even the establishment knows he's gonna win iowa, they're freaking out so muchBernie was always expected to win Iowa. Nobody is freaking out about it. The only surprising thing was that it took so fucking long for Bernie to pass Biden in the state polls there. > Bernie and Hillary tied in KentuckyI'm not talking about McGrath's primary, I'm talking about her general election.>No need to be so divisiveI agree. > So he's just sat on his hands the entire time he's been in the Senate? I mean... basically yeah. Yup, there's also rumors that they're going to spin Bernie as the "winner" of the caucus if he gets the most votes first round to discourage other candidates' voters from realigning or just getting discouraged and leaving.https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/02/berniesanders-campaigniowa-results-110318 > Your special graph is referring to extreme poverty onlyAs I said, it's too bad that you hate the global poor. >It's cherry picked and doesn't erase the fact that the working class is struggling today.The working class is doing far better than in the past, however, thanks to great neoliberal policies like NAFTA and improving conditions all over the world. That's adorable coming from a Chapo bro ignoring all the actual data on poverty, but I guess that is all the far left has. ;) Makes sense. Given how lackluster Trump's presidency has been, they know they'll need to shift it from being a referendum on his job performance to a referendum on something even less popular: in this case, socialism. I just finished Season 2 and what happened to Yanli fucking broke me. The only thing I would have changed would have been them making it more clear that her killer was that random kid who was aiming for Wei Wuxian, and actually showing him putting the Tiger Seal together. > And if you have Prime the Amazon card is 5% CB with no AF Also the Amazon card is free if you have Prime anyways, which comes with a huge amount of other benefits if you're into Amazon's ecosystem at all. > It's great for the richest people in the world, yes. For the rest of us, it's multiple jobs, getting into debt just to get a higher education to edge out the competition (which is other middle class and lower middle class people trying to survive). This is a lie. Why do you hate the global poor?>But yes, at least the economy is good!It's pretty great! Can't wait to get a pro-business Democratic President back in the White House to undo the bullshit Trump has done to muck things up. Good bot. >Pretty sad. Just shows that a lot of people are uninformed and don't realize how much damage capitalism has done to this country. Why do you hate the global poor?>Pretty crazy to think about how much money the working class were making just 40 years ago compared to now. And somehow you guys think that's good.Economic growth is great, yes! It's incredible just how far we've come in just the last 20 years. Lol there are people on other subs seriously saying she should have endorsed Bernie or Warren to attract the hidden socialist vote. > Being a lobbyist that lobbies for and works for the interest of the company is not a normal corporate career. It’s not several degrees of difference. I don't care about a guy being a lobbyist for Citigroup. I have no problem with Citigroup.>Where’s the explanation for the lobbyist that is against the 15 dollars minimum wage? Nothing wrong with being against a $15 minimum wage in my mind. I suppose the difference here is that I don't think having a normal corporate career and being connected to other companies through several degrees of difference irrevocably taints you.But then again, I don't really hate corporations to begin with.>If you have zero problems with these people, then I assume you have zero problems with Trumps picks of agencies.Nah, because I can get the difference between "works as an anti-EPA crusader" and "works at a huge national law firm that happens to have Monsanto as a client", but your bad faith argument is noted. So you don't understand what the rules committee actually does, is the problem, and most of us aren't tediously puritanical. I mean, come on, one of those criticisms is one guy works at a law firm that has Monsanto as a client? Another is complaining that a guy lobbies for Citigroup, which is a large investment organization that does all sorts of things. Ah yes, the mythical silent majority of secret socialists in red states who are just waiting for someone far left enough to come along to stop voting straight Republican. Please. It also doesn't help that Bernie presided over a VA health scandal during his time as VA committee chairman. Bernie has a track record of handling government run healthcare poorly already. I live in an area that's nearly a healthcare desert. Rapidly growing urban area with a severe shortage of physicians. Medicare 4 All would be a disaster for us. I don't get the point here. Are the Bernie Bros still whining about the rules committee stuff? Lol /r/politics banned me years ago for not worshiping their geriatric savior. That is going to depend on your personal beliefs and outlook on the world.Are you a liberal who believes in maximized freedom, civil liberties, trade, and international cooperation? Probably should join the Democratic Party. lmao that's fucking adorable. You realize the whole reason this sub exists is to give the rest of us a place to get away from ridiculous horseshit like that? Well, as a poster in /r/LiberalLGBT I love those things myself. Why are you here? > Meh. Would rather she endorse bernie or warrenThat would probably be a very, very bad move to make when running against Moscow Mitch in a red state. <3 > That said, is anyone actually worried about having a socialist government? Is anyone even advocating for it?Well, the Bernie Bros are for sure. Bernie was a socialist himself in the past and still widely considered one. Good bot. Absolutely nothing except, presumably, human decency and the fact that the Democratic Party has candidates pledge to support the eventual nominee. I believe that's how he won his first House seat though. He lost the Democratic nomination for Vermont's at-large House seat to a black woman in 1990, so he ran against her as an independent. That's far from a universal opinion considering how hard swiftboating hit John Kerry in 2004. It also makes it harder if not impossible to attack Trump based on his draft dodging if our candidate did pretty much the same thing. I know Vietnam vets who were pretty skeptical about the war even back then, but still served because they felt it was their duty to their country to do so. And it isn't helped by the fact that Bernie was doing jack shit back then anyways. He would have at least had meaningful employment if he'd served in Vietnam. Very few people are going to be impressed by a conscientious objector who avoided Vietnam so he could steal his neighbor's electricity.

You know how it goes with media influenced public discourse. It's a memetic kind of thing, and people will continue to bring it up.

I miss O'Malley. He was my definite second choice after Hillary in 2016. >It's not about the wineries and people who enjoy wine or "normal people" who attend fundraisers. Leave all that out of the conversation because it is just a distraction from the actual issue.Then people shouldn't bring it up. *I* wasn't the one who brought up the infamous wine cave fundraiser with billionaires and had to be corrected.>It is squarely about money buying influence in law and politics. It doesn't matter where it happens. *It matters that it does happen.*So you believe campaigns should be entirely publicly funded without accepting any outside contributions? I believe in that case the candidate you want to support is Bloomberg. Republicans have demonstrated more capacity to compromise than Sanders, hence the USMCA including concessions to labor and environmental concerns insisted on by the House and passing with bipartisan support.But you're correct that outside of that, they haven't accomplished much legislatively considering they control the judiciary, the Senate, and the White House. This is just a blatant lie. The rest of the first world is also liberal, capitalist democracies for the most part. It's also an irrelevant non sequitur even if it was true. >Wineries themselves aren't intrinsically bad. It's the fact that he was there in a room full of wealthy donorsThey weren't all wealthy donors. This has long since been debunked. https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/12/21/about-that-wine-cave-dinner-i-was-there/Normal people enjoy wine and wineries too, and even go to fundraisers for Democratic candidates. I'd far rather have someone who actually compromises to get stuff done rather than a notoriously inflexible idealist. That said, it's not really an issue of sacrificing ideals, because there are plenty of Democratic officials who have stood for things their entire career. Bernie just doesn't play well with others, which renders him singularly ineffective in a political system deliberately and explicitly designed to force people to compromise to advance legislation. >Also Buttigieg with his wine cavesDefinitely one of the most bizarre developments of this primary has been this weird idea that wineries are intrinsically bad. No, we can't, because most of us aren't Democratic socialists. I for one am a proud and enthusiastic capitalist. Bernie also refused to serve in Vietnam as a conscientious objector. Better than what Trump did, but still... Really repulsive, honestly. At some point these people are going to crash into the hard reality that a lot of us actually *like* Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. A church pastor and a North Carolina NAACP leader. How does Ni no Kuni II compare to the first game? This is such an outrageously good deal. > but will everyone in this sub work to unite democrats around him if he’s the candidate this election? I certainly hope so.I mean, sure we'll all vote for him in the general, for whatever good that will do when he makes Florida, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina solid red states. Off the top of my head, Nina Turner, his campaign co-chair, and Briahna Gray, his press secretary, both campaigned and voted for Jill Stein over Hillary Clinton. I think that's not all but that's all I can remember without googling it. Honestly most of us aren't that bad, but the far-left subreddits brigade us so hard. Wait is GW2 really on dx9? I could have sworn it was on 11. Where can I usually find crushed pork rind in stores? >So your complaint is he isnt a unifier?No, my complaint is that Bernie is either 1.) incompetent or 2.) accepts Trumpian behavior so long as it is from his supporters.>Biden wont be a unifier, nor buttigieg, or Warren, or Bloomber, or Yang, or Klobuchar, or Gabbard.None of those have their campaigns routinely attacking private citizens who criticize Bernie, Gabbards ridiculous lawsuit aside. You don't see Biden or Klobuchar's press secretaries doxxing people on Twitter or their endorsers leading boos against private citizens.>its necessarily divisive and toxic and all your whining wont stop it.I'm not trying to stop it. I'm just saying why I wont be doing any more for Bernie than reluctantly voting for him in a general election. No, I usually just wait for them to be on sale if I don't buy a complete edition. /r/democrats is not taking this well lmao > I'm not concerned with Rashida Tlaib booing Clinton (you know, a private citizen expressing distaste for a candidate that didnt support her). I'm concerned with this.We can be concerned about multiple things at once. My concern in this specific instance is Bernie's habit at promoting toxic elements of his campaign indicates he won't be any better at running the executive branch and actually getting stuff done. Congratulations on fucking yourselves over? I give it a year at least. This kind of stuff will take time to organize. Nooooooooooooo If you had read the article, you would have seen they made this decision based on the overwhelming support of union membership. Yeah it's called The Untamed. I've seen some of it but I prefer the donghua too. Also available in the US! >A black ship defies winter gales, bringing to young Carnelian’s remote island of exile three masked Lords of the Chosen—a cruel ruling caste. These Masters beg his father to return with them to oversee the election of a new God Emperor. To repair their ship, they pillage and destroy Carnelian’s home—the only world he’s ever known—condemning his people to starve. He and his father embark with the visitors on a long and perilous journey—against deadly opposition—to Osrakum, the heart and wonder of the world and seat of absolute power. I'm not a union member, so telling me that doesn't change this situation at all. If I had to guess, I'd say their opinions are formed by more than just the polls. Yes, because the union's membership disagrees with your premise. Honestly I'm at the point where I don't think I'll be able to lie to people that Bernie would be a good president. A Sanders administration will be a global trainwreck. >What ever happened to supporting the candidate who's policy you beleive in.It's pretty meaningless if you can't get elected in the first place. >The aid package worked. The Mexican economy began growing again within a year, and Mexico paid back the loan in full, plus $600M in interest, 3 years ahead of schedule. It is always a good policy to be a good neighbor 🇺🇸🇲🇽. The sheer hatred is really just frightening and bizarre. A private citizen expresses a negative opinion about a politician, so his campaign's response is to start holding Two Minutes Hate against her? Beyond Bernie's whole infatuation with socialism, this kind of thing leaves me scared of what will happen if Bernie wins the nom.He'll be better than Trump, but it seems like every day he finds a new bottom. Fuck but these people are terrible. Excellent character development of Wang Lin and all of the more important side characters like Xuan Luo, All-Seer, Mu Bingmei. Lots of foreshadowing of a major twist that comes right at the end of the story. Sure, it can get repetitive but it's not so bad considering how the trouble Wang Lin runs into has so much variety. Ironic, here's one of them now /u/Epicduck_ As you can see, they got awfully angry that not everyone shares their hatred of police. I just got caught up to the latest season of Chinese animation adaptation of a M/M fantasy novel called Mo Dao Zu Shi. Here is a trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZieWI6suDYWe are blessed in that Tencent has graciously brought the series with English and other language subtitles to the US completely for free in HD. Here is Season 1, Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m346FShZ5Dc&list=PLMX26aiIvX5rWjEqareJBmoX-_uTFtemkJust turn on Youtube's closed captions in the language of your choice. It's still early in the story when the romance isn't so much of a factor, but the animators have been dropping small but significant hints that there are **feelings** in the story.The animation is very good. It is very popular both in and outside of China and has won multiple awards.Here is the official translation of the novel, which is uncensored and has full blown sex scenes: https://exiledrebelsscanlations.com/novels/grandmaster-of-demonic-cultivation/The blurb: >As the grandmaster who founded the Demonic Sect, Wei WuXian roamed the world in his wanton ways, hated by millions for the chaos he created. In the end, he was backstabbed by his dearest [younger brother] and killed by powerful clans that combined to overpower him. He incarnates into the body of a lunatic who was abandoned by his clan and is later, unwillingly, taken away by a famous cultivator among the clans—Lan WangJi, his archenemy. This marks the start of a thrilling yet hilarious journey of attacking monsters, solving mysteries, and raising children. From the mutual flirtation along the way, Wei WuXian slowly realizes that Lan WangJi, a seemingly haughty and indifferent poker-face, holds more feelings for Wei WuXian than he is letting on. > Or they can be vocal about not liking it while trying to get a company to change there practices. Then they can still enjoy cruises.Of course they *can*, I just happen to think that's pretty disgusting behavior. I'd guess more people agree than not. Stiffing lower-income workers is generally seen as socially unacceptable.>Arguably them going on a cruise and not tipping probably has a bigger impact than writing a letter If enough people didn't tip than the employees would complain.Have you never worked in customer service? As long as the employees are meeting whatever minimum wage exists for tipped workers in their jurisdiction, if any, they aren't going to give a shit. It seems to me that the obvious solution for anyone who feels that strongly about the issue would be *to not cruise* to deny the company their money, not go out of their way to fuck over those workers they claim to care about after the line has gotten their fare... Cradle is good, but it's hardly the best xianxia out there. Some of the "weird stuff" like face, filial piety, and daoism are pretty intinsic to the genre that Cradle excludes. It's a good Western take, but I don't think even Wright would say it's really the best of what inspired it.Best xianxias are probably novels like Renegade Immortal, Reverend Insanity, World of Cultivation, Desolate Era, Mo Dao Zu Shi. Slay queen!!!! How much longer do I have to wait for the donghua season 3 trailer? I finished season 2 and am going into withdrawal? >I align with Democrats on nearly all other issues, but abortion is a big point of divergence for me.>What's a guy like me to do in the upcoming election? Trump's gotta go.Vote blue, don't get an abortion yourself, and support improving access to contraception at all levels of society, expanding WIC, and providing comprehensive sex education. >Socialists would rather have the poor poorer provided the rich were less rich--PM Margaret ThatcherObviously Thatcher was very wrong about many things, but broken clock and all that. This quote of hers describes Bernie, Warren, and the "Revolution" very well to my thinking. Oh it is. It's just fun because sometimes it gets turned around and your main character does it too. /r/fantasy maintains a google spreadsheet of LGBT fantasy btw: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1roLOB8OZm34XjzVyDmH5fyWiPKGYy8i9EzRuhBMZauo/edit#gid=0 I mean, yeah. They're the villains for a reason. Of course you could read a xianxia where Side A wins the fight and the protagonist vows revenge and then comes back several arcs later and slaughters Side A's entire family. :) The Belgariad by David Eddings. He acknowledged in the foreword to the omnibus edition that the whole thing is a huge trope quest. His whole writing style is basically tropes are common because they're enjoyable, so he tries to write good trope-y fantasy. You're better off not knowing. What a gud boi! Thanks for keeping our communities safe! 🤗 This subreddit gets brigaded by far left subs like /r/chapotraphouse, unfortunately. Is there any actual evidence of men crying over conservative speakers on college campus? This might be kinda nitpicky, but given the extent of State control over many sectors of the economy in Russia, I'd hesitate to label it capitalist in even a loose sense. "Red Army".Grandma is a commie confirmed. I think Amy will wait to see how Iowa goes and makes her decision based on that. If she doesn't do well, I think she'll do the right thing and drop out to endorse Biden. In *Minnesota*? Lmao not happening. Really sad to see this. Delaney was one of the best in the field in terms of policy. I appreciated him standing up for trade when so much of the Democratic party seems to be embracing protectionism and an isolationist role towards the United States in the world. F Thanks for answering seriously. As an American, it's really embarrassing how many redditors don't realize that not everyone on Reddit is an American, or following the American Democratic primary in it's early stages. The article addresses that. > but her unwillingness to work to free him is troubling....What exactly is she supposed to do? She's a US Senator, but the kid wasn't tried by the federal government so her office doesn't have any connection with the case at this point. Okay. Sounds like something they can work out appeal, then. Definitely. We really need better history education. :( Opposition to socialism isn't even really that limited to older and moderates. Reddit has a bizarre preoccupation with pretending that it isn't extreme politically. >Bernie is a great unknown. And a lot of people don't feel like taking a risk against trump. Precisely. Also, after four years of Trump's disorder, I don't want another guy who is going to "bern it all down", just from the left this time. I want a steadying influence and a committed liberal, not a revolutionary quasi-socialist. It would be hard for me to vote for a socialist in the general election, and that's as a lifelong committed Democratic voters. It would be a disastrous proposition for independents and moderates. I don't think Reddit really grasps that a lot of people remember communism, are refugees from communist or socialist states, and/or have read 20th century history. Does this woman have an actual job at this point or does she just hang around her alma mater campus like a weirdo harassing strangers? Then you shouldn't be basing your electoral strategy around the ficklest demographic in the country. No. I mean, they're going to find some excuse to do that no matter what. Nah, he actually hates Bernie now. He's a full blown magatard who rants on Twitter how Bernie betrayed the revolution by endorsing Hillary. I'm not sure whether to hate or be thrilled that I can follow these comments. This is basically my response when I saw this.https://twitter.com/CascadianFyn/status/1222696722993836032?s=20 It's nice to see a politician with a normal, healthy relationship with the press these days. I look forward to seeing how he does with the Cuban community in Florida given the whole loving communist regimes thing. >I don't think I'm an asshole, I just think I'm young and don't know how to deal with death. YTAYou're twenty fucking two, not eight. To be honest you should really think hard about whether you're emotionally mature enough to be in an adult relationship. I would bet money Bernie wouldn't make it to 2024 to face a primary myself. I don't think so? I've never talked to this person, they just PM'ed me out of the blue. You know, I could *kinda* see the first two. The next two are random and senseless and don't make any sense in a critique of capitalism. The next two are the exact *opposite* in that capitalism has been one of the greatest drivers of *closing* the wealth gap and ending global poverty... I'm fine with decriminalizing it, and being legalized with precautions on distribution and use. NTA and my god /r/justnofil and /r/justnoso The crazy thing is, for the most part, even the *Nazis* on trial realized how stupid it would be to try to pretend given the preponderance of evidence that killing Jews never happened. They defenses all hinged on "I was just following orders" or that they hadn't personally known at the time. Oh wow, a Holocaust denier in the wild, and on the International Day of Holocaust Remembrance no less. The only thing that could possibly get me to vote for a socialist is Trump's neo-fascism, which means Bernie will be slightly less of a disaster for the US and the world. > The "both sides" narrative would become TRUE if we let him lead our partyFor those wondering: Bernie was a literal fucking Trotskyist at the height of the Cold War when the Soviet Union was killing countless people and shipping them off to gulags. > I'm honestly getting concerned about what a Sanders presidency would look likeSocialism, economic turmoil, continuing abandonment of US foreign policy fundamentals, more turmoil after he dies in office in his first term. His successor, probably one of his sycophants, will be in over their head and lose dramatically to a GOP challenger, who will probably be someone promising to return the nation to something approximating normalcy. Rubin is genuinely one of the few principled conservatives worth respecting in the US at this point, sadly enough. > If the modding community had their own ~~nine~~ eight divines Enai would be one of them.FTFY you heretic. >10 Y/O Loli Realm LordYou jest, but one of those literally showed up towards the end of Renegade Immortal lmao. > I don’t trust TGC to be unbiased about reporting on this.Oh lol I didn't even notice the original link was from The Gospel Coalition. They aren't exactly what I'd call a neutral source. It's because of the toxic promotion culture at Google. Legacy product support is very looked down on. If you aren't working on something cool and new you are essentially seen as wasting your time, so teams feel they have no choice but to kill existing products so they can say they're making something new so they can move ahead. I seriously thought about pre-ordering it just because I think cloud gaming is such a great idea, but now I'm thrilled I avoided this shit show. Weirdly I've *never* heard anyone in my building have sex. I can't tell if the insulation is just really that incredible or if I'm the loud and obnoxious neighbor. >You really think real Bernie supporters are racist?At least some, sure. God knows there was a shit ton of it on Reddit back in 2016.>I mean his whole movement is based on helping the working class which has a large minority population. lol where do you come up with this?Real life unfortunately. You can't just pretend that Sanders supporters don't have a reputation of being pretty abusive towards women and people of color who don't support him when we can watch it play out with our own eyes. Sorry I don't think racism is acceptable. 🙄 Hillary's flair is "Queen", not crown princess though. >Whether or not you embrace Clinton as your champion, the takeaway from these four hours — and the hoopla surrounding them — is that as a lifelong advocate for causes in which she believes, she isn't going away anytime soon.♥️♥️♥️ Personal attacks on other redditors are not acceptable. This comment has been removed. If you're going to continue participating here, review the rules. Absolutely. Most Democratic voters are moderates. I'd recommend checking out /r/centerleftpolitics or /r/neoliberal. There's also a New Democrat subreddit that I can't remember the name of.The issue is that extremist politics in general is popular on Reddit, so it can seem like everyone is either a white nationalist or a socialist, but that's not at all what it's like in real life. It's really sad that so many of the Extremely Online can't grasp that in the world, Hillary, like Obama, still has a strong base of supporters who deeply admire her. Bernie, though he seems to make it harder by the day with his embrace of socialism and stuff like the Cenk Uyger and Rogan endorsements. >and not the highest polling democratic candidate right now.What does Biden have to do with this?... NTAThis is appallingly rude and I think you're right in regards to it being a cash grab. I would have also kept the gift card. Frankly I think you were gracious enough to not just leave immediately. >You're voting Biden, it's funny you think you even have a leg to stand on here, but please, enlighten me as to how Biden is somehow better for the LGBT community than Sanders.Biden actually gets stuff done. >Who are you voting for?Biden.>Literally no other politician running in the primaries has as good of a record as Sanders has when it comes to LGBT rights, race relations / rights, trans rights, women's rights, workers rights, and pretty much anything that helps normal people.Haha no.>People expect to tear down Sanders for acknowledging the endorsement of a dodgy podcast host (Who has a big audience), due to the things he has said in individual episodes (I doubt that Sanders has watched every single one of them to find out whether to acknowledge the endorsement),There's a big difference between just getting endorsed, and promoting that endorsement on your Twitter account. I'd really really like Google Fiber, but I have At&T, and it's been acceptable for me. I hate how locked out of my router I am, but I've had decent service and haven't noticed any crazy fees.I'm not exactly blown away by the service either though. Would jump ship for something better for sure. Personal anecdote, but my defense contractor office has been pretty hostile towards Trump ever since his government shut down last year. I was fine, but it stressed everyone out and lots of people know peeps at NASA who got fucked by it. On the very rare occasions when politics comes up the general consensus seems to be that Trump is a moron who is bad for business. Is Phase 3 well regarded? I've been looking through their website and it looks pretty good, and it has a lap pool even. >She is touting herself as the unity candidate, and previously maintained a friendship with Sanders, she's also falling in the polls. If she believed what she said, she probably would drop out and support Sanders.Why? She's dropping in the polls, but she just picked up a key endorsement in the *Des Moines Register*. There's no reason to drop out right before Iowa. If she can get over 15% in the caucuses she'll almost certainly see no reason to drop out.>Finally, Rogan. Sanders acknowledged the endorsement, is that a crime?No, it just makes him seem to have really horrible judgment and disgusts a lot of us who aren't sympathetic to misogynist racists like his campaign seems to be. Absolutely. I imagine it is kind of that sort of selection with more liberal millennials leaving Christianity altogether, so what are left trend more conservative and end up in places like ACNA. But still, support for same-sex marriage is at 74% (as of last year) among millennials, and that's only going to keep going up. https://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/ >"When Nancy repeatedly held the line, she was absolutely right because we had to build a case and we had to demonstrate as clearly as you could that the behavior threatened the security, the sovereignty, the integrity of our country and most particularly, our elections," Clinton said.Yas slay queen!!! Many of our members don't like Bernie Sanders, that is correct. Also non-Christian religions in general. I believe I read somewhere that one of the fastest growing religions these days in the US at least is paganism and/or Wicca specifically. It's really interesting to watch it play out. I'm always curious where the rationale for "We're hemorrhaging younger members at break neck pace, so we should become harsher towards gay people" comes from. As another one, I read. No, seriously, just casually read. Like some nonfiction. It becomes rapidly apparent that Bernie and his fans are completely disconnected from reality. I mean, people did. I remember in 2017 some people graffitied a HBCU with "hey [nword] Bernie would have won this is YOUR fault" shortly after the inauguration. To be completely honest, even I'd have a hard time voting for Bernie, much less more conservative people in swing states. Socialism and Communism are among the most disastrous ideologies in human history. That Bernie not only supported it at the height of the Cold War, but he and his fans want to go back to it, is really disqualifying.I'll probably still vote for Bernie, but he's not really much better than Trump. I generally assume /r/antiwork and /r/SandersForPresident is basically a circle. The horseshoe is real. :( I'm so glad that guy is fucking dead. I'd like to remind everyone that canonically, Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange fucked. There was nobody "doing Biden's bidding", because Biden isn't corrupt. >and they will happily tolerate any amount of bigotry against women, people of color, lgbt, etc., so long as it furthers their economic goals.I mean... Isn't that the case with real communists too? I remember getting to the end of the novel and Jin Guangyao, Lan Xichen, and everyone else there were so fucking astonished he didn't get it yet that Jin Guangyao had to straight up take a break from his plan of world domination to explain it to Wei Wuxian. It really is bizarre. Also Delaney and Klobuchar. Rumor also has it that Harris is considering endorsing Biden. >Facts are considered hate?It's a common persecution complex on Reddit, unfortunately. >Kaine was squeaky clean and friendly but did nothing special for the ticket.Kaine secured Virginia, which was exactly what her campaign wanted. I'm not sure audio where Trump agrees that Bernie's trade policy is just as terrible as his own is a great moment for Bernie. Yikes Nice It's not surprising that a brutal authoritarian government with an extensive history of denying reality isnt the best at confronting disasters. Why bother? It's ridiculously obvious that Trump is doing it because he's desperate for some kind of accomplishment, but Space Command already existed as part of the Air Force before this. For those wondering: https://twitter.com/JimSwiftDC/status/1221107889764536326 > How many of those do you think there are? one per state? five? twenty? fifty? Ever heard of anyone who hired between 50 and 2500 people and didnt have to fire any of them for turning out to be an asshole?Yes. Bernie is the only primary candidate who keeps hiring assholes and Stein voters to lead his campaign. > Do you think Bernie Sanders flys all over the U.S. and personally conducts interviews with hundreds of thousands of people that play a role in his campaign? I think he interviews his senior staffers, yes. You said it was a done deal in response to "You left out **civil rights and** women’s rights for a reason I guess".Please don't lie about what was said in this thread when it's really easy to fact check. > If either Bernie or Elizabeth dropped out, the other would be all but gaurunteed the nomination.That's not how it works. Warren dropping out doesn't get Bernie 100% of her supporters. He's alienated quite a few of them, and her base of support overlaps with Buttigieg already. No, probably not. Why would she at this point? To endorse Bernie? Seems pretty unlikely both after Bernie called her a liar on national television and then tweeted about being endorsed by Rogan. If I had to guess that will be something she wants to stay far clear of. I talked about them both, independently, in the same comment, yes. That doesn't mean I'm conflating them. >and Bernie is horrible for accepting his endorsement apparentlyI mean, yeah, Bernie has a pretty consistent history of promoting some pretty awful people and ideologies. At the very least he seems to have pretty poor judgment in regards to hiring, which is a big concern for a lot of us after how disastrous "I'll hire the best people" Trump has been. > Abortion is its own issue Abortion rights is women's rights.>And don't co-opt LGBT rights as being about women.I didn't. Is there any need to? The US President just attended an antichoice rally what, yesterday? LGBT rights have been under continuous attack for years now. The idea that women's or lgbt rights have been achieved is farcical on its face. Ideally: rejoining the Paris Agreement, reinstating Obama's fuel efficiency standards, reinstating DARPA-E research funding, introducing and fast tracking legislation for carbon cap and trade, incentivizing private investment into nuclear as well as energy. Well, the whole point the article makes is that not all candidates' supporters act the same on social media. > Going back to nuclear power wouldn't be radical and would go a huge distance to solving the problem. But no one wants that.I believe actually that Yang has come out specifically in favor of expanding nuclear energy. Wish more of the candidates like Buttigieg and Biden would.

It isn't offensive when given as an example of unacceptable behavior, but in the context you used it in. I'm not going to continue belaboring this point in the comments, take it to modmail if you want. Yes, I quoted the one part that violated the rules to you so you know which behavior not to repeat in the future. > It's not a leading civil rights organization? ...Yes, it is. This really isn't open for debate. It has an extensive history of fighting for LGBT rights for decades, has a national reach, and is a major endorsement in politics.>What exactly does that even mean? It means Bernie Sander's campaign just committed a major unforced error right as primary voting is beginning by drawing the criticism of a respected civil rights org with a broad audience and generating negative press for himself.>I want to hear the emperical basis for your hypothesis?The empirical basis for my hypothesis is that Joe Rogan is a bigot who [calls black people apes](https://www.mediaite.com/politics/joe-rogans-bernie-endorsement-draws-outrage-as-clip-surfaces-comparing-black-neighborhood-to-planet-of-the-apes/), says [feminist men should die](https://twitter.com/joerogan/status/320006249456492545), says [trans women aren't real women,](https://www.fightopinion.com/2013/03/15/joe-rogan-fallon-fox/), is [a 9/11 truther](http://www.mediafiledc.com/time-end-joe-rogan-experience/), and [uses homophobic slurs](https://www.sbnation.com/2010/11/23/2324963/ufc-commentator-joe-rogan-uses-anti-gay-slur-towards-reporter), and Bernie Sanders was just blasted by the leader of a respected civil rights organization that has millions of direct social media followers, which has already been reported by the national media. >That's a pretty huge assumption.>Bernie and Warren are unlike anything we've seen before. Not really, the Democratic Party has run very far left candidates in the past. Admittedly none as relatively far left as Bernie, but it's not like his progressive stance and policies are unique. > He's not racist, he just isn't that smart and doesn't always think before talking. His endorsement will only help These two claims do not mesh together particularly well. >Because they didn't have the same philosophy or agenda in the 70s 90s or even 2000s as they do now...ithere were very different circumstances as recent as 5 years ago. That's a complete change of topic.>I'm still waiting for your perspective. I've given you my background what about yours?? What's ur point? Do you think Bernie cares if anything its helping him.Bernie being called out by one of the nation's leading civil rights organizations is not going to help him...>Again,..who are you?...Are you expecting me to give you my actual name or something? So I just finished the novel, and maybe I just lost track, but where did Suibian end up? It's the only thing Wei Wuxian has from Uncle FengMian and from his childhood in the YunmengJiang Sect...Also, why does Wei Wuxian wear black and red instead of the purple uniform of the YunmengJiang Sect? > Not bizarre at all, the 2 individuals from those organizations are both under 40...........yeah. It's almost like the Human Rights Campaign has had more than one leader since it was founded in 1980. Like people get old, retire, move to different jobs.>and they haven't been around for 40 years, They were literally founded in the 80's. We can all look this information up really easily. I'm not sure what you get out of saying something so blatantly untrue. >yapping her mouth This is not an acceptable way to speak of women speaking out, regardless of the political views involved. This comment has been removed. I've listened to enough of Joe Rogan to realize that he's pretty bigoted, yes. > By the way those 2 organizations criticizing Joe are really a joke. I looked at their social media sites the barely get a 100 likesThis is a really bizarre thing to say. It's not true, but even if it was, it is completely irrelevant. Does the significance of an organization which has been at the forefront of LGBT rights for 40 years really depend on how many likes they get on Facebook to you? > I dont understand why this is even picking up tractionBecause a Presidential candidate is being criticized by a leading national civil rights group for promoting his endorsement by a man who compares black people to apes, says trans women aren't real women, and has a history of fairly extreme sexism against women.>becuz he thinks trans men shouldn't fight women in mma or athleticsNo. I'm going to encourage you to read [the subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/about/rules/) on having civil conversations with others, see specifically rule #8. While you may disagree with me and other users on issues under debate in the primary, that does not give you license to attack other Redditors. That is a rather uncharitable interpretation of all he said. What, specifically, in his comment do you see as him wanting the author to "get out" of TEC? > Of course she did. Methodists and Lutherans are both multi-denominational families whose numbers dwarf Episcopalians in the US. The Missouri Synod alone is bigger than the Episcopal Church. The various Anglican splinter groups have even smaller numbers than Episcopalians do, and at least as much theological diversity between them as do the various brands of either Methodists or Lutherans. What about outreach to the Swedenborgians or the Metropolitan Community Church? That would be at least as challenging from the numerical standpoint as outreach to ACNA et. al., but without the added disadvantage dialogue with ACNA et. al. would face. Namely, as the author himself notes from experience a few paragraphs up, that the neo-Anglican denominations were founded specifically in opposition to the Episcopal Church, in many cases by people who not only don't want anything to do with us, but (like the "internationally recognized" bishop-theologian) don't want anything to do with anyone who will have anything to do with us!As an aside, I always find it interesting how these articles *always* put all the expectation for compromise and progress in dialogue on TEC et al, and never ACNA or whichever GAFCON member is under discussion. And if anyone comments on the double standard, usually there's some condescending remark about how ACNA and/or GAFCON shouldn't be expected to reach out or compromise because "they're holding to biblical values" or some equivalent banality as if TEC isn't doing the exact same thing from their theological perspective. The Onion has been pretty meh for years, honestly. When was the last time one of their articles or videos really got much attention? A few years by now? The HRC is one of the leading national LGBT civil rights organizations. It's a pretty big deal for them to be publicly calling out a candidate's campaign lol. > It's so ridiculous, there marginalizing who Rogan is ..he makes great points, hes not always right abt things, but the dems Wait, you actually think the Human Rights Campaign is a part of the Democratic Party?... > need to make it so that Moiraine and Siuan aren't former lovers in the TV show.

But it's not really fiscally responsible or politically possible.>Your framing of things to be maximally damaging to progressives is blatantI am just sharing and commenting on the analysis put out by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a non-partisan think-tank. Do you think sharing the news is offensive? >and wrong given that it is not even a good faith argument.I didn't make an argument in the above comment, I just answered your question of why people were concerned about adding trillions of dollars more in federal spending. Let's please keep things civil. Just because I have a differing opinion on healthcare policy and shared a news story that doesn't support Bernie and Warren's agenda isn't something to take personally. Because the expense is a core issue to most voters. I'm reading a history book about World War II right now, and whenever there's something about a U-boat being sunk with all hands lost it puts a huge shit-eating grin on my face.On that note, [here is a picture](https://external-preview.redd.it/20CM9ngLsly5rxGQ7jQ4ZLZ56CgEYAdnFMVnuGssfIg.jpg?s=46cf593f849d497d580464873ed3ebd1ec0b623c) of two great Americans showing what Nazis deserve. Either that, or a Darkfriend, so the incredibly suspicious way she gloms on to Perrin in *The Great Hunt* for no apparent reason actually makes sense. I imagine the latest scandal of them violating the rules of their charity status by hoarding billions of dollars didn't help.

I love Wheel of Time but there's plenty about it that I really don't mind them not sticking exactly to the books on.Like we could honestly cut 90% of the Faile kidnapped by the Shaido and Perrin chasing them around the central kingdoms arc, which took up 2-3 books at least. That's what you get when you argue in bad faith. I love this salt. >I made one initially about NPR doing it. That was my first comment on the subject:Yeah, as I said, you don't explain anything. You just insist NPR is misappropriating jazz and everyone is confused.> As long as they have their wine caves and their jazz, what's the difference.Well, there's nothing wrong with them having "wine caves" and jazz. If anything, participating in cultural activities is a good thing. It is a thing, but you've made precisely zero arguments for NPR doing it. You haven't even explained *what* they're doing that is so heinous beyond vague rambling about jazz being "absorbed into the belly", whatever the fuck that means.And given my enthusiastic support for globalism, I bet my threshold for people enjoying and appreciating the culture that originated with others is a lot higher than yours. Really what we need is a world where everyone can participate in blóts dressed in kimono while listening to jazz in the background and then going off to discuss Tang dynasty poetry and the works of Jin Yong vs Tolkien. Then my generation, also millennials, should vote more. Those assholes how *dare* they enjoy jazz? RIP the Thrawn trilogy, the Yuuzhan Vong, the Kilik series, the one where Jacen becomes an alt-right Sith edgelord, and the whole crazy series where the Sith escape a planet where they've been marooned for thousands of years and help Luke and the Jedi fight space Cthulhu who wants to suck their brains out or something. "The Salad surges within me, such bliss!" Such is Christianity in general these days. The CoE is at least moderately better on the subject than most. > If anyone is outraged by this article, I hope they were outraged before as well, because nothing has changed.I don't think anyone will be particularly outraged, but that doesn't mean people won't be disappointed. > I think people would care a lot less if Hillary said she would endorse Bernie Sanders (or any Democrat) for the nomination.She did... https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/1219773503735508992>Or maybe if she said that she didn't like Bernie instead of "no one likes Bernie." Sure he's controversial, but Sanders has an enthusiastic base of supporters, and friends & family if nothing else.That's true, but she was talking about in the context of his colleagues in the Senate, and she wasn't super specific which caused people to be confused. I'm just going to drop this here. https://www.thebeaverton.com/2020/01/breaking-woman-who-has-absorbed-decades-of-unhinged-misogynist-vitriol-does-not-like-one-guy/And as a regular poster on /r/hillaryclinton, it's fucking weird how often we're brigaded by people who in the same comment will insist they *really* don't care about what Hillary has to say. I think the closest I've ever seen to self-deprecation from Bernie is his weird as fuck rant with the NYT where he rants that he's bad at basic social interactions like wishing people happy birthday. I *think* he meant it to be somewhat funny in a "haha I'm such a devoted worker" kind of way, but it really just came across like Bernie is a mean person who doesn't give a shit about others. So are we still being brigaded by the Bernie bros? Lots of removed comments in here. It's a Democratic legend. Darth Hillary was a Dark Lord of the Democrats, so powerful and so wise she could use the Force to influence the American political process to create responsible liberal policy… SLAY QUEEN! Ok boomer We've been getting brigaded a lot lately, unfortunately. >Some of the House’s most influential progressives, including Reps. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) and Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), said they will contribute tens of thousands of dollars to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, despite a contentious new rule that blacklists campaign consultants who work for candidates taking on sitting Democratic members.>The decision by the co-chairs of the Congressional Progressive Caucus represents a thawing of monthslong tensions with DCCC Chairwoman Cheri Bustos (Ill.), who had fiercely defended the policy over bitter objections from high-profile Democrats like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-N.Y.). Good. It's really horrible that in the midst of a fight to salvage what we can of our nation that some choose to fight their colleagues in the Party. They once upvoted literal North Korean state propaganda to the top. Independents really are the worst. > no one was that excited about Hillary.It's honestly weird to me that people keep repeating this falsehood. Lots of us were very excited about Hillary, we just weren't super vocal on Reddit 24/7 because you really couldn't express anything other than undying adulation to Lord Bernie without the Bros freaking the fuck out. I don't remember it happening very fast though. From what I recall most of the summer all of Reddit was dealing with the Bernie Bros melting down. Oh wow, a literal Assadist in the wild. >“Because Sanders set up Our Revolution and they have raised and spent money in candidate elections, Our Revolution is required to comply with contribution limits, register with the FEC and discloses its donors — but it hasn't," said Paul S. Ryan, an attorney for Common Cause. “It's his establishment of the group that triggers these laws. That means a $5,000 limit, full donor disclosure and no contributions from prohibited sources." That actually sounds super delicious. Yeah, it's pretty good. The MC isn't quite as clever or ruthless as the description makes him seem. If you really want the ultra-evil slaughter MC, read Reverend Insanity. But Leylin is still fairly smart in comparison to other MCs and has a few good tricky plots that are really fun to read. >“Vice President Biden has proven again and again that he is a friend to union ironworkers,” said Eric Dean, the union’s general president, in a statement. “We need a president who will defend rights and jobs of American workers, and Joe Biden will be that president.” Congratulations? >Do these people actually existSo much has been written about how many, many Democratic voters love Biden and far prefer his policies to the more progressive candidates. These kind of comments just serve to make you look wilfully ignorant at this point. I didn't say that's why she lost, you illiterate troll. Are you genuinely this dense or are you just pretending? The point is that it's not that impressive, and Hillary also switched to support Obama *days* after she lost the primary, not *months*.https://www.wsj.com/articles/bernie-sanders-wont-endorse-hillary-clinton-for-now-1466798302Bernie ratfucked the election by dragging the primary out for months after he was eliminated and continuing to attack Hillary and the Party to boost his own book sales. > According to advice from Rick Wilson - the best for the next year would be if Hillary is neither seen or heard until the inauguration of the Democratic president in 2021.Lol. Hillary *already tried that and it did not work*. It's weird how people forget stuff that only happened a couple years ago.>He believes the race is already very hard to win and no unforced errors allowed.I agree, Bernie and AOC should resign from Congress immediately, and Bernie should drop out.

She spends far too much time with grandstanding lies like this: https://www.newsweek.com/aoc-says-democratic-party-center-conservative-party-adds-we-dont-have-left-party-us-1483218 > Will Hillary campaign for Bernie? Will you? Maybe. Bernie is a socialist, which isn't much better than Trump. I'll vote for him but lying to people about Bernie being some glowing hope for America is probably too dishonest for me to handle. Bernie will do fine on stuff like education and criminal justice, but he's going to fail hard on fighting climate change, the economy, and foreign affairs. It'll be dismal, so our hope will be that Pelosi and Schumer and his handlers can contain his foolishness for the few years he'll be in office until we can replace him with an actual liberal Democratic president.> Beating Trump is all that matters and you seem to be endorsing himEndorsing Bernie? God I hope not, he's a terrible person. I'm backing Joe Biden. >so it's been a long while since I was interested in her unvarnished views./r/NobodyAsked > then maybe think before you give an answer like that. She did. The first sentence is sarcasm.> She can't undo it for all of her devout followers.And we wouldn't want her to. Sarcastic Hillary is the best Hillary. 😍 I dislike her pretty intensely myself, but I don't get what the troll thinks she has to do with anything. "You guys just don't understand, it was BERNIE'S TURN!!!" It's weird that Bernie Bros constantly harp on this as if campaigning for the nominee isn't the bare minimum expected. Wow, the Bros really didn't like this post, did they? https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/581/698/fe1.png This has been a glorious day for content on this sub. >“I just can’t understand why she’d feel the need to lash out,” said /u/cheebear12 of Reddit, of a woman who, during the 2016 election, was routinely impersonated at rallies by lookalikes in cages at whom attendees could hurl abuse. “Can’t she see that this isn’t about her?” It's honestly embarrassing how stupid they are. Slay QUEEN!!! Sassy Hillary is the best Hillary <3 It's unfortunate, but Reddit tends to have a very myopic view of the world. Bernie Sanders is popular with young people on the internet. so they make the mistake of not realizing that Redditors are a very tiny portion of the American electorate, most of whom hasn't forgotten the atrocities of socialism in the past. > Bernie did 40 campaign events for Hillary after she was nominated in 2016Bernie refused to drop out for multiple months after he was defeated and continued to attack Hillary up to the convention.>The only people saying that they're unsure about their vote are moderate Dems like Hillary Bernie's own *top staffers* are actual literal Bernie or Busters who voted for Jill fucking Stein, so this is an absurd thing to say. It's just a straight out lie. >Or you could view it as why did get close to begin with. In a year he went from 2% to 43%.That isn't close. I'm not sure highlighting the fact that after decades in Congress as a career politician he was essentially a nobody and none of his colleagues supported him is the praise you think it is. >Bernie has more individual donors than Obama did. If he gets the Dem nomination, I have no doubt the turnout will follow.The problem with this thesis is that you *first* have to get the turnout to win the nomination, and Bernie lost in a landslide to Hillary, which I'd say is pretty strong evidence against you there. >So all young people are dumbNo, I didn't remotely say anything like that.>and not worth inspiring to vote? Not really, from a strategic perspective. Low return on investment. Bernie banked hard on the young vote in 2016 and lost in a landslide. There's no reason to think now in 2020 with an even smaller base of support that he'll do better.>They're Americans, eligible to vote, and deserving of representation.I know. They should vote more often. >Young people didn't turn out for Hillary like they did for Obama because Hillary actively chided them during the campaign.I'm not sure "young people are petty and self centered" is a great point for you to be making. Also literally no candidate has had turnout like Obama, so that's not really a meaningful criticism. As someone who voted in every single election while in college, this would be a lot more meaningful if most of my peers hasn't responded to me mentioning that I'd voted with a dumb, glazed over stare and a "there was an election today?" Or an "oops I forgot to fill out my ballot oh well".And we aren't talking about school board special elections or arcane tax measures either. This happened during midterms after Obama. >I got news for you buddyDesertion was a massive problem even among the Allies. It was far from impossible for a conscript to defect or just run away. Fortunately for us, all the actual evidence in the real world does not agree with you. :) "Innocent Wehrmacht" is an oxymoron. Well, yeah, I think Bernie and what he had done to the Democratic Party over the last several years is awful.>It's absolutely disgraceful that you're accusing a sitting US Democratic SenatorBernie is literally not a Democratic Senator. He's an independent. They're okay. It's a nicely written series, but as an adult you'll likely find the religious message very ham-handed. It honestly baffles me how Google fucked this up so *badly*. NTAThis is a huge violation, and she's an adult. If you can't trust her in your home it's entirely reasonable to have her go live with her father. I would keep in touch but I guess there's a huge backstory behind all of this.And I'm sorry you got so much crap in this thread. Reddit tends to be very young and rather immature. Lmao so many amazing leaps in here. You really want OP to be the bad guy here. Tbh this does kind of smack of taking both sides. There's one side that wants to essentially tear a lot of things down and radically alter our society and economy, and there's another that wants a return to the way things were under Obama and to build from there. You can't have both, but at least they managed to narrow it down to one from each, I guess. Definitely better than something idiotic than endorsing the entire top four.But really I wish Hillary was running. They endorsed Klobuchar because at least on some level they have to acknowledge that Warren has gone so hard left that many people won't support her, and would rather have a return to normalcy than even more radical change. Obviously. The point is there are other forms of power in the electrical industry that would have a far greater ROI. The net economic benefits of coal, when you consider the enormous human labor and transportation costs, environmental remediation of the mines, healthcare for workers and those affected, pollution cleanup, and offsetting climate action, are minimal.We could offer subsidies for horse-drawn buggies too and support a whole industry of horse breeding and livery stables. We don't because that would be fucking stupid. As long as it isn't a lie, like the Sanders campaign video and newsletter were and you aren't telling people not to vote for him in the general, sure. Disinformation, and dividing Democrats is against the rules in this subreddit. The video wasn't edited, but it was a short clip that omits the context in which Biden is mocking the subject he is discussing. So yes, it was "untouched", but that's pure sophistry.https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2020/jan/09/bernie-sanders/did-biden-laud-paul-ryan-proposal-cut-social-secur/https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-accused-sanders-campaign-doctored-video-social-security-cuts-2020-1The obvious intent of the video was to lie to the public about Biden's record on social security. Congratulations lol It's sad that Bernie is recycling the exact same lie he used against Hillary in 2016.>.@BernieSanders I won't cut Social Security. As always, I'll defend it, & I'll expand it. Enough false innuendos. -Hhttps://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/695764254855733248 Pretty low effort troll. > Also, it was forty years ago, so no normal person would care.Bernie, as a middle aged adult, was basically an actual commie at the height of the Cold War. This isn't some 2019 college student larping at Maoism, which is already pretty terrible. This is a full-grown adult, and a father in a time when China and the USSR were brutal authoritarian regimes that killed their own people in the millions, took a look at the brutality of the gulags, the starvation, and the repression of human rights, and decided to promote that in the United States.I really don't understand how you can deny how cataclysmic this would be for Bernie in a general election. This is genuinely the equivalent of it coming out that Trump used to be a card-carrying member of the KKK. https://www.forbes.com/sites/nadjasayej/2020/01/18/berlin-artist-jonas-jdicke-speaks-up-about-aaron-carter-art-fiasco/#120451cc2b6f > If this flimsy hit piece is the worst they've got on him, he'll be fine. Republicans have and always will try to paint any democratic nominee as "siding with the terrorists." It's what they do.Except, Bernie *actually did* ally himself with a Marxist political party that supported terrorists. >Here in Wyoming, where every other car is a pickup, and cowboy hats and boots are a working man's uniform, the 2020 election worries voters, who fear the election of a Democrat will upend their way of life, force the coal mines to close and the oil wells to stop pumping. Force them to pay higher taxes, force them to give up their AR-15 rifles and high-capacity magazines. Force them to subsidize the health care of immigrants. Force them to pay for college loans for city kids. Force. Force. Force.From these morons' lips to your ears, dear Jove.>Like his neighbors, Miller says he wishes Trump could lead the country the way he was elected to, without being second-guessed or attacked by what he considers a "corrupt" class of politicians and bureaucratsThey literally want a dictatorship.Anyways, the tldr is these people are laughably fucking stupid. Maybe it's terrible of me, but this kind of stuff is why I relish the news of every coal power plant closure and post it to /r/UpliftingNews. I always find it amusing when people whine that polls that oversample older voters should be disregarded, when older voters are the ones *who actually vote*. So it's arguable that oversampling that demographic better approximates the actual caucus than a general survey of Iowans. I post polls in this subreddit all the time, as I see them on Twitter or wherever. I get that you might not like it, but do at least try not to lie. I used to work in a service job where we had an old Russian woman like this and when we'd tell her not to scream at other patrons she'd freak the fuck out even harder. We all hated her. Maybe it's terrible of me but when she didn't show up for a while and news came out that she'd died we were all ecstatic. The lady at the end clapping and cheering as the weirdo gets arrested is really the crowning glory of this whole thing. I really don't understand why reposts get some redditors so damn bitter. Not all of us live on social media, so this is the first time some of us have seen it. >Maybe lead with that fact then?Because titles have a limited length.>Or while we’re at it, why post an outlier poll in the first place?I already answered this question. I honestly don't understand why they aren't already freaking out. Considering his demographic strengths Iowa should be one of his strongest states, and instead it's a tossup. Yeah that was my thought too. Still I like looking at all of them. Well, to be pedantic, they are progressives, not liberals. That's also not really how it works. Both of them have different bases of support: Warren does very well with college educated whites, and Bernie with non-college educated whites. Warren also competes for her demographic with Buttigieg and Biden, so if she dropped out both of them would take hefty pieces of her support. As for Bernie, Biden has been polling as a strong second choice for his voters for a while now.So if either Warren or Bernie dropped out, the other wouldn't absorb 100% of their supporters. It's entirely possible they would end up helping Biden or Pete just as much.This isn't even addressing that there's pretty much no chance of them dropping out or endorsing each other at this point. Bernie just called Warren a liar on TV, so her whole camp is likely very cold to Bernie right now. Bernie on the other hand just doesn't drop out period. I expect him to refuse to drop out and endorse until after the convention just like last time. Fortunately, it seems like his attacks on Warren might have been a bit of a straw that broke the camel's back with more of these stories coming out lately. This looks fantastic. I didn't say we didn't have *any*, I said there were *less* than where I've lived before. >That’s condescending. You've made it clear that you prefer to not believe polls in favor of a made up "voter enthusiasm", and that's okay. You are free to do whatever you feel like, but you aren't entitled to anyone's approval or respect for it.>Good talk. You made some just wonderful counter points.Why would I bother? This isn't a debate. Found the /r/fragilewhiteredditor That's nice. "pick the candidate who will do best against Trump" is actually pretty specific if you follow the polls. >However, the video of the speech makes clear Biden was actually mocking Ryan for the proposal. He leans into the microphone and says in a deep, menacing stage whisper: "Social Security and Medicare." Biden then goes on to say – in remarks not disseminated by the Sanders campaign – that the tax code needs to be reformed so enough revenue is raised to save Social Security and Medicare.>PolitiFact, an independent fact-checker, rated the Sanders newsletter as false. I can only speak to Huntsville, but unless you live in the middle of downtown, you can't really walk *anywhere*. There's plenty of places with no sidewalks, barely any public transit. That's probably part of it. That and we have less parks and destinations for stuff like skiing, hiking, etc. When I lived on the west coast there were dozens of options for amazing hikes all around me. Obviously Alabama's topography isn't anyone's fault, but the state sure doesn't exactly splurge on public lands.Then for half the year its practically too hot to do anything outside other than sit in a pool, and that will probably only get worse. In Sage Monarch the OP gets a god level cultivation art in like the second chapter and becomes almost immediately virtually all powerful. > i know all i'd need to really accept them is a few young misses crushing some dantians, or crippling some arrogant young masters. but its usually just not there. I would pledge money to a novel with a murderhobo woman so fast, just for the sheer novelty of it. I think the closest I've ever seen so far is [Phoenix Destiny](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/phoenix-destiny/) from Gravity Tales. This is seriously what I am wondering. I'd assume he would have mentioned it up front, but if this isn't a troll it is pretty much the only reasonable explanation. > My sister always talked about having one with her last pregcy that sadly ended at 14 weeks but then decided she suddenly didn't want oneBecause her last baby *fucking died* you sociopath. YTAYour behavior is just straight up nuts. None of this is normal. I don't blame your sister at all for telling you something just to shut you up. You were harassing her every fucking day for something she'd *already told you* she wasn't going to do.As for the gifts, she specifically told you gender neutral gifts only. That you chose to ignore that and get stereotypical "girly" gifts is entirely your fault.Not wanting to have the delivery of a child turn into a family spectacle is completely normal. You have exactly zero cause to be offended by that.In short, you were a complete ass for your sister's entire pregcy, and now that the consequences of your asshatery have come around to make you look like a fool, you're throwing a tantrum. Florida. Yeah, as I said, if you don't like going out to restaurants or bars, this probably won't appeal to you. The point was that some theaters *are* innovating, not that literally everyone will like it. Sure, if you don't like ever dining out and having some drinks and a meal that probably won't appeal to you. There's actually some theaters these days that have. There's one near my place that has huge power recliners for seats with side tables, and full service restaurant and bar. I saw 1917 last week and there were people having dinner and drinks delivered to them throughout the movie. November 2016. >She became "absolutely terrified " when the baby cried, while being alone w the dog.Yeah, which was *afterwards*, and after she said the *dog* was scared of the baby, not that she was scared of the dog attacking the baby.>The dog is the reason she wrote this post. There is no other reason she became terrified to go pee and have her baby let out a cry. All is nice because she came back and the dog was being cute. I have a mini beagle, never terrified it would bite a baby. She is, yet she left her baby alone.Yeah, because she probably hadn't peed all fucking day. Parenting is tough and it isn't perfect. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ I don't have kids but this is totally my cousin's daughter and their cat. She loves kitty so much but kitty just wants to be left the fuck alone. >You were terrified of the dog possibly doing something to the babyThat isn't even remotely close to what she said... Oh jeez that would explain it. I'm just curious, you realize it's really obvious that you're all brigading when all of you with no history on this subreddit suddenly show up whining about the same, off topic issue, right? Yes. Theres a lot of crossover with Renegade Immortal and this novel. Now that only makes sense if there's an argument. Nice try though. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque From my history as a service worker I was *sure* from the title it was going to involve explosive vomiting or diarrhea that you'd have to clean up. She's an incredible, brilliant woman with a lifetime of public service despite decades of bigoted conspiracy theories and concerted opposition? Well, lots of us are, so ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Well, you didn't bring up Donald Trump. You threw out a random phrase in a discussion about Bernie Sanders. Don't walk straight into those jokes then. >Rofl... I like how you say starting to, as if you somehow didn't dislike Sanders as a Biden supporter previously.Plenty of us didn't dislike Bernie automatically. I thought he was interesting when he first came into the spotlight in 2015, but he's been terrible ever since Hillary beat him.>Joe Biden can sweep the senate? Er? What is he, a janitor? This is just embarrassing to read. Why would you ever say this publicly? It just makes you seem dense.>You think all this support is going to pop up having Obama's buddy in the white house?Obama has a 95% approval rating among Dems, so this weird dismissive attitude towards him is weird.>Nothing will change except the name plates and Twitter's stock value.If someone can't tell the difference between Trump and Obama and Biden's policies, they're hopeless. /r/SandersForPresident? >Sorry, I was phrasing the question more of *when* they do work together; not ifThe if is a very big question though? Bernie has really alienated the Warren campaign in the last week.>More about the legality of it all.It's legal, just incredibly unlikely. There hasn't been a contested convention in over 50 years or so, so the idea that Warren is going to sacrifice herself politically for a man who called her a liar on national television and trashed her supporters when she could support Biden and continue having a great political career is pretty hard to believe. It's incredibly unlikely. First off Bernie just wouldn't do that sort of thing. It just isn't in his character.And given how badly Bernie has burned Warren lately, it's unlikely that she would sacrifice herself politically by making such a terrible optics move. I think people in general underestimate just how much of the party Bernie and his supporters have attacked and alienated. > over Republicans Elizabeth Warren is not a Republican. > but he's running for the democratic nomination its pretty ethically questionable to exclude him from discussion in a democratic forumNobody is excluding him.>based on a shitty technicality.A lot of us don't view it as a shitty technicality, but rather pretty significant. I could see it being a gay porn site for big white dicks. Unfortunately with Bernie's tendency to elevate sycophants, it probably won't. Bernie Sanders is an Independent Senator, not a member of the Democratic Party. This is a Democratic Party subreddit. It's not an attack to point out that considerations that apply for party unity don't really apply to him. Great! So he should have no problem joining our party formally. Lmao imagine being this disconnected from reality. 😂Giving birth, while obviously more inherently dangerous than most activities, is not so risky that every routine birth requires hospitalization. That is a *choice* that has become a cultural standard, along with routine usage of C-sections for convenience.In most births, where the mother and child are both healthy and strong and the pregcy has been normal, plenty choose to give birth at home  with perhaps the assistance of a midwife.That doesn't even begin to address the billions of women who give birth without any hospital support at all. I mean, you don't *have* to. Plenty of women deliver their babies at home. I agree. It's shocking how many Americans, in their geopolitical bubbles, are willing to ignore the realities others face, like the fact that Cuban and Venezuelan immigrants, and everyone who remembers the USSR will recoil at the possibility of electing a socialist to the presidency.Facetiousness aside, just because you consider those who disagree with you stupid doesn't actually change anything. >Also isn’t this *supposed* to be a neutral subreddit for the Dems?>for the Dems?Bernie isn't a Dem.>Or is it open season now to attack the candidates?I'm not sure how this is an attack lol. Well duh. They aren't exactly letting people try it. You can't even view the fucking store without buying the premium package which is insane. Earth's Children by Jean Auel. Book one is Clan of the Cave Bear and is actually pretty great. It goes sharply downhill about halfway into book 2. Which is a shame because the first book is actually really good. It's weird how Auel decided to take the series a completely different direction after that. First half of book 2 is okay though. This series makes me sad because the first book was absolutely fucking amazing but then Ayla meets Jondalar and it becomes just fucking. So basically you're just salty that they didn't let Bernie do his usual waffling at the debate. Okay Bed bugs are such hellspawn it would be entirely possible that Princess knew about them and just didn't succeed at exterminating them.Seriously, bedbugs are near impossible to get rid of. It often takes many thousands of dollars and multiple rounds of professional work. If you check his profile he's literally a trump supporter trolling here so probably. >Extra extra! News ragOne of the weirder parts of this cycle has definitely been the far left embracing the GOPs rhetoric on journalists and news organizations with excellent reputations for accuracy and significant journalism. Imagine calling the *Washington Post*, which has won 47 Pulitzers and brought down Nixon, a "rag" and insinuating that Bezos has to ram through editorials by major think tanks. That would make sense, my impression reading it is that they were interviewing the other travelers who saw what happened. So will I, but most Americans probably won't. I don't know about that, but he's visibly aged quite a bit just since his heart attack. >Several female travelers said more shocking than a woman stripping in the airport is the fact that of all the people who saw her, no one stepped in to help.>“I would never expect to see something like that. That would probably make me bust down and I would want to help,” said passenger Tay Credit.>“That’s the only thing that did confuse me, was no one tried to help, or cover her up; women especially.”>Another traveler said, “I would definitely want to help her.”So why didn't *they* help?... And why would we? The woman wasn't actually endangering herself or anyone else, she was just walking around naked. While really fucking weird, it's fairly safe.It didn't become dangerous until the end which is when she was arrested. This is a pretty obvious troll... Another good example is Brandon Sanderson's /r/Stormlight_Archive series, where the domit culture in the region most of the story has been set in so far discriminates based on  *eye* color."Lighteyes" are divinely appointed by God to be the ruling class of scholars, rulers, highly ranked warriors and skilled artisans, and so on."Darkeyes" are the commoners who face varying degrees of oppression and are foot soldiers, laborers, farmers and servants and slaves. At their best they could aspire to be a skilled physician or a smith. The idea of skin color discrimination is mentioned in the story as something practiced in a far away land and characters find it a ludicrous idea. Over the course of the story the reason behind eye color discrimination is explained. I haven't even ever really gotten into the Witcher, but the little I've played of the games all but beat you over the head with the message that "discriminating against those different from you is BAD!". In the first game just getting into that first city had me saving a witch from a historical mob led by some Fantasy Catholics, people hating Geralt for being a witcher with scary eyes and magic. And then I got into the city to find that the dwarves are basically apparently Fantasy Jews one step from confinement in ghettos and the elves have started a guerilla movement? It's been a long time so I don't really remember tbh.The tutorial of the third game is me training a 12 year old girl to fight with a sword with no apparent sense from any of the men in the story that she isn't just as qualified as any of them to fight monsters (once trained).I really don't understand how why Right Wing Reddit likes it so much. The whole thing story appears to be straight up social justice. >Now if only we could get you guys to stop saying “Mularky” like it’s 1959 or something.Sorry I can't hear you over the sound of my record player. Are those even really bad faith attacks? I'm a Democrat and I find all of those things pretty appalling individually. The fact that Bernie has done *all* of them are pretty indicative of immaturity and really poor judgment. I always find it kind of amusing myself when this subreddit acts like there's some kind of pagan Catechism that precisely defines the boundaries of acceptable beliefs. It's definitely not, but supporting the Castro regime, calling for cutting the military in half, and having campaigned for the Socialist Workers Party are all pretty hideously bad. > So, what might that look like? Though Trump would have an army of researchers digging into his past in courthouses and video archives, a few Google searches reveal a vast trove of controversial information that I'm confident is unknown to most Democratic primary voters. Even if none of these are themselves politically fatal, the totality would seem to offer the Trump campaign an enormous set of targets. > Interesting thought coming from a group that is trying to reconcile the right and the left. Especially given that what I see when I look into the other works of the authors and see hard criticism of progressives and zero thoughts about the right as it is.Here's just one article of theirs criticizing the right: https://www.thirdway.org/memo/fix-the-damn-bridges>I'm gonna go ahead and take that and assume that there is no good faith in writing this article. "Of course, loyal Democrats, including us..." this is literally just flat out lying. They're at least as Democratic as Bernie is, so that's just a straight up smear. Third Way has been a reputable Democratic think tank for 15 years now. Why are you lying about them? You might not like them and disagree with them, but to claim that they don't criticize Trump and the GOP and aren't solidly blue is just not true. That you have to resort to attacking the organization rather than rebutting any of the points they make about Sanders speaks volumes. $5 and $9 are ludicrously good prices for Dragon Age and Dragon's Dogma. Playing as a Sorcerer is full on ridiculous. You're squishy as you'd expect, but if your meatshields can hold off the enemy long enough for you to charge a spell, the fight is basically immediately over. You reach the point of being able to one shot bosses.It feels amazing. In modern electoral politics characteristics that expand a ticket's appeal are positive benefits. That isn't the same thing as a qualification. Everyone on that stage is "qualified" to be VP, but they don't bring the same level of benefits to a general election campaign. I'd add that it was absurd to begin with. >This is the only thing I'll say, then you can ban me from this sub:>Dolores Sandoval won 3% of the vote. Not 30, not 13, 3%.Well, yeah, that's what happens when a spoiler candidate runs. We'll never know how she would have fares in a campaign without Bernie. >Every poll out there putting the democratic candidates against Donald Trump Shows Bernie having the best chanceThis is literally a lie though. >Biden is the candidate I feel has the weakest position against Trump. He’s placid and affable. Trump supporters won’t change position for him. It’s like positioning 4 more years of that degenerate.Polling does not reflect this though.>Generally how does this sub react towards Bernie Sanders?He's not even a Democrat, and ironically after mentioning Biden, Bernie is one of the weakest against Trump. If Bernie is the nominee, Florida becomes a solidly red state for instance. I'd love any combination of Pete/Biden/Amy, but the conventional wisdom is that any one of them would have to choose a more progressive VP to expand their coalition, most likely a person of color. Kamala is the most talked about possible VP for Biden at least on Reddit, though I think Booker or Castro are also very possible. It's not a gleeful joke, it's just pointing out that it's pretty unlikely Bernie will be still be around at a particular year. That's certainly true. I suppose it depends on your point of view. It's an eww for me. Ewww. Uncle Joe stanning the goodness of America is a big reason I support him. jesus fuck here we go He's had a stutter all his life. That's actually a good point. McKinsey is a great company. Pete is so fucking hot right now. If Hillary descended through the ceiling on a combat loaded MQ-9 Reaper drone and told everyone on the stage to submit or die I'd honestly be ecstatic. Someone in the audience just laughed at Bernie lmao. Journalists have talked about this. Nobody attacks him because they are only human and nobody wants to deal with threats from his insane supporters. >tax on carbonI just came I appreciate Steyer at least not flagellating himself for daring to be a person of means like Warren, Bernie, and the rest of the succs probably want. This but unironically. Given how incompetently Trump has run his own administration Amy would have a great narrative about her strengths as a disciplined boss who will bring a no-malarkey style to the Oval Office. Hot take: America's idolization of "small town" compared to educated people from cities is bullshit and toxic to our society. But reducing education to *only* that is bad. As someone who has never lived in one of these important early primary or election battleground states I get so sick of the stories of how these morons need candidates to grovel them before they'll even deign to consider them. You should ask /r/vore. Well, there's some pretty significant differences between those, like the fact that it's still possible, even probable that Bernie will not earn a majority of delegates... I don't think Australia is quite on the list at the moment due to current events. Maybe Andorra? ...yes? Lots of public universities are very high performing and competitive institutions. If I wasn't banned I'd reply that my work in the defense industry actually produces quite a few products of significant value and watch them freak the fuck out. When you actually dig into it, Biden has been through a bunch of tragedy in his life. Well, a good point, but there are some differences like the fact that the American insurance industry employs more people than the Arby's fast food chain and doesn't destroy the environment. What is a good neoliberal solution to unaffordable childcare? malarkey level of calling insurance workers greedy while debating in Des Moines. Wait wtf Warren literally wants to nationalize pharmaceuticals? Bernie literally called the town greedy lmao He literally called the guy who asked the question greedy. John Delaney should be on that stage. I like how Bernie literally just responded to a voter question concerned about his job by actually straight up calling him greedy. Bernie: "Literally communism!" The fun thing about Rx pricing is that I have no idea if that's insane or really good. >She's been incredibly spineless this debate and I think you'll be able to look back and see that this debate is what officially did her campaign in.That's been her entire campaign though. She's never once even tried to draw a positive difference between her and Bernie. If the ceiling exploded and Hillary descended into the hall on the back of a GA MQ-9 Reaper drone with a full combat load and told everyone on that stage to submit to her or die I'd honestly be thrilled. RePuBliCAN tALkInG pOInTs Yassss throw a stapler at him Amy!!! Yassss throw a stapler at him Amy!!! wtf is Bernie babbling about? What happened to Pete? Did he die or something? Bernie takes disagreement very personally. Prediction from Warren: "Businesses are evil!!!" Baemy has the best answer on this so far. By "psychologist here", that probably means he just got admitted to the Psych major lmao. Bernie, it would be faster to just say "no"... Fuck Bernie Sanders. Bernie just had some sort of mental break on stage and it was genuinely fucking weird. He started bragging about how he hasn't had a competitive election since 1990. Bernie reminding everyone that he hasn't run in a serious election longer than millions of voters have been alive might not have been a good tact to take. Warren: > 30Sanders: => 30 That was really, really bad for Bernie. holy shit you could see Warren thought he was literally saying it on stage What the fuck is happening????????? ...Oh my god. I mean, it happens lol. Totally blanked out there. >Anyone who knows me knows that it's incomprehensibleA man goes home, and masturbates to his favorite fantasy... >Anyone who knows me knows that it's incomprehensible A man goes home, and masturbates to his favorite fantasy... Oh boyyy Yay here we go!!!! Amazon is literally suing over Microsoft being awarded the JEDI contract instead of them for this *exact reason* right now.https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/22/amazon-files-suit-protesting-microsofts-jedi-cloud-contract.htmlBernie is proposing doing almost literally the exact same thing. Why the fuck do progressives hate them anyways? I work for one and its pretty awesome. Chief of Staff Buttigieg sounds good to me. Just FYI, as anyone who works for a government contracting knows, what Bernie is suggesting about manipulating contract awards for ideological reasons rather than merit is straight up illegal. Just fyi: what Bernie is proposing is literally illegal. You can't abuse the federal contracting process in the way he describes. Great answer from Joe! Well, they worship him, which in Bernie's mind makes them important. Just look at who staffs his campaign: his sychophants. Delaney literally had this exact exchange with Warren in one of the early debates and she got super pissed. Can someone link the moderator's twitter? CNN: "Fight." Fun reminder: Bernie *is* old enough to remember; he actually is that old. Probably what, 12 or so when the bombing happened? Did Bernie just flat out admit he's beholden to special interests backing his campaign?... "We need to end trade with all outsiders and embrace Juche!" Holy shit Bernie actually getting called out. >Lets talk about tradeAnnnnddd I just orgasmed. Wtf was that weird shit from Bernie? Ohhh Uncle Joe mentioning the South Korea-Japan diplomatic disputes. I'd bring him home to meet Mom, unfortunately Chasten got to him first. :'( Okay. I don't know, I'd trust Uncle Billy Sherman. /r/Shermanposting Bernie and Warren remind me of people who would have been whining that the US shouldn't get involved in WWII. I mean, I'm not in Biden's position at 30, but I'm far better off than unemployed bum Bernie at least. To be fair, her base doesn't know any foreign policy beyond "America first". Reddit is going to freak out about Biden not thinking it a good idea to let the entire region collapse. Isn't Bernie about the right age to have been drafted? How is he not a veteran? Well, for a backwards isolationist like Bernie it probably is. Should someone tell Bernie he's describing the United Nations and NATO? "We are spending dramatically too much money on defense"Welp, crossing Steyer off my list. I should just straight up read a book when Steyer talks. Have you ever seen pictures of Biden in his 20's? He really was an actual Chad. Oh goodie here Liz goes ranting about le evil defense industry. I don't either, and hell, Iraq was a mixed bag. Sure there's a lot of shit that has gone wrong, but the Iraq War brought about at least a semi-functional parliamentary democracy and killed the Husseins. Now Iraqi sport teams can travel abroad without being fucking tortured and raped when they return home. Good answer from Biden. Oh god here we go Iraq War. Hot take: American leftists who are anti-interventionist might be the dumbest fucks ever who need to read history. I like those jokes so I hope so. I think they probably agreed to not shake hands since they were so far apart. Steyer wasn't even looking for one. They get pushed off the stage into the abyss only to arise once again as [LiberalZord.](https://powerrangers.fandom.com/wiki/Megazord) What did Biden say in his joke to Bernie? Uncle Joe!!!! > I think you have a image of incels as if they are some neckbeards and no.The image I am using is the one we are talking about that OP posted...>Neckbeards arent incels. Incels usually tried everything and still arent. For many bad skin is unresolvable, and for mant the only wy for siin problems to go is on their own. Many people also have money for proper hygiene but not expensive treatments. Incels are very often not slobs, on the contrary. They see slobs who dont care to lose weight or groom properly as voluntary celibate.Well, I'm not talking about those... Malarkey level of /r/chapotraphouse >BA: There’s a lot of economic research suggesting that it does not.>Not that I have seen.>BA: O.K.>I mean I think that’s kind of common sense. It’s called a race to the bottom.>BA: Thank you.Lol my god. Ideal situation: Biden and Buttigieg have great nights, knocking out Warren and Sanders both and the entire race turns into Pete vs Uncle Joe. The same. I saw in the news earlier that some immigration rights group is planning on protesting Joe again lol. CNN is talking about Medicare 4 All :eyeroll: Fuck that's actually really bad. I don't get it, but that's really nice. Dear fuck what did your liver ever do to you? I was baffled, and then I noticed who tweeted it, and it was even more confused. Van Jones didn't make much sense there talking about building a "movement". Bernie and Warren aren't really building "movements" either. Maybe Bernie could have done so in 2016 with all that isolationist left energy, but he's worse off in terms of support since then and he hasn't really done jack shit with it other than having AOC primary Crowley and build himself a super PAC. /r/neoliberal and /r/chadsriseup should have a baby. Holy shit, Bernie really has aged a lot since his heart attack. I actually didn't manage to watch the December debate and he's clearly lost weight since I last saw him live. Hasn't it been a while since we've heard that stupid fucking line? Oh I totally agree, but she never makes that point herself at all that I've noticed. Terry McAuliffe on CNN making the point that people should be sick of progressives like Bernie harping about the Iraq War vote from almost 18 years ago. 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 Oh lol I just realized I did timezones wrong and the debate isn't about to start. Probably obvious, but Booker is running for reelection to his Senate seat now. Just got a fundraising email. Good ad from Biden. He makes the great point that he is the one polling best against Trump, while Bernie and Warren are in some battleground underwater by double digits. I mean, at this point I would really settle for her articulating *any* reason why Americans should support her for President over Bernie Sanders. CNN is reporting that Warren is apparently working hard to avoid a fight in the debate lol.Fuck it's honestly just sad how beholden she acts to Bernie. Why is she even in the race? She constantly defers to him, and it's frustrating. /r/neoliberalgaming also exists. Bara is better anyways. I suddenly want to watch a Star Wars fan film with Joe as Dark Lord of the Sith and Pete his neoliberal apprentice. I honestly hope so, I don't like Warren much at all but it's been so embarrassing watching how grovelling she's been towards Bernie all campaign. I miss all the liberals who've dropped out or are polling super low. :( This makes me like Biden more. > but the whole Greta phenomenon feels manufactured as fuck.It is, but at the same time I think she's still pretty cool. I literally had this discussion on /r/democrats last night. It was so fucking stupid. Bernie doesn't support a carbon tax and apparently that's fucking great because his "climate justice" will mean oil executives get guillotined and their estates seized or whatever and that will somehow magically shutdown coal power plants. I think it really does depend on who gets nominated. Probably still leans GOP even after how hard Trump screwed the state over. One of the petty things that annoys me is that these stories have female sect leaders who are built up as being super powerful and then they turn out to basically be shy and somewhat naive 15 year olds.Someday I want a novel where a character tries crap like this on the Icy Woman Sect Leader(TM) and she blows his head off. Bad skin is hardly an unresolvable problem. /r/skincareaddiction is a really nice sub that has a great track record of helping people clear up.Sure, there are some people with more serious, chronic skin conditions but that probably doesn't apply to most slobs like the one above who can't even be bothered to clean up his facial hair. The guy in the bottom isn't that radically different. The difference is guy on the bottom does basic hygiene and grooming and has a different facial expression. The random cigarette is unattractive in both.I really don't get the point. If anything the message this is conveying is that you'll have a better time with women if you aren't a complete fucking slob. >The others are not even acknowledging climate justice.Because as satisfying and cathartic as fucking over a bunch of oil executives might be, it doesn't actually do jack shit to phase out coal fired power generation. >t's not an option on the table because Sanders has not yet been elected.We're electing a President, not a fucking dictator! Bernie under the wildest circumstances won't have the power to bring about socialism or nationalize the utilities.>A carbon tax keeps the pumps running for too long. Climate change is not something that can be negotiated away at the last minute like a government shutdown or something.Then maybe you ought to wake up and realize that, insufficient as it may be, a carbon tax is the fastest mechanism we have for driving change in the power market. The fact of the matter is that Bernie clearly doesn't see this as all that urgent, since he doesn't want to take even the moderate action of carbon taxes against climate change. I believe the implication is there's a good chance she's going to go fucking scorched Earth on Warren lol. Well, tough shit, because that's not really an option on the table. Fighting climate change is far more important than whining about who is paying for it, and in a relatively free market capitalist society imposing a tax on the end users of energy is the most effective way to change the supply over to a cleaner sources. I get that that doesn't seem "fair", but that's just how real life is. And yet Bernie opposes a carbon tax, [which pretty much every economist of the last half-century](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/01/17/this-is-not-controversial-bipartisan-group-economists-calls-carbon-tax/) has called essential to that shift in energy. > Millions of people are dead because of climate change denial And millions more will die if the United States doesn't implement reasonable, evidence driven policies to fight climate change. Why doesn't Bernie support that? > "That's bullshit" is not a valid debate point.Neither is breaking the rules to accuse everyone who disagrees with you of being a shill.>Sounds like your scared of climate justice.I'm not scared of it, it's just stupid and won't accomplish anything, not to mention being probably illegal to begin with.>GoodSee, this really just reinforces the perception that you and Bernie don't care about climate change as much as you do dunking on people you don't like. I don't know, this, mixed with Bernie's lack of support for carbon taxes just makes it seem like you and he are more interested in the political showmanship of destroying an unpopular group of companies and executives rather than implementing data based policies to fight climate change. > Everything your saying is exactly what groups like the Heartland Institute pays $8 per post for.Well, that's pretty cool, but I think pointing out how completely nonsensical this "climate justice" stuff of Bernie's is hardly worth $8. But it's cute that you can't handle the barest criticism without lashing out with personal attacks. > Right. Because with climate justice, a carbon tax would not be necessaryThat's bullshit.>The fossil fuel industry funded psuedo-science that says climate change is a hoax. They deserve drained bank accounts to pay for the switch to alts.This is a non sequitur, and not really legally possible or economically sound.>And it's the fossil fuel industry that wants more nuclear power. Because one mistake brings us back to fossil fuels.You really think the fossil fuel industry is such strong supporters of public nuclear, that we have zero new plants under construction, all in some sort of elaborate scheme to send us flying back to their product which *nuclear replaced in the first place*, in the very unlikely case of a catastrophic accident? I must say, that's impressively convoluted. Exactly. Ironically, Bernie screwed over his own state in the exact same way. https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelshellenberger/2019/04/16/bernie-sanders-denies-closure-of-vermont-nuclear-plant-increased-emissions-the-data-says-otherwise/#6e57399d43d9I mean, people here should like him all they want, but his environmental record is not one his strong points to be leading with lol. He's also one of only three who support the TPP, which is a shame. I wish Klobuchar was better on trade. >Bernie leads the pack on climate justice. Except for him being only one of two candidates [to not consider a tax on carbon emissions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/climate-change/carbon-tax/) and wanting to phase out our nuclear power capacity, sure lol. Biden, Bloomberg, and Klobuchar. :)Have to say I'm pretty disappointed in the lack of support for nuclear power among candidates. I hate you lol. Putin knows he has to stop Biden for the same reason he had to stop Hillary: His imperial ambitions can't risk an intelligent, patriotic liberal as President again. No. Actually, Anakin had already been accepted into the Sith Order at that point as Darth Vader. I honestly can't tell if this is a dumber conservative grandma, or liberal grandma and the problem to be solved is the rednecks... Leftists aren't really known for their familiarity with history. One of the reasons the US jumped in when we did in invading North Africa is because Stalin was desperate. It's also entirely possible the Allies would have collapsed years before without the enormous materiel aid of [Lend Lease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lend-Lease#US_deliveries_to_the_Soviet_Union). My favorite exchange on this subject was some Bernie Bro ranting about the evils of le evil imperialism. I think it was back during the whole freakout about Hillary tweeting indirectly about Tulsi. Anyways, it culminated with them demanding a single example of "American regime change" being positive. They answered with: "Germany", and I think the bro never replied. Should have screenshotted it. This is the kind of vibe I got reading the first several chapters of Child of Light lmao Any readers want to chime in on how good this is? > It really is anyone's electionIn Iowa, maybe. In the rest of the country, the story is significantly different. Honestly, I'd hope so, but in the past when Warren has been put on the spot about even a potential conflict with Bernie she's been pretty deferential to him, so I personally expect that will be what she does again. It blows my mind that they are so delusional that they think voters will see this as a *good* thing. Propaganda isn't really the right word here. Bernie has been running a very negative campaign for months now. It's about time the media and voters started talking about it. Is the top left Eton students? Because ironically Eton had worked *really* hard to stop being seen as a upper crust institution and become meritocratic, and offers significant ficial aid.So really, in a lot of ways, Eton is the exact opposite of what they want to convey here lmao. Eton is still a huge sacrifice for families to send their sons to even with ficial aid but those students tend to be famously hard working because they know that the education, extracurriculars, and social connections they can forge are the chance of a lifetime that their families are sacrificing to give them.There was a big article about it a year or two back, in the Guardian or Economist? I mean, some of them, insanely enough, actually are. Me too. Personally I think he should have articulated a pro-business message. He was never going to win over progressives after daring oppose their Lord that one time, so he might have well run on an American jobs and trade thing. Yeah the video went briefly viral early 2019, but the media was afraid to talk about it. It can be sure, but I think she'd be more compelling on this narrative if she'd done more to embrace the center left and Obama's legacy. Obama did make the government a force for good in a lot of ways but Biden seems to have mostly captured that in this primary. I mean, it would help if he shaved and washed his face and didn't fucking smoke cigarettes around strangers.One of the big differences between the top/bottom and the middle is that the former looks like he doesn't take care of himself at all, with dirty(?) skin and scraggly facial hair like a child.These are appearance things but yeah I don't know why someone who can't even do basic hygiene would expect a great reception.The smoking in public doesn't help. While plenty of people don't care, that's never considered a positive, and is a negative for a lot of people. As I said, he sounds like a seriously unstable and vindictive psychopath. What you're describing isn't a loving relationship, you're describing abuse. You realize this hot take contradicts your own religion which records numerous mythological marriages in the Old Testament, right? You do realize this just makes your God sound like a violent, unhinged psychopath who none of us would ever want to associate with, right? The Gospel narrative invents Herod's massacre of the Innocents to establish a literary link between Jesus and Moses. We have contemporary accounts of Herod the Great's reign, so we know he never killed random children. Also, there was no Empire wide census during that period. There was a census conducted in the Roman province of Syria under the governor, Quirinius, but that was *after* Herod died, and it did not require people to travel back to the town of their birth to participate. >They don't get to redefine the institution that God establishedGod didn't establish marriage. Bernie really is awful >How does this affect him? What authority does he lose after they voted for impeachment? Why weren't his powers temporarily removed until the trial? >I get the label, but it doesn't sound like much of a consequence.It's a consequence only because Trump is a narcissistic baby who will be furious about being embarrassed. Actually in a lot of districts it's policy that teachers teachers can't lay hands on students in virtually any circumstances. Maybe she should be trying to talk them down, but teachers are just human and she's probably out of fucks to give by the time things escalated to this point. Wow, that's some real tin foil hat stuff there. I don't think these morons understand how human reproduction works. Hint: even with artificial wombs, a sexbot can't get pregt. Is it ever explained what Ayala Secura doesn't wear Jedi robes? What a gud boi Not to mention no frat is going to kick a brother out just for being awkward around women without helping them improve. The only way this reaction would make sense would be if he was doing something borderline criminal. Because we all know that Biden and Trump are politically pretty close to polar opposites, and you pretending that black people are just irrationally self-hating even when there's a lengthy article in which multiple black Americans explain their reasoning for supporting Biden is pretty fucked up. >They like they’re jailer.Ewww blatant racism. > im getting tired of hearing about people like you being "put off" by Bernie or me. Well, perhaps you should act more civilly, then.>He is the only real lefty here I'm a liberal, not a leftist, so I don't find that particularly compelling.>and you might want to switch parties to the R. There is no "center" anymore and you need to pick sidesOkay, the side I choose is liberalism and capitalism. > You are the reason why we have trump nowYou know, this behavior is a big part of the reason so many people are put off of Bernie and his progressive agenda. It *should* be all about policy, but the reality of the matter is that this kind of toxic behavior inevitably taints Bernie's campaign, even if he didn't tacitly encourage it. > I personally know republicans who would vote for Bernie I'm sure you do. 🙄 > When this poll was included, Biden's chances of winning the nomination went from 38% to 39% and Bernie's went from 24% to 23% according to the 538 projection. Good. And also vacationing in the USSR and being video taped singing, shirtless and drunk. Most people wouldn't consider that a lie... Lol yeah and I have a $10 coupon that doesn't expire until May so I'll probably buy something else. > I don’t see why Bernie would cause us to lose any of those things. He’s a pretty popular politicianYou really think a self-declared socialist is going to be all that popular with purple and red state voters?... > Do you seriously think that in purple states it is better to pander to Republicans that will never vote for you anyway, or just maybe appeal to not voters and increase turnoutAre you one of those people who are under the delusion that there's a secret, untapped band of millions of socialist voters in red and purple states? No, I don't think it's better to appeal to voters who *don't exist*. > Just because biden is up by 6 points in a nevada poll ( where bernie outperformed significantly in 2016) doesnt mean bernie is not going to win. I didn't say Bernie had *no* chance to win, I pointed out that you lied about the recent polls. Because,>Not everyone lives in deep blue states. If her staff tells her that voting for those judges is a better strategic move for her in Minnesota than not voting for those judges, than she should. Not everyone lives in deep blue states. I love Pete, but it really is time for him and several others to drop out. Stopping Bernie needs to be the most important thing. Ah, another Steam user, I see. Thanks! I'll do that. But as we've seen in past primaries, voters don't especially care about that. [crickets]Anyways, I assume he's referring to some kind of socialist revolution to overthrow capitalism and liberal democracy. That's insane, but I'm not sure what the hell else it could be referring to. Russia is boosting Sanders again, I'd assume. That's fine, I imagine there's plenty of blue states that will be thrilled to settle some ambitious and hard-working immigrants and reap the economic benefits. Well, at least he managed to claw to the top of the polls finally in what should be one of his strongest states. Well... Yeah. Bernie and his supporters haven't done a very good job of convincing people. That's the whole point. Texas' most recent poll was in December, and Nevada's was a few days ago. In Texas, Biden is up by 20 points and in Nevada, one of the states which was said to be one of Sander's stronger ones, Biden is up 6. What do you even get out of lying about the polls? We can all see for ourselves that Bernie isn't close at all and they are significantly more recent than what you say. Well, that's what happens when you blow up the free trade that is a major supporter of the modern American economy. I agree, but I hope Pete gets some kind of role in the administration to build his resume further. I could see him winning the nomination in a couple cycles if he keeps building his political career in the executive branch or maybe the Senate. Well, some of the stuff Paltrow supports can seriously hurt people, so it is demonstrably worse. This actually really puts me off trying Celebrity. Oh I hadn't even remembered that part. But really though one thing I wish the sequels had done more is delve into the fact that Padme had her own issues too. Are there really that many of them making 80k? I got the impression that a lot of them support Bernie because they're lazy and irresponsible and just want the free healthcare and college without working for it. Weirdly I've never encountered this... Usually it seems to be people forgetting that red mages (and summoners) have raises at all. If I had a nickle for every time I was down along with half a raid on those jobs and the healer decides to raise some other DPS that can't help them bring people back... :( The FFXIV soundtracks are always very worth it as purchases. The only one I'm missing at this point is Before Meteor. And in Shadowbringers, he's the Minstreling(sp?) Wanderer. >WageslaveI think it's interesting how many incels think having a job and disposable income is literally a bad thing.I mean, yeah, surprise! It's easier to have sex with people if you have your own reasonably furnished home. /r/dolphinconspiracy won't like this. All the prequels had official novelizations back when they came out, not sure what their status is under Disney. Ok. I didn't say that lmao I just remembered reading this one point in the book as a kid that specifically addresses this one meme Yeah that part doesn't really make sense. Luke could have learned it and taught his students I suppose which explains Rey (who'd learn it via Leia) and Ben knowing it. Or just natural affinity for it? The novelization of Revenge of the Sith actually addresses this. One of the reasons Anakin was so happy about joining the council is that by doing so he'd be able to freely access the holocrons in the archives with information about Force Healing, which was a more obscure and high level ability.That is why he freaked out when Mace told him he wouldn't become a Master. He didn't really care about the title so much, but it was necessary to his plan to try to save Padme.Of course, he could have just fucking asked Obi Wan to check out the holocrons for him but Anakin was never very smart and he was obsessed with keeping the marriage a secret. Oh yeah I know about Ruby Carbuncle. I Just want more. This is depressingly real. Much of the world doesn't take Trump's sanctions very seriously iirc. They would have had to recast similar looking actors and sure it wouldn't have been the same, but it would be feasible. It would have worked better as an R rated HBO series in the vein of GoT and would have needed some judicious editing to make Jacen less of an obnoxious brat whose just taken Intro to Philosophy his freshman year, but yeah it would have been awesome.The Red Wedding moment during the attack on the worldship arc would have been amazing. Imagining people freaking out at Jacen going dark at the end of the first movie and it would have been awesome. :( I was bad off at 26 too, and lived at home, but at least I had a fucking job, even if it wasn't glamorous, and was actively working to improve my situation.This guy wants to go to graduate school but doesn't even know what academic discipline to apply in??? Wtf? This whole thing seriously reads like an Onion article. AOC is so childish, I just feel bad for her constituents. Hopefully they correct their mistake. I don't know, can you do /u/worldgoes the courtesy of disagreeing with him without insinuating he's being paid to do so? >I've never met anyone who's as die-hard for Biden as your history shows you to be as though he's actually a great candidate better than all the others and not just the best in that he can win. I wonder if Reddit is ever going to get over it's stunned disbelief that Joe Biden is overwhelmingly popular outside the far left social media bubble. This isn't really a *minor* change, but I'd have more of the Summoner's skills execute *through* their egi, and be more like FFXI Summoners.If that's too much, I'll take Egi glamours. They don't have to give it to us for free. Hell, just have the SMN story of the next expansion (assuming they don't just do roles again) be going back through Austerities of Lightning, Water, and Ice to be able to change things up. I hope that fact checker is ready to have their life destroyed by Bri-Bri. Certainly explains why Bernie and Warren are so far underwater in Florida. It's unfortunate, but a lot of Reddit is really in denial about Biden's chances at this point. It's like 2016 all over again in a lot of ways. > I'm going to get plastered every night.This is also my cruise plan lol. > Just got off the Carnival Dream. There are no plastic straws anywhere!!!!!!!☹️Wonderful news. I love that you linked this subreddit here. How is this drama? It's just pointing out that Biden has a great campaign strategy that is working out very well for him. I absolutely plan on screwing Bernie by voting against him in the 2020 primary, yes, same way most of us screwed him over in 2016. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Not really.

You can read ongoing novels for free, but there are monetization strategies in place on completed novels to ensure that the rights holders and translators are paid for their work.While the original post is great and names a lot of great works, don't be scared to jump into translated works! It can be hard to follow the prose and story sometimes, at first, but you catch on pretty quick. Frogs in the well, not knowing how vast the heavens are. > Both novels are 10000 pages(not an exaggeration) of a guy who never fails, complete wish fulfillmentI've only read one thing from IET, but in that one the main character fucks up so catastrophically that he spends most of the novel trying to recover from the consequences of that mistake. If you think Er Gen's protagonists are people who "never fail" and are complete wish fulfillment, I'd submit you haven't read very far into his works, except maybe A World Worth Protecting, which is definitely on the lighter side *so far*.Yeah, there *are* novels which are very much like that, but those two authors don't write them lol.>I could read multiple western series insteadYou could level similar complaints about pretty much any genre. I could complain about Western fantasy because "the good guys always win" and it is a waste of time to read because I could just read non-fiction instead. That is a similarly incorrect criticism. But if you just don't like themes common in the subgenre, that doesn't mean it's *bad*, it just means you have different preferences. > such as novels by Er Gen Seriously, [Renegade Immortal](https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/renegade-immortal) just ended too and it was amazing! There's plenty of great stuff by English authors out there for sure, but not delving into the stuff translated from Chinese is really denying yourself. > I will say that not all xianxia gets as 'big' as you mentioned, but there certainly are stories like thatDAE [Desolate Era](https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/desolate-era)? > the next a planet, etc...One of my favorite scenes in one novel is a main character barely managing to survive the onslaught of a very powerful elder after his treasures. After he escapes, and heals, he has an epic scene where he literally flies as a giant through space and bombards the elder's home planet into dust. In Paolini's Inheritance series, the dwarves exist but the insulting goes the other way around. In xianxia: "you're courting death!" I haven't read the whole thing myself, but I've heard Jean Auel's *Earth's Children* series is an example of this. The first book, *The Clan of the Cave Bear*, is absolutely amazing. The sequel, *The Valley of the Horses* isn't as good, but I still enjoyed it for the most part despite some more eye-roll bits.But from what I've heard the series goes sharply downhill from there into basically pure romance with lots and lots of over the top sex scenes and the protagonist becomes rather Mary Sue'ish.Which maybe it isn't *bad* for what it is, but I've heard a lot of readers were put off by the seeming shift from interesting Paleolithic fiction to pretty explicit romance. If you're looking for something to read, please keep Tarr in mind! It looks like she might be self-publishing a lot of her works now, and they are very reasonably priced. I remember reading her Avaryan series and really enjoying it. I actually found an omnibus of *Avaryan Rising* at a used bookshop last year and need to re-read it. I've also seen *Alamut* recommended here in the past. I just got *The Isle of Glass*, which sounds awesome and has great reviews. >1. Bernie is not involved with Our Revolution at all anymore.Do you honestly think anyone here is that gullible?>1. The amount of money raised in 3 years is less than 1% of what Sanders has raised since he started his 2020 campaign. No argument can possibly be made that this will influence Sanders' decisions.The issue isn't the money itself, it's that Sanders is a hypocrite. Oh, I guess I should have screenshotted the bio. This user also calls herself a socialist. Nobody is saying it's a threat, but it deserves to be pointed out how hypocritical Sanders is. I've seen a few of them unironically say that. Also see my post in /r/EnoughCommieSpam for where she declared that American soldiers deserve death. >How many failed presidential campaigns did Trump attempt before wooing rural America with blatant racism? You make a good point. Maybe in 2024, if Bernie is still alive, he'll find a better reception.>People weren’t tired of him. And Sanders is out-polling Trump in some key states atmAnd in some, like Florida, he is underwater by double digits. Sanders does outpoll Trump in some states because, surprise! Trump is a historically unpopular president. All the candidates do to some extent, but Bernie is one of the worst in head to head matchups vs Trump.At some point you guys are going to have to confront the reality that Americans really aren't that enamored of Bernie's socialism-lite shtick. Y'all have been claiming the Revolution is just around the corner for *years* now, but the midterms went poorly for Berniecrat candidates compared to moderates, and Bernie is significantly worse off than where he was in 2016. It's delightful seeing Sanders *finally* take some vetting this time around. I'm honestly confused how the hell they convince themselves that Bernie is leading in the polls. The best he is managing to do is tie Biden in Iowa, which should be one of his strongest states, which is incredibly *bad* news for him. > Buttigeig is giving Joe Biden a run for his money tooI love Buttigieg, but no he's not. > Meanwhile everyone is acting like Bernie isn’t even running Bernie has been running for President nonstop for 5 years now. People are tired of it. > And at at certain point they had to stop ignoring him when he is leading in most polls).Bernie has never been leading in the polls, *ever*.https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html >The South will rise again.Sherman really should have stomped harder lmao Good. It's a shitty song anyways. America is great at all, but I can't stand that song. Having sex with a virgin is really *not* that thrilling of an experience. It's weird that people idolize it that much. Kind of [Reverend Insanity](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/reverend-insanity/). The MC's cheat device lets him self-detonate for a chance to travel back in time and try again. There's big drawbacks to doing so, unlike in other novels.The author, Gu Zhen Ren, has also apparently said that he would let the MC die for real if at some point it would serve to make the novel more interesting. Amy is way too protectionist on trade for my liking, but she's still by far one of the better candidates. It looks like GOG doesn't have the soundtrack and artbook though. I don't care much about the artbook but having a download of the soundtrack can be nice. When Bernie donates a few million dollars so they can afford to implement them, I'd guess. Maybe he can sell one of his three homes. This but unironically. "I know nothing about the military beyond action movies!" This. On Veterans Day there was a video of a WWII vet screaming at protestors that he wanted to kill them all on /r/Publicfreakout for disrespecting Trump. It was awful. They kept trying to reason with him and he just kept screaming that they should all be shot.It's unfortunate, but having served in WWII doesn't make you a good person.Found it: https://www.newsweek.com/wwii-veteran-trump-protesters-new-york-veterans-day-parade-1471111 It does, but attacking the people who made something out of an abandoned school building is stupid. Twitter is stupid and thinks Huntsville shut down a school in order to make a brewery. In reality, the school had been closed for low enrollment and poor performance years before and the building sat empty for years before it was repurposed, so everyone in the comments just looks really stupid. No. Just go on the Christian subs sometime. The excuses they come up with are batshit. >This subreddit is about Huntsville, AL, not dog rescues.So nobody cares about your bizarre crusade against pitbulls. Cool. I found it at the Kroger on University back before the holiday break. They had those 6packs of half size cans.It was surprisingly okay. I live for this salt. Shoot it straight into my veins honestly. >"The gym has been turned into a brewery" is a sentence that almost made me cry. We live in an unimaginably cruel world that does not value the children that fall through the cracks at all.

Trump had about a 30% chance, which was obviously the outcome. What does this have to do with primary polls? I genuinely question how people this fucking stupid survive. They did. That's how polls work. They tally up all the responses they got, and now they're reporting that Biden has a double-digit lead. >I might not have thought so if he hadn’t “predicted” Obama would do this exact same thing/r/TrumpCriticizesTrump is always a wild ride if you like that kind of stuff. Really? I remember doing that and they just say they'll stick around until you change your mind, and the quest never gets resolved and you still can't kill them. My Lord, is that legal? >Being in the military is enough to be disrespected. It is an atrocious organization responsible for death and destruction on a biblical scale. They are an international force for terror and exploitation.Eww what a moron The blades are easily the worst part of the vanilla game. There should absolutely have been an option to side with the Greybeards and Parth over the blades. Their whole thing just doesn't make any sense. Not to mention that the work they do isn't pure evil. One of the particularly dumb leftists I went to college with is on Twitter liking tweets about how we shouldn't feel bad about Iran killing American troops. It's worth remembering that this was the mindset of quite a few in 2016, and it hasn't worked out well for them at all. >Wtf? He's a pig but you're suggesting ruining some ~~young kids~~ adult's life.Ftfy. I wonder if after resurrecting Li Muwan still only has early Nascent Soul cultivation. /r/velvethippos >But to say that a war with Iran would be the fault of everyone that voted for him (1) absolves the Trump administration of responsibilityMultiple parties can be at fault for a situation simultaneously. >Could what you're saying also be framed as, "The people in the center who refuse to join the far left in order to take a candidate everyone can be ok with?"No? This would only be valid if Bernie had won the primary in 2016 and the center left refused to vote for him.>Right now I repeatedly see people say that people are going to "have to vote for Biden."If Biden is the nominee, you absolutely must vote for him.>There will be a lot of people on the far left who won't. And *they* are the evil people who are responsible for shit like a possible war with Iran. >And you'll probably come back with a snotty, "Well, let them see how they like 4 more years of Trump!"Jesus fucking Christ, that's literally what I'm criticising: the far left who refuses to stand up to Trump because Hillary and now Biden/Buttigieg/Warren aren't pure enough. >So do you really think anyone who voted Bernie/stein —> trump hangs out on a subreddit dedicated to the Democrats?First off, this isn't aimed at just Bernie -> Trump, but also Stein voters, Johnson voters, nonvoters, and people who wrote in Bernie or Harambee or whatever. And they, and their apologists, pop up fairly regularly, so yeah. >Are you intentionally trying to divide the party now?No.>Like I’ll tell you right now I wasn’t inspired in the least by Hillary but I did my duty and voted for her.If you voted for Hillary, you obviously aren't the problem under discussion here. Soleimani is a big figure in Iran. The Iranian moderates aren't going to be able to smooth this over, there's already enormous demonstrations in Iran demanding blood so there's going to be some kind of violent response. /uj if it actually happens it really might, depending on how many developers are between 18 and 25. I doubt developing Elder Scrolls VI is going to be considered an occupation essential to the war effort. Joe's steady, tested leadership is a big reason why I support him. They tend to not be all that bright, so probably. Yes, you aren't going to fix the future when you fuck up in the exact same way *again* because some people are too narcissistic and privileged to admit they got completely duped and fucked up. Far left subreddits have frequently referred to Pete as "Buttplug". The far left also repeatedly claims that he isn't "gay enough". This is exactly the kind of situation for why I support Joe. We need calm, experienced leadership. We need a return to the steady internationalism of the Obama administration. Now is not the time to abandon international accords and relationships and "bern down" the status quo. I want things to be returned to how they were under Obama and improve from there. No. Because the core of the problem is that those people are gullible enough to swallow all the bullshit the right fed them about Hillary, they'll be gullible enough to believe it about *any* Democratic candidate.Part of any recovery from Trump's presidency is necessarily going to have to involve them admitting how utterly fucking wrong they were about Hillary Clinton. All the people who just weren't "inspired" in 2016. There's several in the comments here making excuses. Well, he's leaving stuff open because like in all his novels there's a connection to the larger narrative. It seems like Wang Lin is going to be fairly significant in A World Worth Protecting, for example. >Well plenty of us have been in that situation so it’s nothing newNah, I would guess most of us stop reading novels we think aren't that good well before the 2k chapters mark.>stop trying to gatekeep the comment section and get over it.Get over what? >If I described this as the best novel ever I’d bet you would instantly believe that I read it, you wouldn’t have even commented to me in the first place,It would certainly be more plausible than you reading over two thousand chapters of a novel you consider mediocre. Honestly I like this more than a lot on here. It looks like a place someone actually lives. It really baffles me why anyone at this point gives him their loyalty when he shows constantly that he can't be trusted with it. It really blows my mind just how much the people who yelled about Hillary being a warhawk are willing to ignore from Trump in how hard he's fucked the rest of the world to avoid admitting they were really fucking gullible in 2016. >I've been cautiously optimistic about Trump not being too much of a hawkHe's literally been a huge hawk since the moment he took office... You're a troll not because you have a different opinion but we can all see you have no history on this subreddit, much less this novel before jumping in on the last several chapters with inflammatory comments. You describe this novel as overhyped and barely okay and you expect us to believe you read the entire thing? You aren't a very good troll. > Apparently the ending explains why he could rescurrect her with the compass/gas at the end of RI.Hot guess: it has something to do with the Abyss Builders and their Art of Possession. It's only officially available through Qidian, webnovel.com Same here. I think part of it is there's things you'll miss if you haven't read Pursuit of Truth. The biggest example is of course All-Seer/Compass spirit turning into a black crane (like Grandpa Crane/Kong Mo) and referencing the True Morning Dao World. Time to catch up. > I really feel like the reincarnation thing was half assed kinda out of nowhere.There actually has been a lot of foreshadowing, but a lot of it has been so long ago that it can be hard to remember. The Seven-Colored Realm, for example, and the stuff with the Ji Qiong, and the Heaven Defying Bead. The first book of Coiling Dragon came out on Audible.

Soleimani is a huge figure in Iran. If this is true, it's huge, and could very possibly push the entire region into all-out war.So Trump might have completely fucked US interests in the Middle East, but good job everyone who peddles the "Hillary is a war hawk who will start WWIII" bullshit, you definitely didn't fuck us all over. This does not look like a very appealing time. Looks like a senior night. I would want to be too in that situation tbh. I like how most of the chairs arent being used.I think I'm going to get comfortable just tossing those towels aside and taking a chair. That, and I think the senior year thing is Biden joking that Bernie should be retiring after he loses. What I'm getting from this is he's saying this is Bernie's last year of being relevant in politics. Go uncle Joe! > I am hopeless in pursuing any positions in Silicon Valley or Southern CaliforniaStop only applying to positions only in a very small geographic area. >  We always try to get 4123 on the Pride when we can.brb searching for cruises on Pride. >But throughout the cruise, each time Macmot peered out at her terrible view, she was reminded of what she now knew: Booking a Guarantee Oceanview category doesn’t mean a guaranteed unobstructed oceanview cabin.How much time was this chick spending in her cabin???

I upgraded from an interior to an interior with portholes because it was only another couple bucks a day. Having some daylight to help me get up in the mornings is worth it to me, but I'm expecting to spend almost no time there outside of sleeping and showering.And just looking at the two pictures, one is angled towards the lifeboat so it looks really bad, but the second one which is more straight on looks okay.

The general consensus here is that formal night is going by the wayside and rightfully so. It's too annoying to pack a suit and worry about dressing up on vacation.

Okay, I'll add a bit to summarize the main point then. When they first launched close to a year ago Reddit threw a tantrum about them offering generous terms to developers in exchange for timed exclusivity and free games to players to help them get market share to compete with Steam. Every free game thread for Epic on this subreddit was an dramatic popcorn fest for a while.Really it all boils down to Reddit being angry that someone is trying to compete with Steam. /r/PoliceBrotality. "surely what we need to cross the 10 point gap between Bernie and Biden is to shit all over veterans trying to find jobs!" Don't forget "Republican talking points". Nah, I just refuse the ridiculous conspiracy theory about oligarchs. Wang Lin using Flowing Time with half-Heaven Trampling cultivation to send Slaughter into the past is such a plot twist I almost want this to become an M. Night Shyamalan movie.Also reminder that the Boundary Compass he is talking about is apparently a treasure made by Su Ming. It's where the Heaven Defying Bead originated. Wang Lin gaining it, and a lot of his other weird fortunate coincidences and other unexplained stuff would have been arranged by Slaughter. Soft money is a good thing though.

Ah yes, like Our Revolution. You misunderstand me. I think Sanders and Warren's plans are fucking stupid *in addition to* being impossible to pass. It's not like I'm settling with Buttigieg, Klobuchar, or Biden.Besides you seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding of how negotiating works. Bargaining, like how you suggest where both sides meet in the middle, only works where both sides would suffer a loss by not coming to an agreement, like haggling over goods at a market.But in Congress, Republicans lose nothing by rejecting Sanders and Warren's far left plans. You can't force them to take it up. > Also sketchy background in military intelligence and international consulting screams CIA spook.Oh wow are people really still peddling that stupid conspiracy theory?Newsflash: Outside of twitter and Reddit, most people don't think being a military veteran is a *bad* thing. 😂This makes us like him *more*, not less. > Tell you what, save yourself the trouble.

He's 10 points behind the frontrunner and on track to receive barely any delegates on Super Tuesday.>Whoever is the more popular candidate will win. End of story.That's the entire fucking point! The most popular candidate **isn't** Bernie Sanders. Honestly after Bernie loses this time, I think the Democratic Party should make a rule barring those who don't *commit* to becoming party members long term from running. People, like Bernie, who break their word should be barred from future contests.It's unfortunate he was just reelected in Vermont. They deserve better representation in the Senate. > Criticisms are attacks? Bernie's refusal to drop out for months after Hillary beat him and his years of attacking the "Democratic establishment" and the press are both terrible. > My comment standsSure, whatever, just be aware that it comes across as completely irrational. > That's a weird to thing to say because if anything Bernie has expanded the number of people participating in the primaries AND has the lowest floor of anyone runningBernie has lost a significant percentage of his support since 2016.>He's hardly budged at all from 15-20% meanwhile Biden continues to drop Biden has been steady in the high twenties except for a surge immediately following his campaign launch.  https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.htmlHe isn't dropping.

Appealing to the most fickle voters in the electorate is a fools errand. >You don’t expect the youth to vote Biden,The youth don't tend to vote at all, which is why most candidates aren't treating them as a significant factor.

What else do you want from them, exactly?>As far as Afghanistan, we broke a country, destabilized a region, and gotten tens of thousands of Americans and allies killed, as well as hundreds of thousands of Afghanis killed for what?We got rid of the Taliban. Afghanistan is far better off than it was 20 years ago. They have a democratically elected government, people have rights and can pursue an education, the government doesn't blown up antiquities, they don't support terrorism, and they interact with the rest of the global community. Do you think so? You started talking about the war in Afghanistan. Now you're talking about an awfully vague "20 years of drone striking brown people". What exactly are you trying to criticize Sweden for?But I generally support drones as a useful technology to keep our troops out of harm's way, sure. That's a good thing, though. Unless you are seriously arguing that liberating Afghanistan from a despotic theocracy that killed thousands of people on 9/11 alone was a bad thing. Ah yes, that imperialist powerhouse, Sweden. /s The picture in the post has literally nothing to do with bombing brown people. 😂Not that bombing people is always a bad thing.Here's a cool video of the US bombing the fuck out of an ISIS held island! https://youtu.be/k765WyzGyXU > I don’t care about LGBT. Mmm of course not.>As the post says, you scum simply want more gay people bombing random brown people for not worshipping you. It says nothing like that at all. You're delusional.>Fuck off.I participate here regularly, so no, I'm not going anywhere. Why don't you crawl back into whatever homophobic subreddit you came from? Lmao why? Sorry that Western society has mostly moved beyond conservative Christian hate for LGBT people. Sweden's defense is generally considered pretty robust. What the hell are you talking about? I'd love to see your source for Sweden committing a genocide in Yemen. Apparently. I said stuff like I didn't think the US was comparable to the Third Reich and they really didn't like that. Yang Qi: Heh, what a weak attack, I can't believe you have the face to use it against me, your energy arts are pathetic ^((compared to the ultimate energy art that is literally transforming me into God that I got for no apparent reason)^) I will genocide a few galaxies and make the multiverse worship me. Why? That's because they didn't provide one, but it's probably because of my participation in this: https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughCommieSpam/comments/eh8z0e/the_us_in_wwii_is_no_better_than_the_nazis/That bit above is the only interaction I ever had with the mods of that sub in its entirety. Rules weren't cited because I didn't break any. >I’m not voting for a candidate that would consider running with a Republican VP. The problem isn’t with just Trump. It’s with the entirety of the Republican PartyWhich is why Joe Biden said **there isn't** a Republican candidate who would meet his standard for VP! Christ, I can't believe I have to spell this out for you.>If you don’t understand that and Joe doesn’t understand that I don’t know what to say.The only issue here is you apparently have a difficult time understanding basic English. You're whining over something that Biden literally never fucking said. Apparently yes. > I’ve been opposing Trump and working my ass off. Pretty worthless if you aren't willing to vote against Trump.>If Biden is entertaining how he could possibly run with a Republican VP He's not. That's why everyone is questioning if you're illiterate or not.>then I’m opposing Trump more than Biden is. I’m not a Republican Then vote against the Republican candidate for President. Or throw a tantrum and don't. Just don't expect us to take your claims of being a liberal or a progressive seriously when you don't work to get Trump out of office.> I’m not a Republican and I’m not going to vote for someone who thinks it could ever be ok to have a Republican VP. This is ridiculous. Okay lets review what Biden actually said since you apparently have a difficult time understanding it.>"The answer is I would, **but I can't think of one now**," Biden replied. "Let me explain that. You know there's some really decent Republicans that are out there still, but here's the problem right now ... they've got to step up." "but" is a word in the English language that qualifies the preceding clause. So when Biden said "I would [consider a Republican VP]", he follows that with a but, indicating that the preceding was a hypothetical. It *depends* on their being a Republican candidate who meets conditions, and Biden goes onto explain that such a Republican candidate **DOES NOT EXIST**. Is this broken down enough for you to follow?>Apparently Biden supporters have no issue with the things the Republican Party have been supporting and neither does Biden.You're a really bad liar. Oh wow, a real life Bernout in the wild. Interesting. It's kind of hilarious watching you guys make excuses to not oppose Trump lmao. > though Rome has backed itself into a corner with their ecclesiology and they will need to admit faultI'd say there's a lot more than just ecclesiology. There's lots of stuff they've declared dogma that they'd have to at least be somewhat willing to compromise on, like the Immaculate Conception of the BVM as dogmatized in *Ineffabilis Deus*. Fortunately, I don't think there's any danger of that happening in the West.

I think it was some weird thing where the republican lawmakers threw some fit and refused to be present for the legislature to have a quorem for the budget or something really urgent, and the governor suggested if they kept it up he'd have the police bring them back for a session.I don't remember exactly but there was some kind of extenuating circumstance behind the possibility of having the lawmakers all brought to Eugene that I don't remember. Fun reminder: /r/the_donald is quarantined because that sub started calling for the assassination of Oregon State troopers. My point wasn't that disasters and cover ups never happen in democracies, but the reason events like Chernobyl occur is baked into communism far more deeply than democracy. I actually haven't, but I'm going to have to now. Well, internet overhaul was part of the Democratic platform in 2016, but rural voters were overwhelmingly against it so... ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Vaginal steaming. Amen! Joe 2020! /r/DebbieForPresident The horse shoe is real. I mean, he's technically correct: North Korea is generally considered a de facto absolute monarchy, not an oligarchy. My takeaway is that it's surprisingly difficult to defect lol. Neither did Hillary, but it ended up hurting her anyways. >Watching the recent debate, the thing that struck me the most was that Joe Biden seems to want to start WWIII with China. THAT is something that we can't turn back from if it happens.I'm so glad we're rekindling the "Hillary is a war hawk who will start WWIII over Syria!!!" bullshit from 2016. >There were 40 different billionaires that donated to his campaign.

They love their grandpa.>But other young people love Donald J Trump for the same reason, I suppose, right?>It's the "battle of the grandpas."Except the battle of the grandpa's is really Trump v Biden, the frontrunner beating Bernie by 10 points. One of the most interesting parts of 2019 was seeing how blatantly homophobic the far left is willing to get. Yes. No, because we already know. He was hired through his employer, a consultancy, to help Burisma implement better corporate goverce practices more in line with international business norms. Can someone tell me what regulation in this case would look like? Just ban these types of toys entirely? I'll confess I still have a third of a bottle of old spice 3 in one from college. Body wash, shampoo, and conditioner.Anyways I honestly have no idea wtf shower cream is. I get that everyone copes differently but this just feels super creepy. >If my grandma was about to die, I’d feel like a ghoul for posting a picture of her in a hospital bed for a bunch of anonymous strangers. I'm assuming the kid still died too. Tetanus is basically always fatal, after all. Fucking lol History isn't really their strong point. >What’s really funny is that you think that a parents hardest choices about the health of their child is driven by hate for another and not love for their child.Nobody's saying they hate their children. I don't think they hate their children. I just think they dislike autistic people and are incredibly stupid. Welp I'm confused. We're getting to way too many levels of inception here. It really speaks volumes about anti-vaxxers contempt for people with autism that they'd literally have their children die than have it.Of course, vaccines don't cause autism, so in reality there's nothing to worry about to begin with. It took me a really long time to figure out that those squiggles in the background were supposed to represent furniture. He's such a terrible artist.

IIRC the "Guild Wars" were some wars the old King of Ascalon fought in decades before the Prophecies storyline started? So the game story had nothing to do with them at all? Huh. I would *never* have guessed BDO to be anywhere near the top 5. >just because it's common doesn't mean it's not disgustingMy condolences then. 🙄>oh for fuck's sake, tell me one good thing about Hillary, I could tell you more better things for Warren...why would I care about tallying this up?

Is there a word for what bizarre shit Chinese economics and goverce is these days? >what the fuck is wrong with youI'm a normal American liberal? Pretty sure we make up most of the voting population. If you think my views are all that unusual you really ought to get out of the Reddit bubble. >and how did you get here?Someone once linked this sub in /r/forwardsfromgrandma. A subreddit about hating fascists has a pretty natural appeal for liberals.>bruh I understand Warren but fucking Hillary?Yes, Hillary is way better than Warren imo, but I suppose she'd be an okay candidate too. Yeah, pretty ironic for an antifascist subreddit. One person said that WWII was an unjust war, and using precise bunker buster technology on Hitler instead of having to besiege Berlin would have been no better than what happened, because the Weimar Republican and the Allies should have stopped the Nazis before they seized power.I'm honestly just confused. >Hot takes from wikipedia, “Joseph Lenin killed a bunch of people because he wanted their land.” Best if you stay out of this one because you have no knowledge.That's rich coming from an unironic communist who just described the Holodomor as a heatwave which was caused by evil landlords. You actually think people can manipulate weather patterns. >Everyone suffered that. Holodomor was a heat wave that swept through multiple countriesThis is incorrect: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor>The weather pattern was exacerbated by landlords hoarding????? I mean, in the sense that he suffered the most casualties, sure. I had one of those.  Welcome to Y'allabama. Jest keep on voting Teapublican.  That's how he did it, until he couldn't. He might be looking for company.  I sometimes just get so tired of this rehashed and recooked, with extra salt, "Orange Pappers" crap. AA not your thing? Then don't go there.I worked at a moderate-sized community general hospital as coordinator and developer of a 15-bed inpatient chemical dependency unit, a heavily modified Hazelden/Johnson model program, mid 70s through mid 80s. Had to make it fit in two weeks, all the hospital would give us.Due to federal and states (TN/VA) grant requirements we had to have a third party do annual followup studies. After the first five years of operation and for every year after that we maintained a 66% success/recovery rate for the over 5,000 patients we treated during the time I was there, about 1/3 of which were female.  https://www.recoveringfromrecovery.com/anti-aa-sites/ I was just coming to political awareness then. Distributed bumper stickers and buttons for him, and later worked for him (one of his Air Force medics).In that role I was able to get handshakes and a wave from him, was one of the last to see him alive in Washington (we covered all of his DC takeoffs/landings), was one of the first not present in Dallas to learn of the assassination, and one of the first to see his coffin as Air Force One returned. More so. Narcotics withdrawal just makes you wish to want to die. Have never heard of a case where narcotics withdrawal directly killed, tho I suppose it could contribute to the death of someone already having major other contributing medical issues (me: twenty (20) years in the chemical dependency field and 47 years sober).I have seen alcohol and other sedative-hypnotic withdrawal kill, all too often, with mine own eyes, in otherwise healthy people in their 20s. Personal manager says otherwise. Did you read the link? https://www.thenation.com/article/july-13-1960-john-f-kennedy-secures-the-democratic-presidential-nomination/ Corrected, left that out on first pass. Corrected, left that out on first pass. Alcoholism and the other related addictions are much more complex than that, but you don't have to understand all of the complexities to get and stay sober.For many but not all there is a very well documented actual genetically linked physical component - I am one of those. You don't have to have it to become alcoholic but it sure helps.'Personality' aspects are also a factor and everything that makes your personality can contribute, though by the time alcoholism develops which is chicken and which is egg becomes arguable. One thing is very well known and observed: whatever the causes and contributing factors worrying too much about those has killed more people than it has gotten people sober.Keep it simple, especially for now.You will learn more as you progress in sobriety.

I haven't put it on yet. Trying to decide if I should remove one or add it somewhere else.  ;)  The absolute last thing the GOP wants is educated voters and workers.That's why they have been actively seeking the destruction of our educational systems since Ronnie Raygun. Have never understood since my Air Force days (62-66) why the military and defense contractors can be so tilted towards the GOP. Was told in the AF it's because republicans support the troops. That has never been true, still isn't.  Thanks. Structural Poverty in the US is mostly a function of our politics, to seek and hold political power. Both sides play a role, with the GOP using it and its corresponding racist roots to convince their base that the 'undeserving poor' (almost always people of color) are the cause of poor white's woes) and the Dems using it to convince their base that 'we are the good guys'. We have rarely done anything to actually fix it, though FDR with the Minimum Wage and other programs and LBJ's War on Poverty being about the only serious attempts at a fix. The GOP used that too as an attack vehicle.  Just do it, you won't be any younger tomorrow. I returned to school at 27. Interesting the number of downvotes. /r/politics apparently has a strong homophobe contingent.  Missed that - removing  Missed that, removing. The same things happened with POC after Brown v. Board and the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, and is now being pursued for Roe v. Wade. So far we've been able to push back on those, needs to be done for the LBBT assault also. Perhaps the most important reason to turn the trumpster and all republcans out.  That's entirely normal, if there is such a thing.  We used to go to Myrtle Beach every year, from Tennessee. I still remember these signs as the first sign we'd crossed the border.  That's a very narrow window to prepare for. While trying to figure it out remember they need someone to just be there for them. You don't have time to become a grief counselor, so just be there. Try to figure out what you might want someone to say to you.  Yeah, but next time take him to a coffee shop. Set and settings can be powerful, sometimes overwhelming.  Another contemptable affront and insult to the office of the precidency, this country and the leaders of the G8.She was elected by no people to nothing. Precedent Bannon has spoken. Apparently not as simple as that - http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/trump-commission-requested-voter-data-heres-every-state-saying/ The "Food Stamps" welfare programs in their various iterations save lives, reduce the impacts of poverty and in many cases are a step up to getting out of poverty, which was the case for my Beverly.Every piece of objective data since the programs inceptions confirms this.Unfortunately the GOP has no use for real-world data, just a commitment to eliminating taxes. Those are not televison networks. http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/scoreboard-tuesday-july-4/334238 http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/scoreboard-tuesday-july-4/334238 I gonna use that somewhere :)  Frankly the average American sucks at history, especially about civics and government. This was a major contributing factor that lead to the trumpster.  Found Politifact's - reposting. Wierd - wasn't there last night, at least not for me. There now.Removing. Series of trolling comments and incivility - banned and removed. It does get better in time. The trick, if there is such a thing, is to hold it together until things start to make sense again, but that will come in time.Not saying 'you'll get over it', don't know that that ever happens, nor should it, but saying you can survive, and in time approach a level of functionality. Your life will continue, and you say kids are involved so it has to.There will be a hole in it, but you can survive and get better.It took me the better part of two years to start understanding that. Your request has been granted. You're beginning with a few false assumptions. 1) Banning: "Honestly, I see the same thing happen to users in this subreddit..."T_D has always pre-banned users with other than RWNJ thinking. Many, including me before I even knew the sub existed and I am by no means the only or for that matter well known on reddit. We at least do wait for a comment or post to demonstrate that derangement.2) Attacks: Most I no and I do not personally attack users, my 'targets' are content, the idea. This is a place where liberals tend to use facts, verifiable, sourced, facts. T_D users prefer fantasy, usually taken from the trumpster's latest tweet.  Huh? Unfortunately that's every day in Alabama.  Apparently your title didn't work. I'm going to try again. "It took a dead woman to make Tuscaloosa do the right thing | "The police failed her. The University failed her. DCH Regional Medical Center did not provide services she needed. In the end Megan took her own life. She killed herself.

We're going to sticky it for a while and include a shorter version in "Rules" sidebar. Granted, but they established a republic that made it possible for us, those who followed them, to abolish  such as slavery and work to improve and correct other ills and imperfections, on our journey to a "More Perfect Union". We are doing that, and the work continues.  For pres yes, for the nationals, congress-critters, we did.  "We" - the majority of voters, through national elections and the Electoral College, put that shitshow in DC.  "Maybe, this Independence Day, especially, we need to remember what we really fought for and what we stand for as a country. Trump and his apologists are making a mockery of our nation's core values. It's not okay for our Commander-in-chief to attack the free press or use Twitter to air his personal grievances. It's reprehensible that he doesn't know the difference between Medicare and Medicaid or that the White House didn't celebrate Pride month or Ramadan." #3.

As too many Democrats did after 35 years and hundreds of millions of dollars were spent to demonize Hillary Clinton. Only reporting my experience. As I said the populations involved were generally younger and generally healthier than normal populations. Most likely for complications already weeded out.  That's it, pretty much following the Air Force experience. This is not something I overheard or got through a grapevine - I was there, all of me, eyes, ears, everything. In the Air Force I knew more than half of those people personally, worked with them, lived with them.At the hospital I knew well over 200 of them personally, worked with them, partied with them, went to birthdays and weddings with them, even owed some of them money from time to time. I knew when they got sick, all of us did. Granted that for the most part this was a healthy group and comparatively younger than the general population, but still ...  Nope - can't muster the blind faith needed to support full atheism  Bad move, he needs to find another place to live, to stay alive.  Agree, but unfortunately there are way fewer of those, not enough squeaky wheels.  Another anecdote - I was an Air Force Medic, 1962-1966. All immunizations were mandatory except for individuals with medical contraindications. I have given them to probably somewhere north of 5,000 airmen, mostly pilots and air crews, including the flu vaccine of the year.Never ever saw a complication, due to the pre-screening, and saw with mine own eyes very damn few cases of the flu while civilians in the areas were dropping like flies, less than 10 cases of flu in four years.  Also worked in a large (about 1,000 staff at the time), public general hospital as an adjunct professional (alcoholism - other drug addictions treatment) for just over 15 years, where the hospital held to the same practice, mandatory immunizations for all staff excepting medically excused.I was only the recipient there - they wouldn't let me near needles. 15 years - less than 5 known cases of flu after the shot.

"The fair market rent in Atlanta for a two-bedroom apartment is $949, according to the NLIHC, citing 2016 data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. To afford that (defining "afford" as not paying more than 30 percent of one’s income on housing costs), an Atlanta renter would have to make $37,960 a year – which is a "housing wage" of $18.25 an hour."http://www.ajc.com/news/local/here-what-you-need-earn-afford-rent-atlanta/ymbNny0cS5loS8ILPE1FlN/ Nowhere in this country is the current minimum wage a living wage, it's barely survivable, so the country and the states have to make up some of the differences with such as public housing, other housing assistance, food stamps (now called snap) and Medicaid - in short by subsidizing the corporations like Walmart.

In fact, the average age of a minimum wage worker is 35, and they often earn half of their families’ total income.""The third myth is that raising one fair wage to $15 over time is bad for business. Raising the minimum wage for workers, including tipped workers, is good for the economy. I understand the anxiety of small businesses. I was a small-business owner myself once. But research has shown that locations with higher minimum wages don’t see more business failures — in fact, the businesses actually grow faster."http://www.startribune.com/three-myths-about-the-minimum-wage/428513483/"Minimum wage critics have strained to find good evidence that increases have a major employment effect; most studies find either no effect, or a very slight impact on the least-educated and -experienced workers.

"RESULTS: Nearly 1300 children die and 5790 are treated for gunshot wounds each year. Boys, older children, and minorities are disproportionately affected. Although unintentional firearm deaths among children declined from 2002 to 2014 and firearm homicides declined from 2007 to 2014, firearm suicides decreased between 2002 and 2007 and then showed a significant upward trend from 2007 to 2014. Rates of firearm homicide among children are higher in many Southern states and parts of the Midwest relative to other parts of the country. Firearm suicides are more dispersed across the United States with some of the highest rates occurring in Western states. Firearm homicides of younger children often occurred in multivictim events and involved intimate partner or family conflict; older children more often died in the context of crime and violence. Firearm suicides were often precipitated by situational and relationship problems. The shooter playing with a gun was the most common circumstance surrounding unintentional firearm deaths of both younger and older children."http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2017/06/15/peds.2016-3486http://www.cbsnews.com/news/accidental-gun-deaths-shooting-children-undercounted-cdc-ap-usa-today/Due to underreporting and misclassification the deaths and injuries are undercounted: "Every day, 7 children and teens die from gun violence:4 are murdered2 kill themselves.Every day, 40 children and teens are shot and survive:32 shot in an assault1 survives a suicide attempt8 are shot unintentionally"http://www.bradycampaign.org/key-gun-violence-statistics Perhaps, and hope you're right - but I don't trust trumpsters anywhere, esp. in historically republican districts.

There is nothing else in your life, ever, that will be harder to deal with than this.They're probably doctors who try outpatient detox, normally though the history of outpatient detox is fraught and not noted for success. As others have said withdrawal from sedatives like alcohol is truely dangerous and can kill you (the non-sedative drugs just make you wish you could die, but their withdrawal won't kill you - alcohol can and all too often does.) It almost killed me, not my fault I lived.You could try some local AA meetings, as many there will have knowledge and experience with local detox services, including what doctors might be trying this locally. You can (should) check out /r/stopdrinking, alternate/throwaway accounts o.k.This is coming from one who is not a voice in the wilderness. As any who know me know, because I make sure they know, I'm an alcoholic/other drugs addict with (currently) 47 years continuous sobriety and 20+ years experience in the chemical dependency treatment field - my second major career. I have some knowledge of what I speak.

Seriously aggravated his long-standing back injury and will take considerable recovery time to get over, if that even happens.  Wasn't at that one, but usually am. If you attend again look for the beard and hat.  McConnell has made a career of destroying political norms, but kicked that into overdrive when the Black Guy won the White House. McConnell will destroy the country for that, both to punish the country for doing it and to make sure it never happens again. I did about two years ago. Not accepted but that may have been a function of my age (70 then) and the fact I ain't gots no edykshun, at least not the kind they were looking for. Seems to be geared towards college students looking for internships and recent grads.  :) You too! Boyd and Nana have no chance at all, both were blown out last time, Boyd for rep., though he won the primary, and Nana for Senate, lost his primary. This is Alabama and being black a major problem for statewide office. Nana's other handicap is he is from Cameroon in West Africa and still has an extremely pronounced British-flavored African accent - in perhaps the most xenophobic state in this country. I've met both.Best shot IMO goes to Doug Jones - very high name recognition, very high approval rate. It's a longshot but he's the best chance Dems have had in over a decade - and the trumpster and supporters negatives are rising. It's possible.Frankly have never heard of the others, and I've been active in politics here since 2007.

Howdy :)  So in this case social media tags are allowed.  NBC has allowed Kelly to paint them in a corner on this one - they will not come out the other side unscathed. Sort of like a hangover - the day of the hangover you say 'never again'. A few weeks later most forget.  The problem is his views are still relevant. To point out the paradox six months later will go over the heads of many in this ADHD era. While the iron is hot more likely to be noticed, and considered.Who knows - maybe even he will now give it some thought.  So getting coincidentally shot (not specifically targeted, everyone on the field was a target) absolves his record? Being an accidental victim does not make one a hero, not even in baseball.  Don't think anyone said it did, except the shooter of course.  Forgot the "/s"? The fake business leader gets flunked by real ones. Damn! Hadn't thought of that.  "Minimum-wage opponents who claim that increases will cripple local economies, either overall or even in their low-wage sectors, thus get no help from the Seattle results. The study’s authors point out that one challenge in teasing out minimum-wage effects was that the Seattle economy “boomed” over this period, posting growth rates that “tripled the national average” and “outpaced Seattle’s own robust performance in recent years.”Yet, despite these expected, generally positive findings, the study’s press coverage has been pretty negative. Attacks from knee-jerk opponents of the minimum wage — who in some cases are paid by the low-wage employer and lobby to shoot at anything that moves, regardless of the evidence — were expected and are easily dismissed."https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/08/10/so-far-the-seattle-minimum-wage-increase-is-doing-what-its-supposed-to-do/?utm_term=.fbc82e6544e5 That's definitely a function.

For the miseducated and troll food:"1) Myth: The minimum wage was never supposed to be a living wageThis is probably one of the most dangerous—and easy to debunk—myths about the minimum wage, which was championed by Franklin D. Roosevelt beginning in 1933. During an address FDR gave about one of his many economic salvation packages, he explained that “no business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country.”At the time, Roosevelt’s Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938—passed as part of New Deal legislation—set minimum wage at 25 cents. Roosevelt intended this rate to be “more than a bare subsistence level.” The minimum wage was created expressly to ensure that people of all skill-levels, if they worked, could “earn a decent living” off those wages—thus, a living wage."http://www.salon.com/2015/08/04/the_7_most_dangerous_myths_about_the_fight_for_a_15_minimum_wage_partner/"Adjusted for inflation, the federal minimum wage peaked in 1968 at $8.68 (in 2016 dollars). Since it was last raised in 2009, to the current $7.25 per hour, the federal minimum has lost about 9.6% of its purchasing power to inflation. Back in 2015, The Economist estimated that, given how rich the U.S. is and the pattern among other advanced economies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, “one would expect America … to pay a minimum wage around $12 an hour.”http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/04/5-facts-about-the-minimum-wage/' Of course, if the commenter, himself, had “read history,” he would see that, in fact, the minimum wage was always supposed to be a living wage. In fact, to argue that the minimum wage was never supposed to be a living wage is completely anachronistic.In his 1933 address following the passage of the National Industrial Recovery Act, President Franklin D.

Back in 2015, The Economist estimated that, given how rich the U.S. is and the pattern among other advanced economies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, “one would expect America … to pay a minimum wage around $12 an hour.”http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/04/5-facts-about-the-minimum-wage/' Of course, if the commenter, himself, had “read history,” he would see that, in fact, the minimum wage was always supposed to be a living wage. In fact, to argue that the minimum wage was never supposed to be a living wage is completely anachronistic.In his 1933 address following the passage of the National Industrial Recovery Act, President Franklin D. Roosevelt noted that “no business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country.” 'https://thebillfold.com/it-was-always-supposed-to-be-a-living-wage-a6d4cf3c7ab1Bonus: https://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/07/f-d-r-makes-the-case-for-the-minimum-wage/?mcubz=2 This would be a very good thing if it happens. http://politiseek.com/2017/04/percentage-of-walmart-employees-on-welfare/https://www.sheilakennedy.net/2017/04/the-walmart-tax/ Yep - but he retweeted it.  I'm insured for everything but dinosaur bites. Took my first training at daddy's knee, literally - started teaching me to shoot properly at age 10. Vietnam Vet. Last license renewal two years ago, training involved. Have to renew in two more years if I'm still here (72 at the moment).  You mighta missed him on CNN this morning - taking as if he never said anything like the year ago tweet. He was there at the shooting.  That could work, sorta like it - but still not sure it's worth the effort  just yet.  :)  The original tweet and 'thought' behind it? Complete and total disagreement and opposition to - to my dying breath on my last day. I'm kinda closer to Scalia on this one - 'Reasonable Regulation'.Reasonable including:Background checks on all sales and transfers.Mandatory weapons safety training, refreshed every 5 years at least, with a certificate that must be shown and confirmed on all sales and transfers anywhere.  Mandatory liability insurance.That'll do for openers.  Nor do I, ain't the point. The point was sometimes karma bites you on the (body part here).  In no way do I support any guns everywhere by anyone and everyone at any and all times,  or shooting politicians or other officials, or humans in general. Not that crazy about shooting other animals either. I do hate the NRA for foisting this bullshit nonsense off on idiots, most looking for a testosterone replacement as they have little to none. Pretty much a non-sequitur but I already have two, and a CCW - how many more do I need?  So when is it o.k. to highlight the hypocrisy? When it's forgotten and no longer relevant?

We might want to revisit this when we break 1,000. The trumpster's GOP are destroying the First Amendment and the Fourth Estate. That's because there isn't any. It's all privatization and tax breaks for billionaires.  Republicans - totally dedicated to destroying America one trump-trick at a time.The GOP truly is the party of hate.

Will check into it, but [this is a sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYqzckeSKrU) of what the GP4 could do with the [AxcessAbles ODM-2 Microphone Kit for GoProCameras Hero4](https://www.amazon.com/AxcessAbles-ODM-2-Microphone-GoProCameras-Hero4/dp/B01AS57UZY) - it is of course zoomed and reframed from original.Was hoping for a similar answer. Yep -internal mic not that good for speakers talking sometimes up to 30 feet or more away from where I'm stationed. Even when using a PA system sound is tinny/rumbly, and almost always too low for clarity, especially when the speaker is interacting with the audience. Sound sources all over the place.  I made the mistake of trading my GP4 in for the 5, when the 4 worked great with external mics, no muss, no fuss.   Ditto. That among other things.  Can anyone explain to me how this is constitutional, as it appears to negate the confrontation clause? [The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that "in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right…to be confronted with the witnesses against him." Generally, the right is to have a face-to-face confrontation with witnesses who are offering testimonial evidence against the accused in the form of cross-examination during a trial. The Fourteenth Amendment makes the right to confrontation applicable to the states and not just the federal government. The right only applies to criminal prosecutions, not civil cases or other proceedings.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confrontation_Clause) A drunk alcholic can be pretty horrible. Sober ones not so bad.  "Bill W." - William Griffith Wilson, died in January 1971. I read about that in a Time Magazine that somehow got left on an airplane I was in going from Spring Grove Psychiatric Hospital that I'd just been kicked out of after six unproductive months, my third such discharge from other similar facilities in the preceding three years, to my mother back in Nebraska to be 'taken care of' since no one understood me.All I could remember thinking was thank god that sob was dead, now maybe AA would die and I wouldn't have to hear about it anymore. Family and friends, while I still had them, had been trying to get me to check them out for several years and I was sick of hearing about it. Fortunately I got lucky.Some assholes, two of which I later learned had known Bill W., scraped me off a back alley in Lincoln just before I would have died after my last three-month binge, Labor Day weekend 1971 and started teaching me I didn't have to die that way.Later on I couldn't help wondering - coincidence, or ...?TL;DR: I got sober the year Bill W. died, through the lifesaver he founded.  That one and a couple more - then and now running against Obama. Someone might tell him Obama is on no ballot nowhere. Hell - it would probably boost his chances. He's won at least one state-wide election (AG) with something similar.  No longer just a song - "Bang bang, he shot me down / Bang bang, I hit the ground / Bang bang, that awful sound / Bang bang, my baby shot me down… " And that's a fact. Haven't since Raygun.

As has been true since the founding of the Republic, more so since the suffragettes first emerged. If he's still in office I would hope so, as I see nothing he's proposed so far that does not do serious harm to the country. Point is she's been against the trumpster from the beginning, not a 'capitalization' attempt recently adopted.  What does this have to do with this post? Off topic much? Or just routine spam.

Straining at gnats is not my forte. Oh hardly just me - most of the planet:"Christopher Loffrado "Chris" Hayes (/heɪz/; born February 28, 1979) is a liberal / progressive American political commentator, journalist, and author. Hayes hosts All In with Chris Hayes, a weekday news and opinion television show on MSNBC. Hayes formerly hosted a weekend MSNBC show, Up with Chris Hayes. He remains an editor at large of The Nation magazine."https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hayes_(journalist)"Asked about her political views by the Valley Advocate, Maddow replied, "I'm undoubtedly a liberal, which means that I'm in almost total agreement with the Eisenhower-era Republican party platform.""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Maddow"O'Donnell began his political career as an aide to U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and was Staff Director for the Senate Fice Committee. He has described himself a "practical European socialist.""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_O%27Donnell Because the shows driving the ratings - Hayes. Maddow & O'Donnell are progressive, as well as Arri, Joy and a few others. Excepting Joe's show most of the cons aren't doing that well.  That's what I was looking for when this popped up. Haven't found yet any info on her condition. Everyone responds differently to almost everything of course, but I'm three decades older than she is and although this year's flu wiped me out for over a week (had my shot, but the older you get the less effective they are), I was still able to function after about 8 days. I'm worried it's something else.  Someone remind me - which one was an immigrant? The move is to teach it accurately. The glamorizations of the Confederacy need to die.

Hell, I don't want a plumber with no experience either, nor a car mechanic. Our government is already amateur enough.  Wow!  Wonder how he will reward them.  Varies a bit, depending on the celeb's native intelligence or lack thereof (Ted Nugent comes to mind), but many celebs' opinions are also shaped by their fan base, many of whom they interact with, subjecting them to a wider range of views.IOW - informed and knowledgeable. Where that is the case their opinions and influence carry much more weight than some functionally anonymous Redditor, facebooker or twitterer.  Pretty much all of us can be affected by what is perceived to be 'popular' opinion. If a thousand people are saying 'yes' what is the point of saying 'no'.It's a fundamental principle of all propaganda.So - how do we know that it's 'people' shaping that opinion? The absurdity of this boggles. The gun nuts are already the most over-protected snowflakes on the planet.Disclaimer: I'm a Vietnam vet, licensed CCW. Been shooting since I was 10.

The world of the trumpster.  #trumpsAmerica Please stop using the word "hacked" in referring to the election and the result. That word has a specific meaning that does not apply and makes us look like conspiracists.Yes, some emails were hacked, but not the election itself, and voting machines and results were not hacked.It was coordinated and planned widely spread fake news and misleading propaganda, as well as lots of money, along with overwhelming media irresponsibility that gave us the trumpster, not hacking.

The results conclusively demonstrate that Americans, in their deepest political/social beliefs, are thoroughly liberal in most of their views and moderately liberal in the balance. They are not the “conservatives” described by the relentless propagandists of the right. Further, while these collective views have decidedly tilted toward the more moderate-to-progressive in recent years, this reality about what Americans actually think (as opposed to whom they vote for) has been consistent since Barack Obama began his presidential campaign and on some issues well before that."http://www.nationalmemo.com/americans-really-believe/Also see: https://www.wired.com/2016/12/dont-let-trumps-win-fool-americas-getting-liberal/And there are more. Many, many more.  As they have from the beginning. ObamaCare had some addressable faults. The GOP blocked every single attempt to fix - just and only to keep the Black Guy from getting a win.They didn't and don't care how many die because of it. This also applies to progressives, as it started with them:"And, my friends, in this story you have a history of this entire movement. First they ignore you. Then they ridicule you.

Not to mention destructive, futile and stupid. With maybe the exception of California, any state stupid enough to secede would immediately become a fourth world country. All of their military/defense gone, up to a third or more of their funding gone, boarders instituted (passports required, no visas or entry or exit allowed to the rest of the union), etc. etc. ad nauseam.IOW - suicide.   "What about Texas, which according to legend retains its own special secession clause? Supreme Court Justice Salmon P. Chase settled that question all the way back in 1869:When, therefore, Texas became one of the United States, she entered into an indissoluble relation. All the obligations of perpetual union, and all the guaranties of republican government in the Union, attached at once to the State. The act which consummated her admission into the Union was something more than a compact; it was the incorporation of a new member into the political body. And it was final. The union between Texas and the other States was as complete, as perpetual, and as indissoluble as the union between the original States. There was no place for reconsideration or revocation, except through revolution or through consent of the States.So sorry, angry states: this is probably a dead end."http://www.businessinsider.com/no-you-cannot-secede-from-the-united-states-2012-11 Nixon was prologue, but the field has changed - for the worse. No, I didn't. Review the greedyoldpricks history since 2007. The most accurate political statement ever. How big is your basket?

There's more, lots and lots more.  Does anyone remember what else happened in the '80s?I remember what happened in the '80s!Ronnie Raygun & his merry band of destroyers happened in the '80s, and has been continuing and worsening ever since. Granted, but make them jump through the same hoops and we don't need guns provided to them. As to the criminal aspect the same thing. For the most part their guns come from the streets and gun shows. As to giving ready access to a bunch of college kids I stand my ground, for the most part most of them are nowhere near ready. You still haven't answered the original questions.  Maybe I should add: Born in a fishing, hunting gun-owning culture. Got my first gun at age 10, and taught properly how to use it. As indicated a Vietnam vet. Made a small living for a few years as a gunsmith. Currently a licensed CCW. I'm not an anti-gun person. I am anti idiots, criminals, mentally ill and other fools having guns. That includes those emotionally and intellectually undeveloped.  I lived in Vietnam for a year, 1965-1966, also never got shot. Still don't want a redo. You didn't answer the questions.Also, how is observing reality driving a wedge?  Did you ever live on campus? If so do you remember it? Especially game days, Friday and Saturday nights? A bunch of armed immature emotional drunks and druggies is not something I care to visit.  Pretty much hated the hippies then, in the beginning. Came back from Vietnam in 66, met at the plane by a bunch of 'hippie' demonstrators shouting 'Baby Killer', I was a medic. When I got back to D.C. gave a ride to a small group who were at least dressed as hippies who spent their time in my car calling LBJ, my old boss (I was one of his Air Force medics before being sent over) Stalin, Lenin and worse. Then in 1971 I started getting sober, and as a part of that process began incidentally to actually learn more about them, and in the doing some of the advent of the stereotypes and the role Nixon played in creating those stereotypes. Not too long after that people began calling me 'Hippie'. Some still do.

Deleting. Turnout was about 100, filled the room. Moderator kept things moving along pretty well, no one was allowed to dominate, all got equal time. Audience members were able to ask their own questions, about 10 did before time ran out. Connectivity was a mess, kept getting kicked off, but my gopro should have it all once I process it. One candidate was a no show, will have to review my footage to remember who (I was busy trying to keep the connection alive).There will be other similar events, though my understanding is those will focus on specific issues. Example of one Q&A:Q: what will you do to improve the education system?Woodfin: need to take a comprehensive look at early education, summer education, reading initiatives. Woods: industrial programs need to come back. We have to help our children succeed in life. Sims: many of our 8th graders can't do math or read and we need responsible school board members. Hill: need to allocate more funds from city hall and from state representation. Encourage school board to get rid of corruption. Bell: need to change education system. Need citizen ownership of school system and understanding of own culture. Chaverst: implement citywide youth commission and educational trust fund. Davis: better communication and accountability.

It's not only about how much he did or didn't pay. It will also reveal income sources and other tax-related info that can clear up who he has obligations to, like the Russian Oligarchy for example. Like what industries own him, etc.  As long as there are no outstanding obligations between the two (i.e.: owing the other money, history of fights, dealer relationship, etc.) there's no inherent problem. Can be a positive.  You are under no obligation to live up to anyone else's expectations, and there is no hurry. Go at your own pace - it's more comfortable that way.

Posted here by accident - now just counting the seconds before it's yanked (not exact title)  Often in the same sentence or interview. Chris Hayes is only one of many who've demonstrated that.

"It was in the middle of 2013, former staffers say, that Mason issued an edict saying Bentley was not to be shown negative news, whether in daily briefings or conversation.It was shocking to those who had helped him reach office. Anyone in power needs truth as armor. They need someone to tell them to shut up or to brush their teeth, or to warn them when political winds blow ill." Poor little whiny liar.

Who else would vote for this jerk? Rex Tillerson is an absolute and total disgrace and an enemy of our country. Every single thing he does damages the State Department. This but the latest example. Remember and never forget, the Kochs are still enemy #1. Although inadvertent it was their mechanizations that gave us the trumpster. People. Get involved with people. Join some local clubs/groups that you have interest in or think you may have interest in. Astronomy clubs, book clubs, civic involvement groups, activists groups of many stripes, cooking clubs - anything. That means that you meet people with at least some things in common, and you start to get yourself out of your own head - it's lonely in there. With any luck, in time, and not as long as you may now think, a sense of normalcy starts to return. Then life starts to take care of itself, and - who knows, maybe some aspirations and dreams come back.For reasons of my own interest I got involved with some local political groups and along came Mary. Neither of us there for that, neither looking, but we met and clicked (liberal-progressives are a rarity in Alabama).  Look up 'rhetorical', as in rhetorical question. Outside of 'So You Think You Can Dance' - no.  As it has been for well over two centuries - by design: "Unto the Seventh Generation", and beyond unless someone finds a way to stop it. http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1900 Yep, at least. Almost everyone in Bama knows it was a pay-it-forward. I'll put our political corruption up against all other states. To a certain extent it applies to both parties.  :(  And the pre-indictment denials begin ... moar popcorn please. Why would the trumpster fire the guy who got him elected? In time the dreams come back. Not the same as before perhaps, but they come back. As sometimes do we all ;)  Hmmm - I object. 71 year old here :)  My age is easy enough to determine. Markers: Born three days before Hiroshima bombing, first job away from home one of JFK's and LBJ's Air Force medics.  Have voted in every election since 1968, the first year I could (voting age was 21 then). Never missed one - including voting for Nixon in my drunk years (sober since 71).Will also be voting in every election from here as long as above ground. My opinions are here on reddit, twitter and a few others. Read that again, and find a mirror.  By their feathers you know the bird. Uh - everyone does know you never read al.com's comments, right?  You did copy this from The_Donald, right? You spend a lot of time there. Another autosearch fail.  Will give it a shot - thanks. Similar already submitted. Dunno - were there any Bernie rallies up there? We had about 7k show up for the one in Bham, tho that included bunches from elsewhere, including GA, TN and more than a handful from Huntsville.  Only if we vote, in Obama-class numbers. Right now the only hat in the ring is Willam Boyd. He's the guy who lost last time. Problems include he's black in a 69% Alabama-White district and he's a rather religious pastor, therefore the social issues veer away from standard democrat preferences. It would be nice if we could find someone better.  Have not seen anyone else report that. You might try an alternate browser next time. It's a short letter to editor, here is the text:"As a constituent of Congressman Mo Brooks, I was most disappointed to learn Congressman Brooks has no interest in my concerns or anything I mightFoolishly, I had hoped Brooks believed he was charged with representing all the citizens of his district. However, in recent interviews Congressman Brooks has explained his refusal to hold town hall meetings. He is concerned about allowing Democrats, socialists, criminal-style types, anarchists and disruptors an opportunity to “spread their anti-American values.”Brooks, when you look at me, is that what you see? I am a retired school teacher who has lived here all my life. I raised a family here and buried my love ones here, but if I identify with another party I am anti-American?Do you believe the elderly couple standing outside your closed event and holding a sign saying “Protect Medicare” are criminal types? The mother who holds the sign asking you to protect public education, is she an anarchist? Are none of us your constituents?I have never been a fan of uimous votes. I believe democracy is best served by the vigorous exchange of differing views with the goal of mutually beneficial solutions. It appears, sir, you do not agree.I believe you have dismissed many of us from your care and consideration. So be it. I suggest you seek the wisdom of founding father George Mason on such decisions.Phyllis E. RomineFlorence" I mostly agree with Milbank here, but even Milbank minimizes the destruction not just of the senate but of American government in total, beginning with his racist blood feud against everything Obama, therefore and thereby supporting the legitimization of the teabaggers and the obliteration of over 200 years of senate conventions - just because a Black Guy won the White House. They did that when they elected Raygun. He preferred the constitutionally required congressional action - which the GOP refused to consider. With the trumpster it's Katie bar the door, open season, screw the constitution in every position possible.  What heart? Where is it? Coming? It's already raging at full tilt. So why did the Greedy Old Pricks block Obama's attempts to do similar for similar? Need to add a couple $k to that, each:Unit cost	US$1.59m(FY2014)[1] (Block IV)So, about a $94,000,000.00 just for the missiles, which of course does not include the costs of the crews, fuel, ships, et. al. to launch them from.

Length of time is not the only or even most important measure of a relationship.  Just about everyone except the 26% who voted for him, and some of them are falling away. Obama hate still lives on the right. When the dice come up snake eyes every single time it's time to examine them. Breitbart 'keeping it real'? Right.  Keep it civil. There are a lot of us who had similar experiences. Some paid higher prices than others. Compared to others my price was small, only hurt my ego, but it also taught a lesson. Sometimes, when we're lucky, we can learn from the first mistake. Good luck. Was being a bit facetious. 26% of the electorate actually voted for him. He's going to lose a few of those so my guess is the bottom will be about 22% +/-2. I wonder if any US politician made it to zero. The trumpster is trying. The last time the #GreedyOldPricks wanted to block the debt increase they almost destroyed the US credit rating. With the trumpster they may finish the job.

There is much evidence to support that alcoholism has a genetic component for many (though not all), but just growing up in an alcoholic environment can induce its own stressors that, although may not cause alcoholism can still affect personality.

Alabama here - insanity is putting it mildly. The average 'bama conservative would cut his hand off if it would prevent some 'undeserving other' from benefiting from anything. Consequently bamans stay broke, fat, have some of the worst roads and schools on the planet, and people die way too early from easily preventable causes.

That's one of them. I was at the local sister march in Bham. In the case of the Womens March in DC local groups (Alabama Democratic Reform Caucus, Forward Alabama, Over the Mountain Democrats) and other groups and individuals did raise funds to help send about 500 there, but that is all local money for local residents, and does not count the almot equal number who drove themselves.  Of who do you speak? I was/am one of the protestors and know or know of most others. None I know are paid, all are local to Bham, and I've never seen a lunch at any event I've been to.

"I hope you can join me on February 11th for the 11th annual Moral March on Raleigh & HKonJ People's Assembly. This mass mobilization has happened every February since 2007. It is a time when the North Carolina NAACP and over 200 coalition partners come together with people from across the nation to show our unity and reaffirm our intersectional People's Agenda for North Carolina. This march is more important than ever.We are focusing on our moral duty to stand against the repeal of the life-saving Affordable Care Act, the legislative tyranny of our extremist-led General Assembly, the racist and unconstitutional gerrymandering which undermines the vote of all North Carolinians, the anti-family, anti-worker, and anti-LGBTQ hate bill 2, and the extremism and lies of Trumpism , which undermine our Democracy at the federal and local level. Donald Trump and his administration have undermined our Democracy and democratic institutions by making regressive federal appointments and inviting white nationalists into the White House. They have demonized our immigrant and Muslim sisters and brothers by building a wall on our Mexican border, pushing through an Executive Order that effectively bans many refugees and Muslims from our country, and blaming Latinos for voter fraud that does not exist.I know that the struggles that we face in our state are not unique. We have seen a rise in extremism across the nation. The Moral Movement here in North Carolina has national implications and we are encouraging people from around the country to join us. We are also seeing a rise in moral resistance. The Women's March showed us that the country is ready for a moral revolution of values. The Moral March on Raleigh on February 11th is essential to deepening this fight across the South.There are several ways that you can support the Moral March on Raleigh.First and foremost, I hope that you and your leadership will join us on Saturday, February 11th. You can find more information about the time, location, and logistics by clicking here. We hope you will also share information about the Moral March on Raleigh with your members or organizational affiliates, particularly those in North Carolina. If you need more information or resources, you can email laurel@naacpnc.org.You can also support the Moral March through social media. Click here to view the Moral March Digital Action Guide which provides several tools and describes a video campaign we are using to promote the Moral March across the country."https://docs.google.com/document/d/199WYvLBMyNBcAkAsjncHnLyHPxPXDL93iunyHoTbjVs/edit :)  They were all over CNN this weekend.

Does not apply to the prime time block, Hayes, Maddow, O'Donnell - but becoming more domit elsewhere. At least not yet. Conservatives are the real 'snowflakes' - terrified of their own shadows. The demonstrations, marches and rallies ARE 'doing something'. They are getting and keeping people involved. They are keeping the pressure on, and increasing it. They can lead to change, esp. in 2018 and 2020. One of the big problems of 2016 was more people didn't vote than did for any candidate. The rallies will help increase turnout.The rallies are also having 'right now' effects, like the blowback against selling public lands caused the repubs to back off and drop it.  According to my sources in the area the 'riots' were not caused by protestors, but some gangs of thugs who try to attend any large event to take advantage of the crowds.  Take a walk over to /r/The_Donald if you really want want to see hate on reddit.  Some Jews were also Nazis, as is Spencer.
