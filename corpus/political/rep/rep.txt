Every single thing that gets posted gets downvoted severely by liberals, including the comments within. This is the REPUBLICAN subreddit. If you are a liberal and you are in here - you are going to agree with NOTHING.I have NEVER been to the /r/liberal subreddit - because I know there is very little that I will agree with there, and I have enough respect for differing opinions to leave them alone on their own subreddit.The ENTIRE /r/Politics subreddit is completely overrun by liberal Bias. Maybe if /r/politics wasn't a liberal circle-jerk, liberals could argue in the general politics section and would not have to come to /r/republican to find things to disagree with.I would imagine that the number of republicans on Reddit is dropping by the day as a result of every subreddit being overrun with liberal downvotes. It's a sad day when they hive mind of Reddit drives away all voices of opposition.Liberals - is this what you want? You want all of reddit to be /r/circlejerk for your political views?Republicans - share with us some sites where you go to have intelligent political conversation that is not overrun by sneering, runny nose liberals that only want to squelch opposition through power in numbers and not through actual debate.If you are a republican reading the comments, you'll probably have to click the plus signs next to them, as the liberals in here are downvoting our republican ideas and opinions below the comment threshold in every thread. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  :::: Edit to point out that I've received so many liberal downvotes while only posting in /r/republican that I have restrictions on my commenting now.

THAT'S who Mitt Romney is. He's not a red-faced flip-flopper that speaks in monotone and touts his wife like a campaign poster, yet for some reason that's what the Republican Party changed him into.The GOP tried to mold him into some kind of weird interdimensional ball of clay that conservatives, moderates, AND independents would vote for. This was the GOP's undoing this election cycle. Had they let Mitt Romney just be himself, that is to say had they let the "concession speech Romney" run for president rather than the dilapidated husk of a man they created, the GOP would have likely run away with this election.Moral of the story: the problem had nothing to do with the candidate Republicans nominated. The problem was what they *did* with that candidate.**EDIT 1**: Whoa, way more responses than there were when I last checked this three hours ago!

I earned everything I own through my own hard work just like anyone else. But the Democrats can't see past my ethnicity. When they see me, they see someone who is below them and therefore needs their help. This is patronizing and insulting. The right sees me differently. When they see me, they expect me to work for my own rewards without any handicaps nor special concessions because they know I'm equal to everyone else. And I proved them right. If you don't believe me, see the massive welcome T_D gave me the day I finally got my citizenship. https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/8jocfl/legal_mexican_immigrant_here_my_naturalization/ No one can read that thread and still accuse us of being racist.As for being a Russian bot, I have ten years of Reddit history. It's really sad how the left can't even conceive of disagreement to the point where the only plausible explanation they'll accept is 'the Russians did it'. That's it. My #walkaway story. Ask me anything. I'm ready to be downvoted too, which only proves my point about leftist intolerance. If you really think the left supports minorities, just watch how they treat us the moment we disagree with their ideology: https://www.reddit.com/r/walkaway/comments/8xvz5d/legal_mexican_immigrant_here_just_became_a/e267xjg/ . Called a sell-out.EDIT: downvoted immediately, as predicted. This is exactly what I mean.EDIT 2: thanks to everyone who commented, even the guy who found a six year-old post from before I walkedaway, I feel it proves I'm not a Russian bot, and the people on the left who berated me, thank you too because you proved the point, even if you deleted the comments by now. And lastly, thanks so much to everyone who welcomed me and accepted me as one more American. It's all I ever wanted to be, and the feeling of pride and accomplishment it gives me would not be possible if I had just been given this without any effort, or by cheating. I'm happy to raise my family in the best country in the world, and happy to know I earned it, and keep earning it every day.With that said, it's time for me to go to work, so I may be slow with future replies. And have great day all.EDIT 3: another naturalized American born in Mexico, getting the same treatment I was getting last night: https://www.reddit.com/r/walkaway/comments/8y048t/i_was_born_in_mexico_but_became_an_american/ nan nan nan nan nan nan nan Please keep on believing! I love you all each and everyone! Any and everyone are loved and welcome in the USA!!!!  nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan Many former Democrats have recently been ‚Äúred-pilled‚Äù. Some here have wanted to leave for some time, but have feared the consequences they might suffer from friends or family if they walk away.But this campaign also serves another very important purpose. For far too long, the left has controlled the narrative in this country in news and media while the ‚Äúsilent majority‚Äù on the right have done what they always do‚Äîremained silent. The left has been allowed for so long to reinforce the narrative that everybody on the right is a bigot, a racist, a homophobe, a misogynist, etc. But the left has become so extreme, it‚Äôs now time to fight back. I want people on the right to use their voices and tell the world the truth about who they are. Please make a video telling everyone what it means to be a conservative in America. What your values really are. Tell minorities on the left who have been told their whole lives that they are not welcome on the right because of the bigotry and hatred of the people on the right that they are welcome. That there is a seat at the table on the right for everybody.This is a movement of patriots of all walks of life- men, women, black, brown, white, straight, LGBT, religious, un-religious, who share something very important in common... we are Americans. And we want our country back. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan ##Just kidding! Just so you all know, we are currently being brigaded by ‚Äúformer‚Äù default subreddit /r/AdviceAnimals for [‚ÄúBeing a pathetically transparent scam by ‚ÄúRussian Trolls.‚Äù](http://archive.is/jqMav) If you look further in the comments of that normie meme sub, their supposed evidence for their very strong claim they are propagating seems to be [this post here]( http://archive.is/sEtZ1) from someone in /r/politics (the true bastion of political neutrality! /s) In that post, they quote and refer to [this one thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/walkaway/comments/8x7ys1/i_volunteered_for_bernies_campaign_and_even_saw/?st=jjelkul1&sh=0bc3f658) which was made by a pretty obvious troll that was called out in the comments, their post was completely buried in downvotes, and their account was soon suspiciously deleted as well. Based on that one troll post and another questionable comment that was downvoted in the same thread, they think it‚Äôs now okay to conflate everyone who follows and posts to this community as ‚ÄúRussian Trolls‚Äù, even if it couldn‚Äôt be further away from reality. They are also trying to conflate a laughably tiny number of suspicious Russian accounts on twitter who hijacked #WalkAway to be representative of the entire movement as well, because Radical Leftists can‚Äôt possibly accept that they are rapidly pushing away moderate leftists and centrists thanks to very silly instances like this (And because most of them are BATSHIT INSANE!)The truth is the [#WalkAway]( https://twitter.com/hashtag/walkaway) movement was started by [Brandon Straka]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwsrPYUazq8), and since it‚Äôs conception has gained lots of traction thanks to other prominent leaders such as [Candace Owens]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLmuN4TTKSU) and [Scott Adams]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRoj_2fY7sc). And at this point in time, the movement has [completely blown up in popularity!](https://twitter.com/deliason12/status/1012368162786955264?lang=en)  So yeah, please keep dismissing everyone who disagrees with you as ‚ÄúRussian Bots‚Äù and see how far that gets you. In the meantime we will continue to MAGA! nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan This isn‚Äôt about a change of opinions, it‚Äôs about waking up and realizing you‚Äôre being lied to and manipulated. There is a world of difference between what Democrats and liberal politicians say they do/stand for and what they‚Äôre *actually* doing. Dave Rubin did a great video about it that was posted on here recently [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiVQ8vrGA\_8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiVQ8vrGA_8). Essentially, the left is no longer liberal, they've embraced authoritarian progressivism. But it‚Äôs not just the crime, it‚Äôs the cover up. They are skilled operators and have done an expert job deceiving us. Half the country is still convinced that the fate of humanity and the planet depends on liberal/leftist politicians defeating the evil conservatives. The reason it‚Äôs so hard for liberals to believe we‚Äôre walking away in 2018 is that it‚Äôs so hard to convince people that so much of what they believe is simply false. It‚Äôs extra difficult to convince them when they think that the 90% negative coverage of Trump reflects reality and the only thing his supporters like about him is either fake news, alternative facts, or attributable to intolerance. For example, compare the media coverage of Obama‚Äôs presidency vs. Trump‚Äôs presidency. Is it not odd that the mainstream media hasn‚Äôt been very critical or did much investigating of Obama‚Äôs major scandals? When it came to Fast and Furious, the secret payments to Iran, the media seemed to always take the administration‚Äôs word on things and were quick to exonerate him instead of seeing where the facts led. Check out this Ted talk by Sheryl Attkison, a real journalist who has been alienated in her field for investigating ‚Äúright wing conspiracies,‚Äù like Fast and Furious and the administration‚Äôs narrative on Benghazi [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQcCIzjz9\_s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQcCIzjz9_s). Everyone wants to believe that Obama was the Obama of his speeches, a competent leader we could trust to guide the ship. Well the media had a big job in crafting this image for him, but it‚Äôs almost entirely a fa√ßade. He is not who you think he is. You probably have an idea who Hillary is unless you‚Äôre totally drinking the kool-aid. I‚Äôm not saying Trump is always totally honest, but keep in mind the public just recently decided to start holding the president accountable. Why were we so credulous when Obama fed us alternative facts? Because according to the media Obama was normal, and Trump is not.If you ever wonder why the media tends to coalesce around the same narrative, look into their coordination with organizations like Media Matters, Shareblue, and Talking Points Memo, and you‚Äôll see how much of the news is spun in someone‚Äôs favor. Or that you‚Äôre only seeing an article because somebody ordered a smear campaign. Obviously this is true of Fox too, but Fox‚Äôs real reporting that differs from CNN/MSNBC/NPR is automatically dismissed as right wing propaganda. Why assume CNN is any different? This is why alternative media has become so important. Democrats also contract fact checking sites like snopes and politifact‚Ä¶conflict of interest? They‚Äôre also masters of SEO and know how to get their ‚Äúfair and objective‚Äù ruling at the top of google search results.  We can‚Äôt keep acting like mainstream news is the only thing we can trust. Do you really believe the media is committed to telling the truth when their interests are challenged? See what famous lefty Noam Chomsky says about it in ‚ÄúNecessary Illusions: Thought Control in Democratic Societies.‚Äù https://preview.redd.it/le8izw9idzc11.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=548172c97ff440644940c3f548cf7f6504abb3ffThere is no telling how deep the corruption and lies go. It‚Äôs not just Government and the news media either, it‚Äôs Hollywood, Universities, Silicon Valley, etc. telling us what the good and proper things to say and think are. It‚Äôs frightening once you know how much EU/china-fication has come to the USA under the guise of progressivism. This is why I said walking away is about waking up, you realize how much of what you‚Äôve been told is a lie.And yet all we hear about is Russia. Has anyone heard that a week ago the release of FISA documents confirms the suspicion that the entire rationale of the investigative was the discredited Steele dossier which was paid for by the Democrats (and the FBI knew the Dems paid for it)? This is from NYT, not just Fox and conservative alternative media sites anymore. However Charlie Savage tells us that the indictments prove the investigation is legitimate [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/21/us/politics/carter-page-fisa.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/21/us/politics/carter-page-fisa.html). Any informed person knows that these indictments have absolutely nothing to with Trump and everything to do with making the investigation appear legitimate. Mueller probably has no intention of bringing those Russians to trial. Also, hackers and trolls are in no way evidence of collusion with Trump. Countries have an interest in other country‚Äôs election outcomes and have a favored candidate. Countries also meddle in other countries elections all the time. If a duly elected president was impeached because of this, then every president has been guilty. Some more things you‚Äôre not supposed to know:‚Ä¢	Do you think Trump‚Äôs decisions to rescind Obama‚Äôs environmental regulations issued by Executive Order and to renege on the Paris Agreement are an existential threat to life on Earth? Don‚Äôt lose too much sleep over it, the collective effect of Obama‚Äôs climate accomplishments would have an estimated effect on global temperature of 0.23ÀöF by the end of the CENTURY. Was it worth killing the coal industry and countless jobs? Why does anyone think government regulation can impact global temperature? ‚Ä¢	Does this indicate Trump is gearing up to drain the swamp? Time will tell. [https://www.theepochtimes.com/president-trump-declares-national-emergency-over-global-rights-abuses-and-corruption\_2393803.html](https://www.theepochtimes.com/president-trump-declares-national-emergency-over-global-rights-abuses-and-corruption_2393803.html)‚Ä¢	We all know how the media alerted us to Trump‚Äôs policy of separating families caught crossing the border and all the outrage and Nazi comparisons it invoked (even though family separation was also an Obama policy). They let us know how much they care about the children, but they are strangely silent on the global human trafficking problem (a $150 billion industry). The border plays a major role in this because of the amount of illegal activity made possible by trafficking across the border, and this is one of the reasons Trump is adamant about securing the border. Why the strange selectivity in what they‚Äôre outraged about?We‚Äôre walking away. Why is anyone surprised? nan nan We shouldn't punish the law abiding citizens because someone wants to be a criminal. In the Marines we would frequently get punished as a platoon to company to battalion if someone got a DUI because the commanders were trying to instill the "team" mentality. It didn't work, a ton of us were punished for the idiocy of the minority. I will never give up my right to bear arms. The Democrat party pushed too far and lost me forever. I also realized I get a long a lot better with right leaning people. Personal responsibility leads to a life that's full of success. Illegals will have to go back. I've seen illegals be treated as subhuman animals because they're here illegally and some people prey upon them. They have to go back where they came from, not only for our sake, but for their own sake as well.I was a liberal through high school and well into my university years post USMC. I will never return to that mentality because I am no longer a slave to the Democrat party. Hi, newish here. Mostly ever a lurker. Have a 'walkaway' story, but, don't find it compelling enough to tell. In regards to this title, however, I hope it's the right place to post it. I've been following r/politics for some time now and it seems that every news post posted lately is left-sided. And if the article that is posted isn't, the comments on it certainly are. Overwhelmingly so. The comments on almost all posts on r/politics fall right into the rhetoric that r/walkaway and right-leaning subreddits specifically hate. Irrational opinions about topics that are either completely fabricated or misunderstood. And I can't stand it. I really want to unfollow it to 'walk away' from the ignorance. Am I the only one that sees this? Or am I just subconsciously looking for it and finding it due to my political views? EDIT: Is there a subreddit that is a little less bias (to either side, but preferably leaning slightly right of center) that I can follow to get my 'news' "at a glance?" I've got sources for both sides, but, generally just like to look at stuff briefly on a subreddit before investigating it myself further.  nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan Lifelong Democrat here, and sorry in advance for the rant but I've got to say something and this really feels like the place. I was browsing r/all yesterday and came across a post from r/the-mueller that was something along the lines of "new GOP banner out, get your stickers printed today" and I just had it. If you haven't seen it, it depicted the GOP elephant with it's trunk up a woman's skirt, and the woman yelling for help.I don't know why this post bothered me so much. Maybe it was the disgusting content. Maybe it was the swarm of people laughing about how great it was and how they "can't wait to put the stickers on police cars", but I commented that I'd finally had it with the negativity and perversion. Every post on every left leaning sub is negative or vulgar. Every comment, every response, every private message I've gotten. It's all negative. People called me a fake Democrat, a troll, a Russian bot... And I'm just like, "guys wtf happened to this party?". Nothing I say could make them actually accept that I'm a real guy who has voted with them for a decade, every election since I became an adult. I basically bled blue and the one time I speak up about something that I think is wrong, every one of them immediately thinks "that's not a real person, that's a Russian bot". What the hell happened to this party? And you know what I think? I think they don't care. They don't give a crap that I'm fed up with it, and one of them jokingly linked this sub as a response. I hadn't heard of walkaway before, but I'm really glad there are people out there with some of the same perspectives I've had. After how I was treated over something so petty, I just have no faith in the party anymore. We should be trying to get as many people to vote blue as possible, not dismiss everyone with, "bye Felicia" if they aren't going to be as extreme. Republicans and conservatives just have a different energy in their posts. It isn't as vitriolic, it isn't as perverted in content, it honestly seems like they're having a good time with each other for the betterment of the nation and that just really resonates with me. I decided to walkaway and vote red this coming election because I want to be around people that make me feel good. I want to read content that makes me laugh, not stuff that makes me upset. I want to be part of something that includes as many people as possible, that tries to make this world better. That something just isn't the democratic party anymore. I'm just so fucking offended that after years of service and working with these guys, my friends!, they're just like, "see ya fake Democrat. Leave". I shouldn't be so upset but I can't help it. Spent my life with the party and they don't give a damn. I said one thing and all that work, all those votes and donations, nothing matters because only a bot or a Russian or a troll would say something.I'm gonna get off the internet for a bit and go for a run. What was the last straw for you guys? How did you find this sub?EDIT: You guys are amazing. Getting to hear everyone's stories was powerful and moving. Thank you for your insights, your experiences, and your passion. I had no idea this post would blow up like it did and I want to take the time to respond to as many of these as I can. Thanks for being you <3  nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan (link to the original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/9gn2eu/this\_post\_was\_deleted\_by\_rlgbt\_twice/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/9gn2eu/this_post_was_deleted_by_rlgbt_twice/) ) Note: this is not a brigade. I just want to point out some of the comments people are making for stating a general opinion. This is the problem in today's society. Blatant intolerance. "I am a gay conservative.I am tired of being generalized as a liberal (and other things) because of something as small as my sexual orientation. That is literally the tiniest detail of my life.I think LGBT culture is a good thing (Pride parades, drag, craziness). It is something that our previous generations needed to get by and something to escape to when society said "you are not one of us". If I was openly gay even ten years ago, life would be a lot more difficult. Life is still difficult for some of the LGBT community, especially the transgender community. We have made a lot of progress though. It is 2018 and as a gay man, I do not feel oppressed in society, and that is a privilege I appreciate to have in America while other countries behead people like me. What I dislike are political groups taking the LGBT community and using us as a platform to spread fear and ideologies assuming that we cannot think for ourselves.The things I want in life are simple. I want my Fiance and I to have a nice comfortable life, I want children one day, I want a house and maybe even open up a successful business. I won't go into specific details about my political opinions, but point being: I think for myself.I already expect to get backlash from this reddit page based off of a lot of posts I've seen here (hopefully I'm wrong), but I really think what I'm saying is important. Do I think other people need to have the same political and moral opinions as myself? Certainly not, but people need to think for themselves.Society tells us that we HAVE to support everything that is 'left'. I am gay so I need to be a democrat. We are an easy target. They use our insecurities and vulnerabilities to tell us that we need them. We don't need them. We are better and stronger than that.Before you decide to have an opinion on something, do ample research. Don't stick to regular news sources or Facebook. When I say this, I'm not assuming that you as the reader is not intelligent enough to do so, but for a while I was trapped into certain ways of thinking when I was in high school and in college. I always knew the left was "for gay marriage" so I always leaned towards that side, so naturally I adopted every other liberal policy as my own.It wasn't until I started researching specific issues myself (this was about a year ago) that I started putting together my own political opinions and I have to say I can breath a little easier knowing about specific issues and having my own opinion that CNN didn't give me (even if I happen to agree with what they say).I think nowadays, a lot of liberals are bigots. Yes, I used that word, usually used for right wing conservatives. It is defined as "a person who is intolerant toward those holding different opinions". and that is something that is very true. Whenever I express a opinion that isn't liberal (usually backed by statistics and data) its like my gay card is removed and I'm just some pile of horse sh\*t. Most media is liberal, and it is the more widely accepted political side.To sum this up: I am not a product, I am not a poster child for any political party or organization, I am a normal person and my sexual orientation does not define who I am as a person.In case anyone is interested, Brandon Straka, a member of the LGBT community, is the spokesperson for the #WalkAway movement. It is constantly growing and its really awesome to see others who feel the same way as I do. Here is the original video he posted: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51UGcghHZsk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51UGcghHZsk)"See the message from a moderator regarding my post being deleted:&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/jruvycj0q0n11.png?width=844&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a3807207be2d7e32864f57a5656a9508d214cae nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan You're only making things worse for your party.

So down vote me however much you want. But I'm not here to call you a bot, tell you your stupid, or troll. I have one very simple question.Where are you walking away to?I ask this because I agree with a lot the video talks about. Not all of it, but I do think he has some good points. I do believe the Democratic party has pushed away a lot of people in the center politically, and I do think they often have a desire to push drastic changes without taking the time to adiquately prepare and work towards those changes. I think some of our modern rhetoric is far too one sided and pushes an increasingly optimistic view of society/isn't realistic. So I have my issues with the party. I wasn't psyched about Clinton, though I voted for her. Neither was I a huge fan of Bernie, though again I still voted for him in the primary.But what will keep me from walking away is the question of where I would walk away to. I find the modern rhetoric and leadership of the Republican party morally corrupt. Their policies continue to favor the extremely wealthy over all else, I find their religion-based social positions disgusting (LGBT rights are huge to me, as is gender/racial equality) and their economic policies, while on the surface seem reasonable (balenced budget, fiscal responsibility, etc), in practice are only used to benefit them (cuts to the financial support structure to justify increased military spending, war on drugs, etc). As for third parties, none seem to have a serious platform or any staying power (admittedly mostly because of how the system operates, at least to an extent).So, I was wondering, to those who have walked away, or who are considering doing so, what is your alternative?I don't, and won't, make that decision. But I do want to understand better this 'movement.' nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan <https://twitter.com/i/moments/1033547403620757504>Tweets saved for the election. :)When you have a victim mentality, you gotta blame someone else.  nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan I‚Äôm not even kidding. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan I can't even watch it. Never in my life have I seen such a ridiculous farce be the left. It is behavior like this that caused me to walk away from the Democrats years ago. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan Once again they claim to be the party that will vilify men over an unsubstantiated claims from nearly 40 years ago without due process. To any normal person that isn't mentally retarded or a delusional far leftist, we've experienced life and realized the value and importance of things like 'evidence' or 'proof.' That really is the bottom line here, the Democratic party *actually* wants the course of our social structures between men and women to change, so that everything a woman says is taken on face value. It's truly elementary logic at it's finest.  nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan Hey guys, new here. I'm a registered Democrat but this thing red pilled me. It's like waking up from a trance and looking at all the former shows and news I enjoyed and watched and seeing it with a brand new eyes and hearing it for what it really is, a load of bull shit. I can see now how the MSM are full of one sided crap and an echo chamber, in which we were constantly repeating the leftist mantra of tolerance and freedom whilst acting the exact opposite. I used to see a conservative person as a backward gun toting hick with little to no education because that's what is being portrayed in the media and I just accepted it. The Dems overplayed this thing, trying to destroy a pretty decent guy for political gain, and the worst thing they could find about this guy is that he drank during high school and he threw an ice cube at a bar, including a barrage of accusations without and substance or evidence. This is what got me and I believe a lot more like me. That they can fuck a man's life, one who has stellar record and a family man, that easily. That guy is a GOOD guy, and look at the damage they've done. What do you think the narrative is going to be if Kavanaugh didn't go through, that they can destroy a good man's life just because it is to their benefit. What does that say to you and me whom I can argue with high confidence that has way way worse record than a supreme Court judge.All I can say is to forgive those protestors, they don't know what they are doing, they really don't. All the MSM and college campuses are almost entirely spouting liberal agenda. It is run by emotions, not facts, and we were taught that emotions are enough, that if we felt deep inside that we were wronged then that is right, facts be damned. I hope I'm not alone on this one, as this emotionally driven idiocy has to stop. I guess this is the time I #walkaway.Nice to meet you guys, glad to be finally here. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan My views never changed but team blue moved so far left, I ended up on the right.

I can admit it and I know this is a new account but the fact is that I am ashamed of my posts and actions against people who tried to educate me who I downvoted, insult, got banned even though they were right and I was wrong, etc.  I would have never even CONSIDERED that the walkaway movement was real because it made no sense to me why anyone would turn their back on "morality". I was not prepared for a smoking gun to "redpill" me ever in my life.Then I saw the links above, and several others like it. I had heard about this from a relative in California and dismissed it since she is a Trump supporter and assumed it was BS. Turns out it isn't. As a matter of fact, not only is it real as hell but the DNC refuses to allow any "whitelisted" news companies to report it so that word won't spread through liberal social media spaces. I was floored and flabbergasted. There is no way to spin this into something it isn't.It all makes total sense now, every single thing that has happened with the left's war on Trump while he continues to try and protect children from pedophiles ( https://www.google.com/amp/s/townhall.com/columnists/lizcrokin/2017/02/25/why-the-msm-is-ignoring-trumps-sex-trafficking-busts-n2290379%3famp=true ) and keep them in America where they are safe rather than send them back to impoverished conditions and unfit parents... I thought it was bullshit and propaganda but it all fits and is well documented. I can't unsee it and it has made me question all of my beliefs and values as a lifelong liberal and Democrat.I am officially walking away. I might even do a video since I know that people like me will see this and call me a russian bot, because I have done so in the past. I even trolled this sub and downvoted people just out of sheer boredom.

I‚Äôm done working overtime to defend my reputation for being a decent person. The fact is that I don‚Äôt have a single party I like or agree with more than a 50%. I don‚Äôt like mainstream feminism or practically any ‚Äúmen‚Äôs rights‚Äù groups. I don‚Äôt think capitalism is a perfect system, nor do I think socialism is.

Only the strength of a gorgeous man, a savior amongst human thieves and scoundrels, can bring us such majestic and doubtless intent.Make no mistake, disciples, we are witnessing the most beautiful, tearful, loving end of days.

As a pressure front beckoning the beginning of a new autumn of contentment and peace, our patriotic truth warriors shall find solace within and without the spire of his gorgeous empire.Now is the time to seek acceptance, my exemplary followers, for the coming days shall be not those of human likeness and planetary repetition, but instead something beyond that which was ever imagined of spiritual energy as the human souls, billions in all, are whisked away to a more fit, more righteous plane of existence with the assistance of our prophet and savior, Donald J.

It's been a really wild ride, and I had no idea there were thousands of you doing the same. &#x200B;For me personally, this was all set in motion by the Parkland shooting. As someone with experience in the military, a working knowledge of firearms, and I job in academic research, I saw the blatant mis-representation of the social science data we have surrounding guns. I saw the way it was tailored, picked, and pruned to fit a narrative. Seeing this occur on what I had considered to be "objective" new sources (NYT, ABC, NBC, CBS, Vox, etc) just left a splinter in my mind that I couldn't ignore.&#x200B;Eventually, I started to wonder "If they'll misrepresent this data to fit this narrative, what else are they manipulating" and the walls just started crumbling down. The gender pay gap, diversity/inclusion, minority oppression, the patriarchy, global politics, Trump, conservatives, etc etc etc. I went one by one and was able to now see the way I'd been misled and conditioned. I spent 7 years in higher education at a state university, and I do not believe that colleges are intentionally indoctrinating students into liberal ideology...but I do think they're doing it accidentally. The overwhelming liberal majority among professors and administrators is staggering, and I witnessed first hand how that bleeds into the zeitgeist of opinion on campus. I believe that many, if not most, academics try to prevent their own biases and political views from influencing their students. They try to choose their words carefully, but they simply can't escape their worldview. These authority figures unknowingly present a paradigm that young, malleable brains absorb and internalize. Sprinkle in a few far leftist activist professors who think it's their job to organize protests and the like, and you have a liberal supermajority forming among students. &#x200B;I'm honestly embarrassed at the way I treated some of the conservatives in my life in previous years (my family mostly). I jumped to the worst conclusions about them when we disagreed on political issues, I assumed their ignorance, or I thought they were being indoctrinated by Fox News. Little did I know that they were much wiser that I, and I am thankful that they were patient and loving enough to absorb my disdain and keep coming back for more. As a part of my political evolution, these wounds have been healed and I'm grateful for that.  &#x200B;It feels good to call myself a conservative. It felt very foreign for some time, but today I can say that I am proud of my ability to resist groupthink and group identity. I have my values and political opinions as a result of deliberate, thoughtful investigation, rather than by default(following family or peers), and that carries me through the storms of criticism (of which there have been many by my peers). The way that seemingly intelligent people have turned on me and my views in such hateful and disrespectful ways is more telling than anything else. The "Tolerant" left, exposing themselves for who they really are...tolerant of those who agree with them and intolerant of everyone else. I will proudly walk away from such a group. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan Are they thinking this really helps their cause? nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan They're downvoting an entire sub's content into the 40-50% range while accusing anyone who criticizes the Dems of being liars and even Russian bots...because they can't believe people would want to get away from them.

If you are reading this, most likely you are a past liberal fed up with the direction they've been going; still a liberal curious about this whole thing; or a conservative that has been witnessing the demise of the left.    Whatever your reason, there are a few things you should know.   You don't have to like Trump. You don't have to write MAGA after every comment. You could even despise the man. Unlike many places these days, you don't have to agree with everything just to be accepted.   We accept all sorts of people coming to us with the same reason: the left no longer aligns with our beliefs or morals.    This is a place for us to come together and converse without being ousted or labeled some sort of "-ist" or "-phobic" just because of a willingness to think or discuss.    We appreciate all of your making this movement possible, and I truly hope this community helps you find peace and happiness as I know it has for me.   Much love, new family. nan nan nan nan Reddit deleting and censoring. Following in the footsteps of FB & Twitter. I see going before Congress in their future. Will they lie like Zuckerberg & Jack?  Goodbye Reddit. RIP. The guy had charisma I bought into his "take down the billionaire class" spiel.  I did not consider myself republican or democrat before 2016-  I was registered independent.  I could see how shit Obama was for our country- and Hillary was 10x worse.  When I saw all the corruption and rigging of the primaries, and then to see Sanders just roll over and endorse Hillary- that was it for me.I always saw Republicans as just "angry old men" like my Dad.  And i honestly dont know why... I was afraid of confrontation and sucked into TYT back then.  But I really woke up when TYT endorsed Hillary- it was a big joke.  I never knew how brainwashed I was by leftist media... its scary looking back honestly. But, I did think Trump was hilarious the whole primary.  He was shitting on everyone and I secretly loved it.  But then he would show grace when people bowed out of the primaries.  Idk what exactly it was that got me to support Trump,  but the man is a god damn genius... he really is.  The past 2 years have been absolutely incredible and I thank God every day that Trump won.  My only regret is voting Jill Stein (LOL) which I will NOT be repeating!!!  I have been on the Trump train now since his first month in office. God bless Donald Trump! nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan Prior to the last election I had no problem knowing what I believed.  I was against military, war, guns, right to lifers, organized religion, country music, rednecks, God the list could go on and on.  So I won't go into my "transition".  You who went thru it understand.  I describe it as having my belief system being turned inside-out.  But what's bothering me is the guilt over how fucking WRONG I was for my whole life.  I'm old now, my parents have both died and I have grown children.  It kills me to remember the hurt look in my dad's eyes, and way Mom would sigh and shake her head at my attitudes.  Dad fought in WW2 for 4 stinking years, seeing his family one time during this period.  And yet I disrespected his service in my heart.  I disrespected my country, my family, many many friends and acquaintances.  Not verbally but in my heart and beliefs. I was a terrible person.  I almost cried yesterday thinking about this.  I knew in my heart for years that my beliefs weren't holding up very well to my own scrutiny. I was too fucking stubborn to admit I was wrong to myself let alone those I love/loved.  I truly pray I will be much more careful with my beliefs in the future, but this guilt from past actions really brings me down. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan I was a registered democrat until a few months ago, I guess they still have my number...With every question they asked, I could tell the surveyor was getting more and more aggravated with me. It was questions like:>"Do you think that the Democratic Party represents the common man?"I said "hell no", but  I wish I said "Did you just assume my gender?">"What do you think of Trump's Tax Plan"I love it.>"What do you think of Trump's support for the NRA?"Its awesome that he cares about self defense rights for us.. We can't all afford   bodyguards like Hillary. >" Sigh...Who do you plan on voting for in the 2020 election". Trump. Hands down. I've walked away from the democratic party after voting for Obama twice and voting democrat for my entire life.Every question she was getting more and more agitated with me and by the end she was sighing at the end of each question.

I am a Russian Troll who is paid 300 Russian Ruples a day to ensure that Republicans stay in power!  I was personally indicted by Robert Mueller, and received an award from Father Putin and Comrade Trump himself during his recent visit, a signed bottle of Putinka!  Father Putin has instructed the moderators here to not censor any questions, since we are trying to distance ourselves from our competitors, Share Blue and Onward Together, and be more transparent.  AMA!   —Ä–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å :  That is all for now!  Father Putin has sent a message saying I am reaching my 55mb of fun time data.  I must go for now and get back to campaigning for the Republicans.  Father Putin, as kind as he is, wants me to let you all know that he will soon allow The Russian Hacker responsible for hacking into the election ballots and switching millions of votes for Hillary to Comrade Trump, to do an AMA soon.  You all may know him as Guccifer 2.0.  Thanks Comrades!  And remember to vote Republicans! G'Ma has learned a powerful lesson & I feel kind of stupid because I know better. For the 1st time in my life I have experienced on a personal level the of unhinged hate the liberals have a visceral need to spew. I allowed myself to be sucked in to their sick world by responding to their insults of you, me & your movement. By doing that I bowed to their level & gave them my power. After all their motivation is to disrupt & they do it by making you angry. Hurting you makes them happy. To engage them is an exercise in futility. Common sense has taken a leave of absence where liberals are concerned.  I found myself getting very angry & I'm too old for that shit. So I'm going to do what G'Ma has always done. Ignore people who want nothing more than to hurt & derail forward movement. Have you really looked at them lately?  Always angry. So what if they say we're bots, paid Republicans, uneducated poor people, Nazi's ,Bigots, racists, or all the "Phobes etc. Just their hateful harassment validates why you are part of the walkaway movement. I will be here as a HUGE fan pouring out admiration instead. So keep on with your Badass selves. You are being true to yourselves & that is powerful no matter what they throw at you. Luv & Big Hugs. G'MaP.S. Now that I have said that I won't engage, the haters will work overtime to try & bait me. Just remember, when you are over the target you catch the most flack. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan I started off my **freshmen year** of high school as a **liberal** and I left as a **conservative**, I am now the only conservative member in a family (though no one in my family knows because I do not want to become the black sheep of the family) in a liberal state in a liberal school. I used to think all **Republicans were old white men that hated minorities** (people like me). That's what I had been told all my life, but that all changed when after the parkland shooting and the teacher spoke about how we should ban guns (AR-15 and other rifles) I told questioned her on it and she told me to do research on guns and so I went down the conservative rabbit hole. I watched Steven Crowder's Pro gun change my mind, Ben Shapiro debating on various topics and such. After a while I went on to debate my fellow classmates and this is when I **realized** just how **toxic** the left has become. I got threatened to get **beat up by one of classmates** for voicing my views, called a **white sympathizer** for being republican and even a **teacher threatening to send me to the deans** for stating I had no problems with guns. The climate in my high school is toxic and non welcoming to conservatives which would explain why other republicans in my school don't speak out, the crowd mentality and the victimization is why I left, and why I don't plan on coming back. Thank you #WalkAwayEdit: Spelling nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan So I get a lot of flak from both my right-leaning friends and leftists I argue with, about my theory that Hillary Clinton is going to run again.  Well, I think we may have kind of a teaser announcement in this article I will post at the bottom of this post.  She spoke at an event known as, Lesbians Who Tech Summit.  With a typical SJW sychophant interviewing her while drooling at her every comma, Hillary answered questions about what is in her Netflix watch list and fascist proposals such as nationalizing social media.  Pay attention to the messaging here, it is as if she is a couple of months from a presidential election, running with the SAME MESSAGE!  Same fucking message!  And being asked these rapid-fire questions is just a way to psychologically sweep away any recollections of her poor health as we all remember.Here are the question and answer from the Queen that I am referring too...SJW Sycophant- ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that one thing that, if it happened, you would know your work is done? For me, it‚Äôs having a black lesbian president. For you, what is your moonshot?‚ÄùQueen of Antifa- ‚ÄúWow, well can I have two moonshots?‚ÄùSJW Sycophant- ‚ÄúYou can have whatever you want.‚ÄùQueen of Antifa- ‚ÄúObviously one of them is having a woman president, which I think would make such a difference. And the other is once and for all getting to universal healthcare coverage that covers everything. So you know, I‚Äôm going to keep trying to make the first one happen, and keep working to make the second happen eventually.‚ÄùNow does that sound like someone who is going to sit this next one out?  To me, it sounds like someone who really wants to be the first female president, and to her credit, someone who isn't going to give up that dream.  What the hell do I know, though?  I am just a dumb Redhat from the South.[Source](https://qz.com/1391033/hillary-clinton-on-pantsuits-birkenstocks-and-bitcoin/?utm_source=reddit.com) nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan _This body intentionally left blank._ nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan It‚Äôs how you know we‚Äôre winning.  nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4200272/92-Berlin-left-wing-activists-live-parents.html?fbclid=IwAR0xw6RzAJnJN7Vzwp2W4aSj5ChXtAkxkWdL6yN57s7uQU1u8479x6CSrNY nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan So I was on Tim Pool youtube page and I saw this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL54ib4-fJA. The video talks about why men are refusing to work with women in the metoo era. The biggest reason given was that many man where scared that a compliment would lead to them being accussed of sexual harassment. This a long with the hypocrisies of Rose Mcowan and Asia argento have turned some people off to metoo. So has the metoo movement kind of cooled off? nan Walked away after the primaries were rigged. I've always aligned myself with democratic ideals, it just took me multiple elections to realize a) They don't actually intend to implement these policiesb) Their only talking points are identity politics and attempts to make x group hate x group for x reasonsI want it to be known, I don't think Bernie Sanders is a bad guy, or a bad politician. I think he was misled by a profoundly corrupt DNC who sold itself to the Clinton family long ago. I think the democratic party promises utopian ideals it doesn't deliver. I don't consider myself a republican, I just consider myself no longer a democrat. I don't intend to ever return to the party, it's clear corruption has taken hold of it at the highest level. I will likely be voting independent from here on out. nan nan I went from:Voting for Obama twiceBernie sign in my yard, canvassing in my countyWatching fellow Dems make excuses for protestors blocking highway on-ramps. Watching fellow Dems make excuses for HillaryArguing with people on the_donald and getting bannedListening to Thomas Sowell, Joe Rogen, Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson. Watching Dems condone the violence of Antifa and not giving a shit about free speech. Now I am going to be more than happy to vote for Trump in 2020.  I have walked away to  become something like a Conservative Libertarian I‚Äôm not a Republican, but I am certainly not a Dem anymore.  nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan For me it was a bit of a process. I was a major SJW, I know all the facts! I had taken so many sociology classes and had written so many great papers for college, whew! I was the shit! I started taking basic economics, macro and micro, for the purpose of proving those evil right wingers wrong (I had sjw Econ professors.) But one day, in my macro textbook I read some interesting facts. It wasn‚Äôt a biased fact, it was simply a fact about some numbers. I‚Äôm not sure what exactly is said now, this was like 6 or more years ago (only in the past year have I left the left). Basically the book stated something about businesses and government lobbying. Businesses did x percentage of government lobbying. I was like ‚Äúaha! The evil capitalists! They control the government with their lobbying!‚Äù And so I went digging. I learned that businesses would lobby the government for environmental regulations, or safety regulations, or who knows what. Why would they do that? They cut out their own money to have these regulations. What I soon found out was that these regulations cut out their competition. That once a corporation was large enough, it could lobby the government, and create a situation where any startup competitor would never be able to start a business due to huge price floors, such as having to meet a safety standard that costs insane amounts of money not only to meet, but to pay the government to even get a license.My mind wasn‚Äôt changed yet but I was curious. These evil corporations were controlling the government, I always knew that as an sjw. I knew the evil capitalists were always plotting. And so I went on with school, taking as much sociology as I could (without it being a major because I loved physics).I started doing research on socialism and communism. I thought the world needed a revolution. And I was set on proving those people who believe in capitalism wrong.In my mind, inequality was the result of racism. Why would black and Hispanic people live at double the rate per percentage of their population than white people? What explanation was there for it? Either the system was systematically racist (the truth in my eyes) or you believed it was due to genetics and thus you were a racist. All of my sociology learning confirmed it was racism. All of my socialism and communism research confirmed it was the evil capitalists, and some racism. Why didn‚Äôt capitalists understand that the system was rigged for non whites? They must be racist, they must really believe that blacks and Hispanics are inferior to whites! Those sick fucks!And so I was on a mission to learn all I could. I started to learn more about economics but always from the left perspective.Then one day I came across a video that said ‚Äúwhy the minimum wage is bad‚Äù with Peter Schiff. I scoffed as I always did ‚Äúthis will be another bunch of racist trash‚Äù I used to watch right wing videos and wait till I heard some racist shit, and I‚Äôd say ‚Äútypical‚Äù and shut it off. I didn‚Äôt need to hear any more.But Peter Schiff, he didn‚Äôt trigger my racist button that the left installed in me. So I ended up watching the whole video. He showed how just like with corporate lobbying to destroy competition, that government interference and regulations helped to hurt the very people it was supposed to help. The people I cared about the most, the poor, were being hurt by a whole myriad of of government legislation. He explained it in a way that I was actually able to open up my eyes and mind to. That day all of the little things I had learned here and there all came together and boom, I was enlightened. My perspective was forever changed.I adopted an entrepreneurial mindset. I had been watching my favorite youtubers working hard, making videos, selling t-shirts. Offering life advice like ‚Äúwork hard and your dreams can come true too!‚Äù I never really understood exactly how it was possible, at least not without government help. Until I saw that Peter schiff video. Suddenly I saw that yes, I could create my own life. I could work hard and follow my passions and help people and make money and make a great life for myself. I didn‚Äôt have to wallow in despair at how the system is rigged against poor people and there‚Äôs no way out! No, that‚Äôs idiotic. Any person can conquer poverty. It‚Äôs all in your mindset. Every individual can make something of their life. The government doesn‚Äôt save us poor people. It hurts us. It removes our ability to create our own life. It puts regulations in the way and justifies them because we really believe all people are inherently evil and just searching to make a quick buck at the expense of the lives of other people. It‚Äôs a sick mentality and while in some cases it‚Äôs true, government intervention in the economy only exacerbates this part of human nature. Now here I am, taking my perspective now and comparing it as much as I can to my former views. Reading what leftists have to say, socialist and all that. Now I can really dig as deep as I want into their views and it only seems to solidify what I‚Äôve learned. I can see their ignorance so clearly but it‚Äôs impossible to show them my new perspective. It‚Äôs all about perspective. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with inequality. There‚Äôs something seriously sick and twisted about telling people they are hopeless in this world. Telling women and minorities that they can‚Äôt do it without government help because the evil white men are working hard to keep them down! Yea they are, it‚Äôs YOU, you leftists with your self defeating messages. Leftists destroy the hearts and minds of people. They remove our free will and make us believe everything is determined from birth. It‚Äôs an insidious disease one that the leftists just don‚Äôt understand. They don‚Äôt see how their views degrade the hearts and minds and free will and happiness of the people.Then I found Jordan Peterson and he confirms all of this. But to them, he‚Äôs telling lies and misconstrued the facts. But see, he‚Äôs right. The left is a foul disease robbing humanity of their free will.Now I‚Äôm on the Ayn Rand train. Objectivism is an amazing thing. It‚Äôs the most positive inspiring ideology I‚Äôve ever learned about. But if you‚Äôre a leftist it‚Äôs pure evil.Perspective is funny. No amount of facts and statistics seem able to change a perspective. It‚Äôs a bit of willingness to open your mind and a bit of a slow process to get the ball rolling. And once you finally wake up, it doesn‚Äôt hurt. It feels good. It feels good to continuously orient yourself towards the truth, for the truth shall set you free.  nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan This might actually be a bit late, as the school year has started or is starting for a lot of college students, but it needs to be said anyway. Let's open up with a very simple thought experiment:Alice intends to develop the next wave of powerful therapies, with an eye towards anti-cancer, rejuvenative biotechnology, and similar research areas. She's taking introductory biology courses for her first year but intends to get into the harder stuff ASAP.Bob is taking pre-med courses and fully intends to be a front-line medical practitioner. He's not sure if he wants to specialize or just become a family doctor, but he knows that he wants to be Bob, MD.Charlie believes that he, personally, will be the one to make nuclear fusion work. He's taking physics and engineering courses to accomplish this, and he'd like to intern at Lockheed-Martin as soon as he can.Deborah intends to be an electrical engineer and is taking courses to match, developing smart household devices that reduce the amount of electricity consumed. She strongly believes that people with old, inefficient equipment need to be able to afford replacements.Edgar is taking English, philosophy, art history, and one course titled "The Intersectionality of Harry Potter". He intends to have a master's degree in gender studies. He sees himself as socially "woke" and wants to either join Greenpeace or be a Title IX administrator - he's not sure which.You all see where I'm going with this. We can argue whether Alice or Bob is going to save more lives in the long run (we clearly need both), and we can debate whether Charlie is going to get anywhere doing what he's doing or if Deborah's incremental approach will cause less fossil fuel to be burned. But Edgar isn't even in the running. He's not saving lives. He's not going to prevent discrimination or stop fossil fuel companies or whatever. He's not helping the world. His degree is going to be in screeching. His daily life is also likely taken up by screeching. No matter how many Twitter or Reddit posts he makes about Russia or Trump or whatever, he has not helped a single person of any color or creed, not even himself.So, my message to first-year college students is this:Walk away, right now, before you end up like Edgar. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan I was born to an African-American father and White Canadian mother. My parents were textbook hippies in the 70s. I was raised in Canada after they divorced. I dealt with a lot of racism and abuse and made the decision to emigrate to the United States at 18, where I've been ever since. Even though my experience with racism as a Canadian soured me on the country, I was a committed socialist, like many Canadians. You're kind of raised with it. I also had a disdain for Americans - you're kind of raised with that too. But I came to the U.S. for a better life, despite my negative attitude toward Americans. Like most black people I was simply a default Democrat. I didn't know any Republicans or conservatives who looked like me...and why would I? They're all racists. I'd grown up hearing that Republicans wanted to bring back slavery and conservatives hated women, blacks and SEX! I believed the rich were fleecing the poor and I had a deep resentment towards my privileged white peers. I felt very strongly that most of America's problems were the result of racism and an unequal distribution of wealth. Despite my socialist beliefs, I actually worked hard to put myself through school and earn enough money to move around the country having different experiences. When I married my husband I moved into his home in Gary, IN. Before that time I'd lived in the "ghetto" but never was really a part of the culture. I could leave when I wanted, move on to other things when I wanted, etc. etc. I guess you could say I was "privileged". But in Gary, I suddenly became a PART of the neighborhood and I quickly set about putting down roots. My husband's father was a local and well-respected pastor. Together we opened an after-school program for inner city youth. Gary is about 87% black, so our hearts were directed to serve our population in the education arena. My FIL was the first black man I'd ever met who proudly called himself a "conservative" and a Republican. I was perplexed. We would often argue about things like socialism vs. capitalism, racism and inequality. He gently but intelligently challenged my notions of economics and prosperity. At the same time, here I was working every day with kids from an underprivileged, underserved population and watching how their struggles were so different day-to-day than kids in other areas. And I got to see how all the policies I supported my entire life actually worked and I realized...they didn't. I started to realize that maybe my thinking on what "help" really is might be more based in theory than real-world experience. One day I was having a conversation with a group of 5th graders about saving for their future and I realized - how can I sit here and out of one side of my mouth tell them the White American "MAN" will always keep them down and the odds are stacked against them and they'll alway be victims while out of the other side of my mouth trying to inspire them to reach for the stars and telling them they can be whatever they want and they don't have to feel trapped in their circumstances. That was the moment I decided to #WalkAway. I knew the rhetoric I'd been absorbing and regurgitating all these years wasn't just ill-informed, it was dangerous. It was keeping good people from recognizing that their less-than-ideal circumstances could actually be a springboard to hard work and success. That was a little over a decade ago. I don't like to call myself a Republican, but I'm conservative with libertarian leanings and I truly believe that America doesn't necessarily OWE us opportunity, America IS the opportunity. We don't all start off on equal footing, but just being here puts us 5 steps ahead of everyone else in the world. I feel strongly that is a message of empowerment for black Americans and I want to see my community thrive using the values and principles of free enterprise and God-given rights. nan nan nan  Here‚Äôs one of the major reasons the democrats are for weak borders, and sanctuary cities. It all comes down to the numbers. As it stands, every 10 years the census happens, and that count of population determines the distribution of seats in congress and the house of representatives. The census counts population, but doesn‚Äôt consider citizenship, and this is why the democrats are against the question to ask of citizenship on the census. This manipulates the count in order to receive larger federal funding, and more seats in government."Impact On Congressional ApportionmentNon-citizens Have Large Impact. Immigration has a significant effect on the distribution of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives for three reasons. First, seats are apportioned based on each state's total population relative to the rest of the country, including illegal aliens and other non-citizens. This, of course, is the issue at the center of Congresswomen Miller's proposal. Second, congress has chosen to allow in a large number of legal immigrants and to tolerate wide spread illegal immigration. After the 2000 Census, the average congressional district had roughly 650,000 people. Thus, the more than 18 million non-citizens in the 2000 Census were equal to nearly 29 congressional seats. The third reason is that non-citizens are not evenly distributed throughout the country. In 2000, half of all non-citizens lived in just three states and almost 70 percent live in just six states. States with a large non-citizen population will gain at the expense of states comprised mostly of citizens.Impact of Non-Citizens on Apportionment. In a report entitled, "Remaking the Political Landscape: The Impact of Illegal and Legal Immigration on Congressional Apportionment," published by the Center for Immigration Studies in October of 2003, we calculated the impact of non-citizens on the distribution of seats in the House.5 Overall we found that the presence of non-citizens caused a total of nine seats to change hands. Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin each lost a seat that they had prior to the 2000 Census while Montana, Kentucky and Utah each failed to gain a seat they other wise would have gained, but for the presences non-citizens in other states. Of the nine seats redistributed by non-citizens, 6 went to California, while Texas, New York and Florida each gained a seat and New York retained a seat it otherwise would have lost. Analysis of this kind is very straightforward, involving a simple calculation of the apportionment of seats to states with non-citizens included and then without them. Other researchers have come to the same conclusion.6Impact of Illegal Aliens. In our 2003 apportionment study we also tried to estimate the impact of illegal aliens by themselves. The former INS has estimated the size and state distribution of illegals who responded to the Census, and we used those figures to estimate their impact on the distribution of House seats. We found that of the nine states that lost seats due to non-citizens, four were the result of illegals. This makes perfect sense because 40 to 45 percent of non-citizens are illegal aliens. Indiana, Michigan, and Mississippi each lost one seat in the House and Montana failed to gain a seat it otherwise would have gained because of illegal aliens in other states.Impact on Electoral College. Immigration and the resulting non-citizen population not only redistributes seats in the House, it has the same effect on presidential elections because the apportionment of the Electoral College is based on the same basic calculations as congressional delegations. Thus immigration policy and the resulting large non-citizen population it produces impacts the distribution of political influence both in Congress and in the Executive.States That Lost Did Not Decline in Population. One common mistake is to think of the states that lost seats as losing population. It is very important to understand that the states that lost a seat due to the presence of non-citizens in other states are not declining in population. The population of the four states that lost seats due to illegals increased 1.6 million in the 1990s, and the population of the five states that lost a seat because of other non-citizens increased 2 million. However, immigration caused the population of other states to grow even faster."full article with video to change the law to count only citizens for seats of representation[https://cis.org/Impact-NonCitizens-Congressional-Apportionment](https://cis.org/Impact-NonCitizens-Congressional-Apportionment) nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan I‚Äôll try and make this short and sweet. I grew up in the Northern suburbs of Illinois, and for as long as I love this place has been a heavily concentrated hub for ~~socialists~~ Democrats, with my brother being one of many people who adopted their twisted ideologies. Growing up, I was never really heavily informed about politics. I usually went off of what I heard and joined the masses in my area, not entirely sure why I was saying what I was saying. My parents never really tried to influence me politically, and I can‚Äôt thank them enough for that, but the mobs still spoke out and I followed suit. For a while there I lived in ignorance, but eventually I started researching politics. More and more I felt myself drift away from the party I became so aquatinted with, until eventually the nail in the coffin hit when I found Ben Shapiro. I loved watching him and found myself agreeing with more and more of his ideologies as I researched them. I kept learning more facts about more political issues, and that knowledge permanently severed me from the Democrats. I realized that I was living a lie for so long, ignoring the truth when I thought I already knew it. Becoming a Republican was an incredible decision on my part, and I only wish I did it sooner.   nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan I could write a literal novel on the reasons I'm no longer a democrat. I realized Obama was a placebo president for black voters. I realized HRC is a power hungry, corporate puppet who feels like she is OWED the white house. I realized that 'free shit' is not really free because somebody is paying the bill (that would be ALL of us). Also, 'free shit' tends to go down in value and effectiveness when ran by the government. I realized the equality fight is teetering on discrimination in some regards (especially with the new age feminist movement). I realized that having a difference of opinion about certain social topics was not tolerated. I realized that the position on guns and regulation is completely dishonest, misguided and bullheadedly stubborn. I realized that democrats are literally willing to set fire to democracy simply because their candidate didn't win. I realized that the left is willing to destroy anybody who attempts to have civil discourse with the right (kanye, steve harvey, kim k, omarosa, etc.). I realized that the left wants the government to be it's nanny and accept no responsibility or accountability for themselves but will piss and moan every time the gov't falls short on their 'duty'. But what really made me realized I was no longer a democrat was the fact that other people came to these realizations as well, voiced their concerns and the party doubled down in their ignorance and flaws in response. How is that 'progressive' or 'inclusive'?I think HRC would make a terrible president. I condone having discussions with people you disagree with. ESPECIALLY if they are the ones running your country. I'm not in favor of 'free shit'. I'm in favor of 'more affordable' shit. Find a way to bring the prices down (ie. stop jerking off corporations and let the free market do it's thing), don't make everybody pay the high bill. I'm not in favor of open borders. I'm not in favor of prison reform because people in prison did something to be put there. <~~~ all of that used to be considered a fairly democratic point of view about 10 years ago. Not anymore. As of 2016, I'm also against further gun control. Instead, I think the money funneled into anti-gun lobbying should be diverted to underfunded schools and job creation in urban areas to decrease ALL violent crime in high crime areas. But David Hogg is Christ reincarnated to the left so... *shrug*... I guess I won't be registering as a Dem again for a long time. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan I don't have a tv or cable. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan Do you think Trump can actually win the Republican nomination for president?

I'm just curious as to the the general opinion on this sub. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan some of you may have seen the old version of this on other subs...I‚Äôve Been promising to update and revise this for a LONG time... and include sources for the numbers....So here she is.Do with it what you will:‚Äî-**The ACTUAL facts about gun violence in America**There are about 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, this number is not disputed. (1) U.S. population 328 million as of January 2018.  (2)Do the math: 0.00915% of the population dies from gun related actions each year. Statistically speaking, this is insignificant. It's not even a rounding error.What is not insignificant, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths:‚Ä¢ 22,938 (76%) are by suicide which can't be prevented by gun laws (3)‚Ä¢ 987 (3%) are by law enforcement, thus not relevant to Gun Control discussion. (4)‚Ä¢ 489 (2%) are accidental (5)So no, "gun violence" isn't 30,000 annually, but rather 5,577... 0.0017% of the population.Still too many? Let's look at location:* 298 (5%) - St Louis, MO (6)* 327 (6%) - Detroit, MI (6)* 328 (6%) - Baltimore, MD (6)* 764 (14%) - Chicago, IL (6)That's over 30% of all gun crime. In just 4 cities.This leaves 3,856 for for everywhere else in America... about 77 deaths per state. Obviously some States have higher rates than othersYes, 5,577 is absolutely horrific, but let's think for a minute...But what about other deaths each year?* 70,000+ die from a drug overdose (7)* 49,000 people die per year from the flu (8)* 37,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities (9)Now it gets interesting:* 250,000+ people die each year from preventable medical errors. (10)You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital!* 610,000 people die per year from heart disease (11)Even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save about twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.). A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides.Simple, easily preventable, 10% reductions!We don't have a gun problem... We have a political agenda and media sensationalism problem.‚Äî‚Äîsources‚Äî‚Äî1. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_02.pdf2. https://everytownresearch.org/firearm-suicide/3. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhamcs/web_tables/2015_ed_web_tables.pdf4. https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings-2017/?tid=a_inl_manual5. https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-accidental-gun-deaths-20180101-story.html6. https://247wallst.com/special-report/2018/11/13/cities-with-the-most-gun-violence/ (stats halved as reported statistics cover 2 years, single year statistics not found)7. https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates8. https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/faq.htm9. https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/81260310. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2018/02/22/medical-errors-third-leading-cause-of-death-in-america.html11. https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan EDIT: OK, the title was incorrectI called myself a liberal. That is true, but I guess I should correct that to "somewhat left of centre, but not very far out". I guess I should just stick with "these are my ideas. I have agreed with the Liberal party of Canada for most of my life, hence I call myself a liberal".   I made this post because, as much as I disagree with the conservative ideology, I don't hate conservative people. And I want to show that the perception that no liberal can maintain a civilized ideological disagreement while not bashing the people who disagree with them is wrong. I do not mean to force my views on you.1) I want to apologize for the SJWs. I disagree with their ideology entirely, and hope to keep it out of the Canadian government.2) I do still disagree with many conservative points, but I don't hate conservatives as people. So this post doesn't mean that I am now a conservative - rather, it means that I am disillusioned with what "liberal" means today.3) I hope that, even though we disagree on many topics, we can come together as a common people. I will not lie - I had initially hoped for a Hillary presidency. As time went on, however, I decided that I liked neither candidate. But I am going to wait and see what Trump does, instead of immediately denouncing him.What I am for---------------1) Equal rights for all, regardless of skin colour, race, religion, etc.2) Freedom of speech. Even speech which I don't like.3) Peaceful protest.4) Freedom of religion. But subject to restrictions to maintain human rights. Eg. I don't care if you choose to wear a cross or a bindi or a yamuka or etc. out of choice, because of your religion. But I don't think that any religion's values should be forced on nonbelievers.What I am against--------------------1) Division into groups. Everyone should have equal rights. And while I think everyone should be able to be proud of their heritage, I think that, as with many other things, there is an acceptable limit. I.e., you shouldn't go around saying you are better than everyone else because of your heritage.2) Separation and echo chambers. I have to admit, I was guilty of this. I am now trying to make amends. I think that this has happened on both sides. 3) Forcing your views on others.I don't know what "liberal" and "conservative" will mean in the future. I just want to apologize for SJWs and say that, even though we may disagree ideologically, I hope that we can work together in the future.I understand that you will disagree with some, or even all, of what I said. I think that's fine. Disagreement is healthy for discourse, and as long as it remains civil, I have no problem with it.I apologize if this comes across as posting in a sub where I shouldn't post. But I wanted to step out of the echo chamber.EDIT: Some rebuttals: 1) No, I am not and never will be a conservative. I don't mind conservative people, but I am not a conservative. I am for a fully secular government, I want more liberal economic policies such as stimulus packages, etc. 2) I do not mean to say that I disagree with all of the left. I was concerned that the protestors would make me look bad. I simply wanted to point out that I do not condone violence. Peaceful protest is perfectly acceptable. 3) As my friends have pointed out to me, the electoral college exists for a reason. While I am sad that Hillary lost (although TBH, even though I preferred her to Trump, I was beginning to be unsure), I don't want to get involved in contesting a presidential victory. 4) I do not want a fully liberal or a fully conservative government. I want a coalition or a centrist government, to prevent extremists on either side from setting policy. 5) I acknowledge that by listening to only a few news sources, I was not being open minded. But I think that people on both sides were doing this. 6) I support choice. I want people to have the freedom to do whatever they want, with reasonable limits. You and I disagree on the definiton of "reasonable", as shown by some comments below. This includes abortion. Disagreement is fine, but I strongly value this. 7) As others have pointed out, I cannot claim to speak for all liberals. That was a mistake.So no, I am not, and will never will be a conservative. I know that many of you will disagree with this, which as I said earlier, is perfectly fine. That was the main point of this post, one that got lost among my inept writing.  nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan **Here's a link to the video:** [https://youtu.be/8IIm2an8QkI](https://youtu.be/8IIm2an8QkI)My partner and I do Policy Debate and recently competed in the Arizona State Invitational debate tournament. The debate topic was "Resolved: The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce restrictions on legal immigration"In policy debate, the affirmative proposes a plan which falls under the resolution, and the negative rejects it. For example, many affirmatives remove the per-country limits on immigration. My partner and I were assigned the negative position, but our opponents did not read a plan. Instead, they performed a slam poem about citizenship and dehumanization.In response, we argued that they weren't actually an affirmative because they did not advocate a plan for the resolution, and that their strategy was unfair to negative positions.They then argued we could not talk about fairness because we were white males and had "caucasity".In response, we read a critique against identity politics utilizing quotes from Sam Harris, Ben Shapiro, and Jordan Peterson. We argue that our identity as white males shouldn't matter in the round; that our race and gender have nothing to do with what's right and wrong; That we should instead regard people as individuals. The judge then ends the round and disqualifies for making "racist and violent" arguments endorsed by "white supremacists."The debate space is a leftist echo chamber and it must be exposed. I first attempted to bring this to light on [r/debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/debate), but was met with an overwhelmingly negative response, and the post was eventually removed by the moderators. Hard to imagine a better way for them to prove my point.

I‚Äôve had it with the news, I‚Äôve had it with Instagram, I‚Äôve had it with reddit.I never wanted to declare allegiance with a political party because I see flaws with both sides. But this whole Greta Thunberg has skyrocketed me to be a trump supporter. I mean look at the fucking media... it is so absolutely fucking biased that I want to pull my hair out. Oh so it‚Äôs okay for democrats to make fun of a 16 year old male with a MAGA hat who was PROVEN TO HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG but yet the democrats demonizes everyone who does the same with Greta? What the fuck!And other thing that pissed me off. I live in El Paso, the second most crossing of illegal immigrants. Here‚Äôs a situation I see all the time: - illegal crosses the border and buys a cheap car with no insurance.- gets into a car wreck with someone who has insurance- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other person‚Äôs pocketAnd every time I talk about this subject online I get compared to a nazi saying ‚ÄúVare Are Yor Paperz!!!!‚Äù How is that even comparable? I care for people and I want everyone to be here, but it creates problems for everyone when people don‚Äôt follow the rules. ____________________________________________I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they aren‚Äôt getting funded. And I‚Äôm not going to lie, I don‚Äôt know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they aren‚Äôt!____________________________________________And are we going to ignore the fact that sex trafficking profits immensely from an open border? Same thing with drug trafficking? I‚Äôve seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement I‚Äôve read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much? ____________________________________________All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didn‚Äôt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, that‚Äôs how I was raised. You don‚Äôt judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think you‚Äôre a better Christian than the other person. THAT‚ÄôS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!____________________________________________So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away women‚Äôs rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.____________________________________________I‚Äôm sorry if this formatting is atrocious I‚Äôm on my phone. Feel free to leave your opinions down below I would love to have a discussion.Edit: Imma do what‚Äôs called a basic redditor move... thanks for the silver my dudesEdit: a fucking platinum, wow that‚Äôs pretty freaking cool nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan [ Removed by reddit in response to a copyright notice. ] nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan Anyone who knows how the Spanish language works knows that many nouns and most adjectives end in either "a" or "o" to indicate whether the word is associated with male or female. There is no real significance placed on the gender of something and it can be changed (specifically for adjectives) based on the gender of the subject. But the main rule is if you don't know the gender of the subject(s) or its a mixed group, it defaults to a genderless "o" or more commonly for multiple people "os". So, a female of Hispanic descent is a Latina and a male is a Latino. But all of the people of Hispanic descent, include both males and females (obviously), meaning they are Latinos. It doesn't make sense to make up another word to mean all Latinos because you think it's "too gendered" as the current word for it is already genderless. Last point, the term "Latinx" isn't even compatible with the Spanish pronunciation of it. In conclusion, this word is unpronouncable and redundant, ironically not unlike many of the other words the left creates to prove how compassionate and culturally aware they are. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan Trump is acquitted of all charges and the Democrats are showing their arses! Woo! nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan Welcome to hindsight in 2020We are devoted to learning from the past to apply fiscally conservative principles for the election in 2020.The idea of placing a candidate that the entire Republican Party can agree on and not just fridge candidates is one of our main goals. We do not want to repeat the mistakes of past convervative, neoconservative, [jeffersonians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffersonian_democracy)(the original trumplicans), moderates, centralist and libertarian republicans by isolating any of these movements. Instead, we seek to find a candidate that has something that appeals to all branches of the republican base and various sub parties. To that effort we do not condone bashing of any particular view point so long as it is in keeping with the following common interests of the Republican Platform:**Rule 1.** Individual liberty over the needs of the society... as it is the natural extension of "all persons created equal"- A. As a general concept we strongly discourage gerrymandering as it violates the right of the individual by making their vote worth less than another's - B. we also encourage movement towards preferential rank voting instead of the traditional single vote, single candidate system that tears the party apart every election cycle**Rule 2.** Balanced federal budget**Rule 3.** Government that is accountable to its citizens- A. We seek term limits on congress- B. More rigid enforcement of ethics violations**Rule 4.** Protection of citizens from monopolies (be they local or national)**Rule 5**. Recognition that there are times when consensus must be reached for the good of all citizens and that ideals MUST bend to reality for a good and functional state to serve its citizens, so long as they do not break rule 1.**Rule 6.** Religion is free from the government (with in reason) and government is free from religion (with in reason)**Rule 7**. As an extension of rule 3, reduce the amount of money in politics by limiting the amount of money a cooperation can use to support a PAC and a candidate.- A. Only the overarching "parent" organization should donate towards a PAC or candidate (no subsidiaries)- B. No organization should be allowed to donate any more than a citizen can.We do not accept bashing personal beliefs, nor bashing political ideals so long as said beliefs fall within the rules outlined above. We do encourage open discussion so long as the tone is civil and the conversation is of a discussion nature and non argumentative.We define "argumentative" as one or both sides being unwilling hear the others'. Should a thread turn this direction the mods will intervene. This is meant to be a place for anyone who values our 7 rules to come up with ideas on how to make the process better.  We allow shilling so long as that person of discussion fits within at least  5 of the 7 rules.  Any claims about a candidate must be sourced (preferably an official transcript).The goal of this sub is to look at the past and show what can be learned for the future. No topic is considered "non-recent" so long as there is something to be learned for the present/future and the topic hasn't been covered "too recently". In otherwords, we would like to have "hindsight in 2020."The best way of thinking about this sub is a place where Republican/Libertarian historians and futurologist can come together and discuss events and the common person can get questions answered from both.Happy debating. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan This is what we mean by Preferential Rank style voting.  It's a variation of score based votingTake however many candidates you have (say 6).Then ask voters to rank each candidate by order of preference. (1st pick, 2nd pick, 3rd, pick 4th and so on).1st pick carries 6 points (because there are six candidates)2nd pick carries 53rd 44th 35th 26th 1This method of voting allows parties to determine who the concession candidate is... ie the candidate the most people would be willing to support even if its not their "first pick".  This helps prevent the "buyers remorse" issue that many of the early voters of Bush, Carson experienced because now their votes still matter.  It also helps diminish the "my guy is my only option, so there is no point in looking elsewhere" mentality that develops during the course of these primaries.to see it in practice here's how it would work.  (warning math ahead)4 voters (Bob, Jack, Kate, Mary)4 candidates (A, B C, D)Bob ranks the candidates in order of preference Candidate A, B, C, and DJack Ranks the candidates B C A DKate C B A DMary A B D CIn this scenario, no one won more than 50%, candidate A came close but didn't get more than 50% so therefore did not get the majority of the voters and may not get enough support (this scenario sound familiar?).  But there is a candidate that everyone would agree on supporting.first lets award the points- "First place" gives 4 points because there are 4 candidates on the ballot- "Second place" gives 3 points because there are 4 candidates on the ballot- "Third place" 2 points- "Last place" 0 points because last place should be penalized **Candidate A** received First place twice (8 total points), Second place no times, third place twice (4 total points), and last place never- Candidate A has 12 points**Candidate B** received first once (4 points) , second 3 times  (9 points), third and last never- Candidate B has 13 points**Candidate C** received first once (4 points), second one time (3 points) and third once (1 point), last once- Candidate C has 8 points**Candidate D** receives 1 point because he/she was ranked last every single time except once.- Candidate D has 1 pointFrom this we know that the candidate everyone can at least support (maybe not enthusiastically but at least support) is candidate B.  And the candidate none would likely even support is candidate DNow, imagine if we had done this during the 2016 primary instead of denying voters a chance to say, "hey if this guy doesn't work out, Id be okay with this other guy".  By knowing who everyone's first second and third picks are, you ease the whole "internal unification" issue the Republican Party has had issues with as of late.  You also know who people simply can't support under any circumstances because you know who the "last place pick is".Now, if you wanted to muddy the waters you could also award something like 1/8 of the available votes to the person ranked 1st the most, but I think that would bring us back to where we started with this whole mess of winner take all states.If this had happened in this election cycle, Kasich would have beaten out probably anyone listed.  He was nearly everyone's "second pick" by most polls.  ##TLDR: **Preferential rank voting*** Allows voters to say who their second pick would be* Allows voters to say which single candidate is the "worst possible candidate"* It restricts the score range to the number of candidates* It doesn't consider the ranks sequentially but moves votes between candidates as losers are eliminated without having to do a single re-vote as the "next pick" have already been determined.* it's incredibly easy to tally as it just sums the values of the ranks. (IE scores)* It requires exclusive scores. (I.E. ranks, but the ranks are just scores when it comes to counting time.)* It can work with the current delegate system (states can decide how many delegates to assign vs sum of scores) or as a complete replacement: once every state has voted, the scores are tallied and the ranking is determined and removes the need for a convention except in instances of a tie. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan Now that Trump is President-elect, what is the goal of this subreddit? nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan So far, the four people I'm liking are John Kasich, Rand Paul, Justin Amash, and Susana Martinez. Now Kasich is the reason this sub exists, and a lot of us were Paul fans until he dropped out. As far as Justin Amash, he's quite the constitutionalist, though pro-life. Also, he's in favor of marijuana legalization, at least for medicinal purposes. Concerning surveilance efforts by the NSA, he is in favor of reigning them in. When we look at Martinez, she favors space exploration and respects the supreme court's ruling on gay marriage, though she isn't personally in favor. She opposes portions of Obamacare, but doesn't believe it should be entirely repealed. I have an issue with her support of common core, but she could be a decent vp. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan What are some issues he is deficient on?

It brought about an exceptional time in US trade and largely the reason we have a (somewhat) friendly relationship with Mexico given our tendency to annex their stuff.  The policy ended near 1945 with the ramp up of the Cold War.  Looking back, was this something we should have abandoned?  It was around this time that Latin and South America started going to pot... well cocaine too... Is this a policy we should consider bringing back?

There are a lot of republicans that have expressed an interest in stating opinions that run contrary to current stances.  I'd like this sub to be an outlet for that.  Yes we have our 7 interests but these are actually pretty broad so it should leave a pretty large area for discussion to occur.  To that end, I've changed a few things:I've updated the flairs for the interests so its easier at a glance to select which interest goes with with posts and added a filter link to each of the 7 interests listed in the side bar/community info.I've made the traffic stats of the sub available to all so they can see when the majority of users visit this sub and plan posts accordingly.And will be adding A LOT more articles discussing the various interests (as you may have noticed in your feed today) on a more regular basis.So what do we need from you?well honestly? simply being here with us and having a conversation goes a long way.I suspect many of you joined us because you either didn't or did support a specific candidate but I want to take this a little further.This sub is not just a "kasich" sub or a "anti-trump" sub.  It may give off that vibe from time to time, but honestly?  that gets pretty boring and there is a reason that interest 5 is a thing.

Plus there is no discussion, it's just a slurry of downvotes when you disagree with the agenda. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan There are about 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, this number is not disputed. (1)U.S. population 328 million as of January 2018. (2)Do the math: 0.00915% of the population dies from gun related actions each year.Statistically speaking, this is insignificant. It's not even a rounding error.What is not insignificant, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths:‚Ä¢ 22,938 (76%) are by suicide which can't be prevented by gun laws (3)‚Ä¢ 987 (3%) are by law enforcement, thus not relevant to Gun Control discussion. (4)‚Ä¢ 489 (2%) are accidental (5)So no, "gun violence" isn't 30,000 annually, but rather 5,577... 0.0017% of the population.Still too many? Let's look at location:298 (5%) - St Louis, MO (6)327 (6%) - Detroit, MI (6)328 (6%) - Baltimore, MD (6)764 (14%) - Chicago, IL (6)That's over 30% of all gun crime. In just 4 cities.This leaves 3,856 for for everywhere else in America... about 77 deaths per state. Obviously some States have higher rates than othersYes, 5,577 is absolutely horrific, but let's think for a minute...But what about other deaths each year?70,000+ die from a drug overdose (7)49,000 people die per year from the flu (8)37,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities (9)Now it gets interesting:250,000+ people die each year from preventable medical errors. (10)You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital!610,000 people die per year from heart disease (11)Even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save about twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.).A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides.Simple, easily preventable, 10% reductions!We don't have a gun problem... We have a political agenda and media sensationalism problem.Here are some statistics about defensive gun use in the U.S. as well.https://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3#14Page 15:Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million (Kleck, 2001a), in the context of about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008 (BJS, 2010).That's a minimum 500,000 incidents/assaults deterred, if you were to play devil's advocate and say that only 10% of that low end number is accurate, then that is still more than the number of deaths, even including the suicides.Older study, 1995:https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6853&context=jclcPage 164The most technically sound estimates presented in Table 2 are those based on the shorter one-year recall period that rely on Rs' first-hand accounts of their own experiences (person-based estimates). These estimates appear in the first two columns. They indicate that each year in the U.S. there are about 2.2 to 2.5 million DGUs of all types by civilians against humans, with about 1.5 to 1.9 million of the incidents involving use of handguns.r/dgu is a great sub to pay attention to, when you want to know whether or not someone is defensively using a gun‚Äî‚Äîsources‚Äî‚Äîhttps://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_02.pdfhttps://everytownresearch.org/firearm-suicide/https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhamcs/web_tables/2015_ed_web_tables.pdfhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings-2017/?tid=a_inl_manualhttps://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-accidental-gun-deaths-20180101-story.htmlhttps://247wallst.com/special-report/2018/11/13/cities-with-the-most-gun-violence/ (stats halved as reported statistics cover 2 years, single year statistics not found)https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rateshttps://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/faq.htmhttps://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812603https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2018/02/22/medical-errors-third-leading-cause-of-death-in-america.htmlhttps://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan Then, once there's only 3.5 billion, we can go back to capitalism, and maybe people will get it that socialism causes starvation. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan The wankers at Conservative and The_Donald (and I'm sure there are a bunch of leftist subreddits that do it too) basically just ban anyone who argues with them from commenting on their posts.

One of the non-parties Ms. Giuffre ‚Äúnamed‚Äù repeatedly in the joinder motion was Ms. Maxwell. According to the ‚Äúlurid details‚Äù of Ms. Giuffre included in the motion, Ms. Maxwell personally was involved in a ‚Äúsexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme‚Äù created by Epstein: ¬ß Ms. Maxwell ‚Äúapproached‚Äù Ms. Giuffre in 1999 when Ms. Giuffre was ‚Äúfifteen years old‚Äù to recruit her into the scheme. ¬ß Ms. Maxwell was ‚Äúone of the main women‚Äù Epstein used to ‚Äúprocure under-aged girls for sexual activities.‚Äù ¬ß Ms. Maxwell was a ‚Äúprimary co-conspirator‚Äù with Epstein in his scheme. Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page6 of 66 7 ¬ß She ‚Äúpersuaded‚Äù Ms. Giuffre to go to Epstein‚Äôs mansion ‚Äúin a fashion very similar to the manner in which Epstein and his other co-conspirators coerced dozens of other children.‚Äù ¬ß At the mansion, when Ms. Giuffre began giving Epstein a massage, he and Ms. Maxwell ‚Äúturned it into a sexual encounter.‚Äù ¬ß Epstein ‚Äúwith the assistance of‚Äù Ms. Maxwell ‚Äúconverted \[Ms. Giuffre\] into . . . a ‚Äòsex slave.‚Äô‚Äù Id. Ms. Giuffre was a ‚Äúsex slave‚Äù from ‚Äúabout 1999 through 2002.‚Äù ¬ß Ms. Maxwell also was a ‚Äúco-conspirator in Epstein‚Äôs sexual abuse.‚Äù ¬ß Ms. Maxwell ‚Äúappreciated the immunity‚Äù she acquired under Epstein‚Äôs plea agreement, because the immunity protected her from prosecution ‚Äúfor the crimes she committed in Florida.‚Äù ¬ß Ms. Maxwell ‚Äúparticipat\[ed\] in the sexual abuse of \[Ms. Giuffre\] and others.‚Äù ¬ß Ms. Maxwell ‚Äútook numerous sexually explicit pictures of underage girls involved in sexual activities, including \[Ms. Giuffre\].‚Äù Id. She shared the photos with Epstein. ¬ß As part of her ‚Äúrole in Epstein‚Äôs sexual abuse ring,‚Äù Ms. Maxwell ‚Äúconnect\[ed\]‚Äù Epstein with ‚Äúpowerful individuals‚Äù so that Epstein could traffic Ms. Giuffre to these persons. ¬ß Ms. Giuffre was ‚Äúforced to have sexual relations‚Äù with Prince Andrew in ¬ß ‚Äú\[Ms. Maxwell‚Äôs\] apartment‚Äù in London. Ms. Maxwell ‚Äúfacilitated‚Äù Ms. Giuffre‚Äôs ¬ß sex with Prince Andrew ‚Äúby acting as a ‚Äòmadame‚Äô for Epstein.‚Äù ¬ß Ms. Maxwell ‚Äúassist\[ed\] in internationally trafficking‚Äù Ms. Giuffre and ‚Äúnumerous other young girls for sexual purposes.‚Äù ¬ß Ms. Giuffre was ‚Äúforced‚Äù to watch Epstein, Ms. Maxwell and others ‚Äúengage in illegal sexual acts with dozens of underage girls.‚ÄùPage 234\- Picture of Maxwell, prince Andrew drew and Giuffre.\- Ms Giuffre travel records are incomplete, many examples. She was being flown by them without keeping records some of the timePage 243\- Detective Recarey knew that Maxwell was involved in the illegal sexual activities at Epstein's house. He wanted to speak to her, but Maxwell did not return his calls. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 28:23-29:10.\- A walk through video taken during the execution of the search warrant revealed photos of topless females at the home, and there was even a photograph of Maxwell naked hanging in the home. The house staff who were deposed in the civil cases each testified to Maxwell being the boss in charge of everyone in the house.

Tr. at 238:4-238:22; 302:19-303:10; 306:1- 306:24.\- Recarey testified that when the search warrant was executed, the house had been sanitized and the computers removed from the home. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 72:25-73:15.\- Banaziak testified that the computers were removed by Adriana Ross, another employee who answered to Maxwell. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 19, Banaziak Dep. Tr. at 54:7-22.Page 245\- Tony Figueroa, Ms. Giuffre's ex-boyfriend, did testify that Maxwell personally requested that he find and bring girls to Epstein for sex once Ms. Giuffre had escaped, and that when he brought the girls Maxwell interacted with them. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 4, Figueroa Dep. Tr. at 200:6-18; 228:23-229:21.\- Rodriguez testified unequivocally that Maxwell was "the boss" and that she knew everything that was going on. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 21, Rodriguez Dep. Tr. 169:1-169:4.\- Nude photographs were displayed throughout Epstein‚Äôs home. Furthermore, Alfredo Rodriguez testified to Maxwell having pornography on her computer. Rodriguez Dep. Tr. 150:10-17; 306:1-306:24.\- He also testified to there being a collage of nude photos in Epstein's closet. Id. 253:14-254:18. That collage was eventually taken into evidence by Detective Recarey, who testified to that fact in his deposition. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep.

Tr. at 25:19-26:20.Page 246\- Johanna Sjorberg testified that the Defendant bought her a camera for the specific purpose of her taking nude photos of herself. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 16 Sjoberg Tr. at 150.\- Virginia Giuffre testified that there was a nude photograph of her at the house. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5 Virginia Giuffre Tr. at 232 and 333.Page 264\- Johanna Sjoberg, testified that Defendant recruited her under the guise of a legitimate assistant position, but asked her to perform sexual massages for Epstein, and punished her when she didn‚Äôt cause Epstein to orgasm.\- Tony Figueroa testified that Defendant contacted him to recruit high school-aged girls for Epstein, and also testified that Maxwell and Epstein participated in multiple threesomes with Virginia Giuffre.\- the butler for Defendant‚Äôs close friend witnessed, first-hand, a fifteen-year-old Swedish girl crying and shaking because Defendant was attempting to force her to have sex with Epstein and she refused.\- Call this the ‚Äúyes-I‚Äôm-a-sextrafficker-but-only-of-sixteen-year-old-girls‚Äù defense.Page 265\- Flight logs even reveal twenty-three flights that Defendant shared with Ms. Giuffre ‚Äì although Defendant claims she is unable to remember even a single one of those flights.\- Defendant‚Äôs heavy and extensive involvement in both Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs sex trafficking ring and in recruiting Ms. Giuffre, living with her and Jeffrey Epstein in the same homes while Ms. Giuffre was a minor, and traveling with Ms. Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein ‚Äì including 23 documented flights. Even the house staff testified that Defendant and Ms. Giuffre were regularly together.Page 266\- The record evidence in this case shows that Defendant shared a household with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein for many years. While there, she actively took part in recruiting underage girls and young women for sex with Epstein, as well as scheduling the girls to come over, and maintaining a list of the girls and their phone numbers.\- Ms. Giuffre was indisputably a minor when Defendant recruited her to have sex with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Thereafter, Ms. Giuffre flew on Epstein‚Äôs private jets ‚Äì the ‚Äì Lolita Express‚Äù ‚Äì with Defendant at least 23 times.\- Ms. Sjoberg‚Äôs account of her experiences with Defendant are chillingly similar. As with Ms. Giuffre, Defendant, a perfect stranger, approached Ms. Sjoberg while trolling Ms. Sjoberg‚Äôs school grounds. She lured Ms. Sjoberg into her and Epstein‚Äôs home under the guise of a legitimate job of answering phones, a pretext that lasted only a day. A young college student, Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page12 of 74 5 nearly 2,000 miles from home, Defendant soon instructed Ms. Sjoberg to massage Epstein, and made it clear that Sjoberg‚Äôs purpose was to bring Epstein to orgasm during these massages so that Defendant did not have to do it.Page 268\- Ms. Sjoberg also testified about sexual acts that occurred with her, Prince Andrew, and Ms. Giuffre, when she and Defendant were staying at Epstein‚Äôs Manhattan mansion.\- **Prince Andrew using a puppet to touch Ms. Giuffre‚Äôs breast while using a hand to touch Ms. Sjoberg‚Äôs breast.**\- Tony Figueroa testified that Plaintiff told him about threesomes Ms. Giuffre had with Defendant and Epstein which included the use of strap-ons.Page 269\- Figueroa also testified that Defendant called him to ask if he had found any other girls for Epstein, thereby acting as procurer of girls for Epstein:Page 270\- Mr. Rizzo testified - through tears ‚Äì how, while working at Dubin‚Äôs house, he observed Defendant bring a 15 year old Swedish girl to Dubin‚Äôs house. In distress, the 15 year old girl tearfully explained to him that Defendant tried to force her to have sex with Epstein through threats and stealing her passport.Page 271\- Lyn Miller is Ms. Giuffre‚Äôs mother. She testified that when Ms. Giuffre started living with Defendant, Defendant became Ms. Giuffre‚Äôs ‚Äúnew momma.‚Äù 10 Incredulously, Defendant testified that she barely remembered Ms. Giuffre.\- Detective Recarey led the Palm Beach Police‚Äôs investigation of Epstein. He testified that Defendant procured girls for Epstein, and that he sought to question her in relation to his investigation, but could not contact her due to the interference of Epstein‚Äôs lawyer.Page 272\- Notably, at Defendant‚Äôs deposition, Defendant refused to admit that she flew with Ms. Giuffre, and denied that she appeared on Epstein‚Äôs pilot‚Äôs flight logs.13\- However, David Rodgers, Epstein pilot, testified that the passenger listed on his flight logs bearing the initials ‚Äì GM ‚Äì was, in fact, Ghislaine Maxwell, and that he was the pilot on at least 23 flights in which Defendant flew with Plaintiff. 14 The dates of those flights show that Ms. Giuffre was an underage child on many of them when she flew with Defendant.\- Both Sarah Kellen and Nadia Marcinkova lived with Jeffrey Epstein for many years. They both invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about Defendant‚Äôs participation in recruiting underage girls for sex with Epstein.Page 273\- Jeffrey Epstein invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about Defendant‚Äôs involvement in procuring underage girls for sex with him.Page 274\- Defendant has not been able to procure a single witness - not one ‚Äì to testify that Defendant did not procure girls for sex with Epstein or participate in the sex.\- Even one of her own witnesses, Tony Figueroa, testified that she both procured girls and participated in the sex.\- Another one of Defendant‚Äôs witnesses, Ms. Giuffre‚Äôs mother, named Defendant as Ms. Giuffre‚Äôs ‚Äúnew mamma.‚Äù Indeed, those who knew her well, who spent considerable time with her in Epstein‚Äôs shared household, like Juan Alessi, Alfredo Rodriguez and Joanna Sjoberg, have testified that she was Epstein‚Äôs procuress.\- Others who lived with her ‚Äì Jeffrey Epstein, Nadia Marcinkova, and Sarah Kellen ‚Äì invoked the Fifth Amendment so as not to answer questions on the same. No one has testified to the contrary.\- **Defendant has never offered a legal explanation for what she was doing with, and why she was traveling with, a minor child on 21 flights while she was a child, including 6 international flights, aboard a convicted pedophile‚Äôs private jet all over the world.**Page 275\- Defendant never offered an explanation regarding Ms. Giuffre‚Äôs photographs of her, Defendant, and Epstein.\- She never offered a legal explanation for why Prince Andrew was photographed with his hand around Ms. Giuffre‚Äôs bare waist while she was a minor child, while posing with Defendant, inside Defendant‚Äôs house in London.\- This photograph corroborates Ms. Giuffre‚Äôs claims, and there is no other reasonable explanation why an American child should be in the company of adults not her kin, in the London house owned by the girlfriend of a now convicted sex offender.\- Ms. Giuffre also produced pictures of herself taken when she was in New York with Defendant and Epstein, and from a trip to Europe with Defendant and Epstein.Page 276\- Ms. Giuffre has produced a number of pictures of herself taken at the Zorro Ranch, Epstein‚Äôs New Mexico Ranch.\- Among other nude photos, which included full nudes of Defendant, Ms. Giuffre produced images of females that the Palm Beach Police confiscated during the execution of the 22 See McCawley Dec at Exhibit 42, GIUFFRE007175; 007173.

The U.S. Attorney mailed Ms. Giuffre a notice of her rights as a crime victim under the CVRA.\- Ms. Giuffre has provided extensive medical records in this case, including medical records from the time when Defendant was sexually abusing and trafficking her. Ms. Giuffre produced records supporting her claim of being sexually abused in New York resulting in both 23 See McCawley Dec at Exhibit 44, GIUFFRE007584. 24 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 30, GIUFFRE 002216-002218, Victim Notification Letter.

The dates on the hospital records show she was seventeen years old.Page 278\- Defendant propounded wildly overbroad requests for production concerning the past eighteen years of Ms. Giuffre‚Äôs medical history. Defendant repeatedly and vehemently argued to the Court that it was essential to procure every page of these records in a fanfare of unnecessary motion practice\- Ms. Giuffre sought counseling from a psychologist for the trauma she continued to experience after being abused by Defendant and Epstein. A 2011 psychological treatment record, written by her treating psychologist, unambiguously describes Defendant as Ms. Giuffre‚Äôs abuser.Page 279\- Years before Defendant defamed her, Ms. Giuffre confided in her treating psychologist that Maxwell recruited her for sex with Epstein.\- Detective Recarey, the lead investigator of the criminal investigation into Epstein and his associates‚Äô sex crimes, recovered carbon copies of hand-written messages taken by various staff, including Defendant, at Epstein‚Äôs Palm Beach residence.\- The messages raise a question of fact as to Maxwell‚Äôs involvement in the sexual abuse of minors and are relevant to refute Maxwell‚Äôs denial of any involvement with Epstein during relevant time periods, and, accordingly her denial of knowledge of certain events.Page 280\- Messages reveals that Maxwell, ‚ÄúGM,‚Äù took messages at the residence, including from underage girls who were calling to schedule a time to come over to see Epstein.Page 282\- One message pad reflects , who is identified in the Palm Beach Police Report as a minor, contacting Jeffrey Epstein for ‚Äúwork‚Äù explaining that she does not have any money. The term ‚Äúwork‚Äù was often used by members of Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs sexual trafficking ring to refer to sexual massages.\- Giuffre 001462: July 5th no year to JE from ‚ÄùI need work. I mean I don‚Äôt have money. Do you have some work for me?‚Äù\- Other message pads reflect who was a minor, calling and leaving a message at the Palm Beach mansion that she has recruited another girl for Jeffrey Epstein. The second message demonstrates that Jeffrey Epstein required different girls to be scheduled every day of the week. The third shows an offer to have two minor girls come to the home at the same time to provide sexual massages. These type of messages indicate the lack of secrecy of the fact that multiple young females were visiting every day and at least raises a question of fact whether Maxwell was knowledgeable and involved as Giuffre has said, or whether Giuffre was lying and Maxwell was not at all involved or aware of this activity, as Defendant would attempt to have the world believe\- Giuffre 001428 ‚Äì undated Jeffrey From ‚Äì ‚ÄúHas girl for tonight‚Äù ;Giuffre 001432 (pictured above)‚Äì 7/9/04 ‚Äì Mr. Epstein From ‚Äì ‚Äú is available on Tuesday no one for tomorrow‚Äù; GIUFFRE 001433 /1/17/04 ‚Äì Mr. Epstein from ‚Äì ‚ÄúMe and \_\_\_\_\_ can come tomorrow any time or alone‚Äù ; Giuffre ‚Äì 001452 ‚Äì undated Jeffrey from ‚ÄúHas girl for tonight.‚Äù\- Other message pads demonstrate that there was a pattern and practice of using young females to recruit additional young females to provide sexual massages on a daily basis.\- Giuffre 001413 (pictured above)‚Äì JE from ‚ÄúN‚Äù ‚Äì ‚Äú hasn‚Äôt confirmed for 11:00 yet, so she is keeping on hold in case doesn‚Äôt call back; Giuffre 001448 -8/20/05 JE from - confirmed \_\_\_ at 4 pm.

Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page28 of 74 21 with the Defendant on September 10, 2005. The police were only able to retrieve a fraction of these message pads during their trash pull but even in the few they recovered, it shows Maxwell was regularly at the Palm Beach home during the time period she claimed she was not. To the contrary, she was both sending and receiving messages and messages, like this one, reflect her presence at the mansion.\- Giuffre 001412 ‚Äì 9/10/05 (during the year Maxwell says she was never around) JE from ‚Äì ‚ÄúI went to Sarah and made her water bottle and I went to work out with GM.‚Äù\- These message pads further corroborate that Defendant lied in her testimony and she was in fact in regular contact with Jeffrey Epstein during the years 2004 and 2005. For example, the message from ‚ÄúLarry‚Äù demonstrates that Defendant is at the Palm Beach mansion so frequently that people, including Epstein‚Äôs main pilot Larry Visoski, are leaving messages for Maxwell at the Palm Beach house.\- Giuffre 001435 7/25/04 ‚Äì Mr. Epstein from Ms. Maxwell ‚Äì ‚Äútell him to call me‚Äù; Giuffre ‚Äì 001449 ‚Äì 8/22/05 ‚Äì JE from GM; Giuffre ‚Äì 001453 ‚Äì 4/25/04 for Ms. Maxwell From Larry ‚Äúreturning your call‚Äù;\- This message pad shows that Defendant was clearly actively involved in Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs life and the activities at his Palm Beach mansion.\- Giuffre ‚Äì 001454 ‚Äì undated Jeffrey From Ghislaine ‚Äì ‚ÄúWould be helpful to have \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ come to Palm Beach today to stay here and help train new staff with Ghislaine.‚Äù\- This message pad clearly reflects an underage female (noted by the police redaction of the name) leaving a message asking if she can come to the house at a later time because she needs to ‚Äústay in school.‚Äù\- ‚Äù Giuffre 001417 (pictured above)‚Äì Jeffrey 2/28/05 Redacted name ‚ÄúShe is wondering if 2:30 is o.k.

Prior to being terminated by Defendant, the Palm Beach house butler Alfredo Rodriguez printed a copy of this document and ultimately provided it to the FBI.\- This document reflects the numerous phone numbers of Defendant, Epstein as well as staff phone numbers.\- Additionally, and importantly, there are several sections entitled ‚ÄúMassage‚Äù alongside a geographical designation with names of females and corresponding telephone numbers. These numbers included those of underage females (with no training in massage therapy ) ‚Äì including ‚Äì identified during the criminal investigation of Epstein. This document is an authentic reflection of the people who were associated with Epstein, Defendant, and the management of their properties, and the knowledge each had of the contents of the document.**Sex Slave Amazon.com Book Receipt**\- Detective Recarey authenticated an Amazon.com receipt that the Palm Beach Police collected from Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs trash.\- The books he ordered are titled:(1) SM 101: A Realistic Introduction, Wiseman, Jay;(2) SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for Erotic Servitude ‚Äì Principles, Skills and Tools by Guy Baldwin; and (3) Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their Owners, by Christina Abernathy, as shown below: 32 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 45, Phone List, Public Records Request No.: 16-268 at 2282 ‚Äì 2288.

Additionally, Defendant testified that she was not with Jeffrey Epstein in 2005 and 2006 when he was ordering books on how to use sex slaves; however, record evidence contradicts that testimony.Page 287**Thailand Folder with Defendant‚Äôs Phone Number**\- Defendant also was integral in arranging to have Virginia go to Thailand. While Epstein had paid for a massage therapy session in Thailand, there was a catch.\- Defendant told Virginia she had to meet young girls in Thailand and bring her back to the U.S. for Epstein and Defendant.\- Indeed, on the travel records and tickets Defendant gave to Virginia, Defendant wrote on the back the name of the girl Virginia was supposed to meet, and she was also instructed to check in frequently with Defendant as it was further signified by the words ‚ÄúCall Ms. Maxwell (917) !‚Äù on Virginia‚Äôs travel documents. In this case, Virginia also produced the hard copy records from her hotel stay in Thailand paid for by Epstein.\- The FBI report and the Churcher emails reference Ms. Giuffre‚Äôs accounts of sexual activity with Prince Andrew that she made in 2011, contrary to Defendant‚Äôs argument that Ms. Giuffre never made such claims until 2014. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan I thought this sub was r/librarian for at least a week nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan So this Video shows how the British government is in the process of Blocking all porn across the UK:  [https://youtu.be/-92AUypzmAU](https://youtu.be/-92AUypzmAU)&#x200B;The only way to gain access to porn legally then would be to hand your passport and bank details to a private company (Mindgeek) which own all the porn tube sites, so that they can verify your age and identity.

First of all, Mindgeek have had breaches to their services before, so what's to say they won't accidently leak millions of peoples passport and credit card details? secondly, it seems fairly obvious to me that mindgeek must have lobbied to make this "block" happen as it profits them immensely.

Far more complex than what we'll get into here I've been thinking about this a lot lately, more since talk of HK police using live ammunition. What does anyone think is going to happen here as force is escalated? It's going to be the same thing as every other scenario where people with guns tell people without guns to do a thing.This seems like an excellent example of why it's so important to keep and maintain firearms. No one needs a high capacity magazine attached to a rifle firing a hundred 5.56mm rounds a minute... Until that's the exact firepower you suddenly must stand against.Lastly, a question for the anti-gun lurkers here chomping at the bit to call me a tiny dicked conservatard phony tough guy: what are you going to do if a radical authoritarian takes the white house, brainwashes half the country, and refuses to step down? Law and order are temporary flukes in thousands of years of regime change and war.Edit for some key points and common arguments: it's not just about "muh gunz" it's about matching force. Every person, every movement, every government has a limit to how much force they are willing to use to achieve a goal. The current paradigm in HK *radically* favors the group with better weapons. This equation can't be balanced by retweets. Many are pointing out that China would massacre any armed resistance. This depends on China's willingness to maintain control and ALSO depends on the protesters willingness to risk their lives. Without even basic firearms, this is a meaningless option to them. They couldn't choose that path even if it was the last path necessary. They removed it years ago and now they're stuck under Chinese boots.Edit2: just passed 1776 upvotes üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan I recently heard that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez thinks that lawmakers should lose their salaries when the government gets shutdown and while I don't agree with 99% of what she says I do think this may be a good idea.[Link to article](https://www.newsweek.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-says-lawmaker-should-lose-salaries-too-during-1269591)What does everyone else here think of this? nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan That's all from me thanks for coming to my ted talk nan nan nan Why? Some may ask. Because every society founded upon Marxism as an ideology has lead to totalitarianism, the violent suppression of free speech, free press, freedom of religion, and any political dissent whilst producing widespread poverty. The death toll of Marxist governments almost certainly considerably greater then even that which the Nazis accomplished. Now, socially it is unacceptable to promote fascism or nazism. Good, these ideologies need to be thrown in the trash in of history. However, for some reason, despite marxism's comparably awful effect on the world, marxists and communists are not  held to the same universal condemnation. We have literal communists teaching in universities, oftentimes promoting apologia for past communist regimes. This would never be tolerated by a fascist, and it should not be tolerated by Marxist communists either. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan The mods have taken a stand in true keeping with their laissez-faire approach.

But we must do it as individuals.So I propose the Subreddit go on full voluntary lockdown. Nobody comment, nobody post, and we all go get some fresh air until Reddit smartens the fuck up and realizes that the users of Reddit stand with the moderators. In a way, the mods of /r/Libertarian have given us a unique opportunity to demonstrate the strength of this protest and show that even if the moderators fold, even if against all hope and reason, we all just shrug and go back to normal and just stop caring over stupid internet bullshit....

I feel this section is important because it shows the lengths Maxwell would go try to discredit Giuffre, even though in the first dump it appears the lawyers for Giuffre argued that very little of this was used in the defenses case in their motion to dismiss, and what is going on in the underlining proceedings involved in with the documents.

I don't know his name. I was instructed by Ghislaine to go and give him an erotic massage-	Q) She used the words erotic massage? -	A) No, that's my word. The word massage is what they would use.

Do you recall whether this was intended to be a full-time job? -	A) I don't remember if it was full time or just summer jobs or, you know, during season. It was probably for a season because Mar-a-Lago is seasonal. I mean, I was there year round but a lot of people are seasonal, you know, because it's like snowbirds, you know, summertime comes and nobody wants to be down in south Florida. -	Q) What would you call the season, the seasonal aspect of Mar-a-Lago?

I didn't really talk to Angela about what she had to do. I think that was her name, Angela. But it's kind of the name that sticks out. (Missing pages)Page 225-	A Where did I learn that? -	Q) Uh-huh. -	A) I think Virginia had told me that there was a lady in the spa area named Ms. Maxwell. I don't know her. I couldn't tell you what she looked like. But just she said Ms. Maxwell said she can get me a job with Jeffrey Epstein who is a friend of Donald Trump, so I figured, well, he was a good guy or whatever, you know, and that she was going to learn massage therapy. -	Q) When did Virginia tell you this? -	A) Oh, I can't tell you what date and time but I don't remember.-	Q I understand. Did she tell you this while she was working at Mar-a-Lago? -	A) Yes. I mean, after she had been there for a little bit, you know, and then she told me, yes, that she could possibly get this other jobPage 226-	Q) Did you ever meet Jeffrey Epstein? -	A) Once. -	Q) When was that? -	A) I dropped Virginia off at the house once and he came out and I met him and seemed just fine to me. I mean, you can't tell people by looking at them. I mean, I know now from, you know, what I've read that he's not a good guy. But you can't tell. You know, you don't even know your neighbors sometimes, you know.-	Q) Was it about the same time Virginia started working with him? -	A) Yeah. -	Q) Was it later? -	A) I think it was about the time she started. Because I wanted to see where she was at, you know. And it was just a mansion down the street from, you know, Mar-a-Lago. So I didn't think twice about it. I didn't think nothing of it. He came out.

The Dems are moving hard left to ensure their far left base gets out and votes, but by doing so they cede the center to the Republicans, who get those votes and win.Which in itself is fine, but it comes with a cost: Republicans actually have to *move* to the center to get those votes.  So while the GOP is beating the pants off the Dems, what we're left with nationally is, effectively, a far-left party and a centrist party.  This means the center of political gravity is to the left of center.*****So here's my question: perhaps it would make sense for conservatives to adopt a no-compromise attitude, including willingly primary-ing legislators who fail to show sufficient conservatism.Will this cost us votes?  Yes.  Will the lack of those votes mean we lose elections?  Yes, it will - but if the Dems want to win those elections by picking up centrist votes, they'll have to move to the center to take them, just as the GOP has.  Centrist swing votes have, according to this theory, become a poison pill that has allowed the minority party to push to the hard left/right, while dragging the party in power to the center.The idea is for the GOP decided to stick to their guns on conservatism, litmus tests and all, **even at the cost of elections**, and willingly became a minority party in exchange for becoming a conservative party, dragging the Dems to the center, and pulling the center of gravity right.Opinions?  Is this analysis only based on a recent trend?  Am I placing too much emphasis on the effects of parties on political culture?

Case in point: [Hispanics in America don't like the term "Latinx".](https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/01/98-percent-of-latinos-dont-want-to-be-called-latinx/)Also, nonwhite Democrats are more religious and less liberal than white Democrats.  If Republicans made a stronger effort to stop putting their foot in their mouth, they should certainly be able to peel off enough minority voters to make a difference.My personal suggestions:* **Take a sensible approach to crime issues.**  We should adopt neither the left's conciliatory attitude towards violent crime, nor should we take an excessively hard-nosed approach to nonviolent crime.  People selling dime bags of weed should not be getting run into the system.  Yes, don't do the crime if you can't do the time, but at the same time we don't want to take petty criminals, throw them into prison with hardened criminals, then after they serve their sentence, they've got reduced chances to make a legitimate living but now they have contacts with more serious organized crime.* **Consider getting ahead of the Democrats on ditching federal marijuana laws and returning the question to the states.**  Marijuana arrests again fall disproportionately on minorities, and it's an issue where the federal government has no business meddling.  We aren't talking about heroin or crystal meth here.  Federalism says we should be returning this issue to the states.* **Stop worrying so much about welfare costs.**  It's penny-wise and pound-foolish.  Welfare isn't a significant driver of our spending.  Social Security, defense, Medicare, and Medicaid are the top four expenditures...and Medicaid is a fairly distant fourth.  Those four comprise 85% of our federal spending, if I remember right.  We could eliminate everything else and still be in the red, but if we reform SS and Medicare (yes, I know, long-term goals that require a light touch) we're golden without touching anything else.  Minorities are disproportionately dependent upon welfare payments; making attacks on things like food stamps and WiC just alienates a lot of potential voters for the sake of an absolutely tiny percentage of our spending.* **Take seriously the ideas of holding police to the rules.**  I have a lot of respect for cops and a lot of the cases of their supposed wrong-doing end up being cases where the cop was completely right in his actions.  Still, the Fourth Amendment is a limitation on police power, and we have to take that seriously.  We can't pretend to be for limited government power and then mumble *something something law and order conservatism* every time a cop is accused of abuse of his power.  Some of these cases have turned out to be real, and we need to not treat them as meaningless.  Sometimes minority fears of being abused by police are outdated, but even in that case they're at least legitimate fears based on stories from their grandparents *actually* being abused by cops decades ago because of the color of their skin.  I don't think it's too much to ask that we take seriously their concerns and work to assure them that we don't intend to allow that to return.* **Emphasize school choice as a priority.**  Education is one of our most important areas right now; public schools are becoming increasingly open in their drive to indoctrinate kids into progressivism, and are often enough willing to openly punish students from dissenting from liberal creeds.  Black voters favor school choice as well, for even stronger reasons - too many of their kids are trapped in failing or even dangerous public schools.  Vouchers for private schooling is a conservative idea that would go a long way towards earning the votes of minority voters.* **Focus on religious liberty.**  As I said, nonwhite Democrat voters are more religious and less liberal than white Democrats.Just my two cents.  A lot of this seems like low-hanging fruit given how much the Democrats take minority voters for granted.  An election where the Dems only get 60-65% of the black vote would be a difficult election for them to win, for example. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan If you live in Wisconsin then there is an election TODAY!

Much of this growth is part of the legacy of the 1965 immigration act. We have gone from taking in around 300,000 people per year to over 1 million people per year [despite most Americans wanting immigration levels to either remain the same or decrease](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1660/immigration.aspx) and [the politicians promising us back in 1965 that this would not happen.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965#Legislative_history) Compare [the 2016 presidential election results at the county level](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Texas_Presidential_Election_Results_2016.svg/300px-Texas_Presidential_Election_Results_2016.svg.png) to [the population of Hispanics within Texas at the county level.](https://i.redd.it/ii9vkzmdm9w01.png) Also keep in mind that only around half of the Hispanic population in Texas is currently elligible to vote so we are not yet seeing the full impact this will have on Texan politics. Over the next two decades, that other half will come of age and the state will cease to be the Republican stronghold it has been for so long. As a result of this massive demographic transformation (the Texans never wanted), Texas is going to turn into a battleground state. If the Republican Party wants to survive, it has to start focusing on restricting legal immigration instead of just worrying about legal immigration. Does this worry you? Do you think the GOP is doing enough to prevent handing Texas over to the Democrats? nan *  Gerrymandering - which ensures incumbents stay in power*  First Past the Post - ensures taxation without representation *  Citizens United - which codifies bribery and malfeasance in office as legal               nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan This is a rambling on a specific issue.It's easy for us to attack states like California (which I'm from) and praise states like Texas. But what is necessary to create a functional and successful society? Where does it start from and what can we do about it? I'm going to discuss a notional concept that we are all aware of but don't really understand: culture. This problem is the root problem for every other problem that faces are society today.If you're a libertarian conservative or a social conservative you will probably agree that there is a root cultural problem within the United States. Even fiscal conservatives should be able to recognize that a cultural problem exists. But what is this problem? We have microcosms of culture throughout the United States: Urban vs. rural. Racial. West Coast, South, Central, East Coast, North East.What is culture?>a :  the **integrated pattern of human knowledge, belief, and behavior** that depends upon the capacity for learning and transmitting knowledge to succeeding generations>b :  the customary beliefs, social forms, and material traits of a racial, religious, or social group; also :  the characteristic features of everyday existence (as diversions or a way of life) shared by people in a place or time <popular culture> <southern culture>>c :  **the set of shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices** that characterizes an institution or organization <a corporate culture focused on the bottom line>>d :  the set of values, conventions, or social practices associated with a particular field, activity, or societal characteristic <studying the effect of computers on print culture> <changing the culture of materialism will take time ‚Äî Peggy O'Mara>Or the simple definitions:>: the beliefs, customs, arts, etc., of a particular society, group, place, or time>: a particular society that has its own beliefs, ways of life, art, etc.>: a way of thinking, behaving, or working that exists in a place or organization (such as a business)I believe the arts aren't an actually dictation of the culture, it's a reflection of the culture. So when we discuss culture I will be focusing on the **attitudes, values, goals,** that each culture is defined by. As this is the most important aspect that impacts our lives, our government, and our society.When the left pushed Multiculturalism and we allowed them; that fundamentally destroyed American culture, as by definition it's something that is shared. When people no longer share similar attitudes, similar values, similar goals, similar practices there is a clash of cultures.Where is our culture failing nationally? This is by no means a comprehensive list as the topic of culture would need to be covered in a series of books.Attitudes: A general attitude that each person is "owed" something. An entitlement. Has this always been the case? Probably not before FDR. It's fundamentally selfish (though there should always be self interest) that relies on others to do the work for the individual. No responsibility. An apathetic outlook on how one should change their life. And as any person *should* know this method of achieving anything leaves the person unsatisfied.Values:  A complete lack there of or a complete contradiction across the nation. Shared values is the basis for any society to exist and survive, and this has been fundamentally destroyed by the left. What do people value in general? There is an arbitrary valuing of "rights", though not of the specific rights or why they should exist. You tell any person that their rights are being trampled on, and they will be upset. This suggests that a possessive value still exists (though liberals are doing their best to destroy this inherent value as well) across the country. As in that person values what he or she perceives as something they own.The consistent value that can be found is the Id, the selfish possessive value. The rise of the alt-right and the entire left has shown us that people don't even value the rule of law on a consistent basis. Goals: The American Dream and the City on the Hill used to be common goals that most Americans shared. The left has destroyed this. Certain cultures within the United States lack goals completely, this ties into their attitudes and values. Without goals such as living up to a standard (Jesus?) or some other aspect, the culture stagnates and fails. ----Problem's facing conservatives:A problem we face as conservatives is what can be done about the cultural war the left as been waging for the last century? Libertarian conservatives like to pretend as if we should just accept it and any time we attempt to counter act it we are just as evil as those who perpetuate the destruction of American culture. Where do we start? The same spots that the socialists targeted when they started this cultural war? Education and media. How do we go about that? Conservatives tend to go into fields outside of education and media. So naturally these fields are going to be biased, and if they are biased the more the culture gets destroyed by the left.Can we perhaps make an effective campaign that ties to the Id based shared value? For instance liberals make the Id argument on abortion: women's right to privacy, to choose, to her own body! All arguments that immediately lend to the women's Id on the subject.Apathy? Are we not as willing to take the case to the public? We always assume a silent majority while the left is constantly destroying that majority? Do we not go to every public event and setup a booth to push our conservative positions? Show up on campuses to protest despicable actions taken by the faculty and students? Who are the motivated conservatives groups in recent history? 1.)Donald Trump's supporters 2.) The Tea Party 3.) Pro-lifers. The Tea Party being the only real conservative group that was successful at pushing our agenda and controlling the national narrative. The left was successful at undermining it and calling it racist. But it seems we need to keep bringing up a event exactly like that to keep the momentum active.The Reagan revolution was a win for us. But it was only a temporary revival of America and its values. The Tea Party was a strong movement of the same vein, unfortunately with no charismatic leader to move it forward. There needs to be a consistent organizational effort to push conservatives values/culture. We cannot depend on the Republican party pushing this, as the liberals don't depend on the Democrats.----Questions to you. Do you agree there is a cultural problem (not just within specific communities like Urban black neighborhoods)? What is the best methods of fixing this problem? Are we doomed to failure? nan nan nan What type of discussions do we wish to have?We can jump right into the muck and have a conservative #NeverTrump vs. Lesser of two Evils debate. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan Over the past year, we've been trumping up Trump's personal and social digressions. I think we focus too much on issues like this during an election cycle merely because we seek headlines to occupy ourselves. I don't give much of a damn for the things candidates say so much as what they will be able to do and pass once president.Trump would be a terrible president because of his policy prescriptions that he may be able to get passed through Congress, and this is something we don't talk about enough. And, all the while, he'd be the representative of the Republican Party, alienating future voters who believe that conservative/Republican policies lead to economic disaster (see: [the effect of George W. Bush's 2nd-term economic Leftism](http://www.truthrevolt.org/sites/default/files/styles/metatag_image_defalut/public/field/image/articles/obamaphone_3.jpg)).Let's look at the economic atmosphere. The Federal Reserve has been instituting a massive QE policy and [keeping interest rates artificially lowered](https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/197685/fed-funds-rate_large.png). Normally, the market sets the interest rates, or the price of borrowing money. So, when people save money in banks, the supply of money increases, and the price of borrowing decreases. At such a time, businesses and other enterprises take out loans in order to make capital goods and invest in future projects. Because people have been saving money, it signals to businesses that they have money to spend once their projects are completed.But, the Federal Reserve has artificially lowered interest rates for years now. So, the wealthy are taking out loans at these artificially low interest rates in order to invest in future projects at a time when people aren't naturally saving money. This is the definition of a bubble economy. Eventually, the hammer will drop and the country will either spiral into depression, or this environment of [< 3% real GDP growth per year](http://www.multpl.com/us-real-gdp-growth-rate/table/by-year) will become the new normal. No matter which of the two becomes president, they will have to deal with the reality of past policies, and likely undergo a severe recession at best.On the trade front, Trump may very well be able to pass new tariffs. Depending on how high the tariff is, it will have a significant impact on the average individual's standard of living. His income will be worth less because prices will inevitably rise. Thus, he will have to forgo certain American-made goods that he does not value as much and does not need, which means those industries will shrink accordingly and laborers must be laid off.In addition, as much as illegal immigration is a threat to security, it is also a boon to the economy. For the most part, these people do not get handouts from the government, though the Left has started doing everything within its power to change that over the past few years. Now, instead of hiring illegal immigrants under minimum wage, people must choose to either pay workers minimum wage for the service or forgo the service entirely. Either way, cost goes up, which affects other industries as well, and standard of living declines.Informal, off-the-books payments have protected us from the full effect of a true minimum wage, but that may change under a Trump presidency (or a Clinton one, if all are granted amnesty and therefore must be paid minimum wage). This isn't a defense of illegal immigration, as I haven't addressed the security aspect, so much as it is an honest look at what the effect of deportation would be solely on the economy.Trump's affinity for lower taxes and lip service to lower regulation may help offset *some* of his other disastrous beliefs, but in the aggregate, he's doing himself and the Republican Party no favors by attempting to lead us to economic depression that results in another Obama 4 years from now. Like most subjects, corruption can have multiple meanings. And I think we need to really review what is the greater evil when it comes to the public and to the United States.I'll start off with a few definitions from Google:**Corruption**:"dishonest or fraudulent conduct by those in power, typically involving bribery."*Fraudulent*:"obtained, done by, or involving deception, especially criminal deception."*Dishonest*:"behaving or prone to behave in an untrustworthy way"It is very easy to associate Hillary with corruption, but does Obama meet these qualifications? I don't think he was directly bribed but he was indirectly bribed (what Trump likes to brag about). Democrats try and claim that this is politics as usual. But is it? What do I mean by indirectly bribed? It's exactly what democrats projects upon Republicans, that big money interests buy power through political donations. Examples of kick backs?1.) **NSPS** [*Bribery*, *Dishonest*] The 1-2 years leading up to Obama becoming president in 2008, the federal government was implementing a vast *performance* based pay system. This means they were going to dump the legacy GS system that essentially awards more money the longer you've been at the job, not based on the performance of the employee. This system was hated by public unions (who don't like to compete) who in turn became the biggest donors of the Obama campaign in 2008. The federal government spent hundreds of millions (if not over a billion) implementing this across the DoD and several governmental branches. But the moment (the first week) Obama came into office he killed it and wasted the huge chunk of money that had gone into implementing and training the new system. It was very obvious a political favor for the money given to him during his campaign. Blatant and absolute corruption.2.) **Solyndra** [*Bribery*, *Dishonest*, *Fraudulent*] The CEO behind this donated heavily to democrats and to Obama's campaign during 2008. This is *after* Bush had denied the federally backed loan to Solyndra because it was clearly a loser and would go bankrupt (they reviewed the company and realized it wasn't sustainable). Along with the many other facets of corruption that came out of the stimulus (mostly kick backs to Democratic supporters) Solyndra was given a $500 million loan with no review from the Obama administration (even though on record the Bush administration had reviewed it and had determined it was a failure). The CEO pocketed it and the Obama administration never bated an eye lash about the corruption.3.) **Department of Justice** [*Dishonest*, *Fraudulent*]. The DOJ under Obama's lead has refused to prosecute clear crimes committed by the Blank Panthers while at the same time opening fraudulent cases against supposed racist police departments (in all cases the DOJ failed to find any wrong doing). ICE which is fraudulently being ordered to not enforce the law (a violation of Obama's constitutional requirements as president) the DOJ went and sued Arizona because they dared to take up the slack and enforce the law that Obama was ensuring was not enforced (mean while ignoring Sanctuary states like California where the Gov. straight up claims he will not enforce immigration laws and that illegals are free to come to his state in violation of federal law, while also ignoring federal law on marijuana).It is one thing for the DOJ to be consistent in its practice of ignoring supremacy clause, or racial disputes, it's another when the DOJ consistently 100% of the time follows a liberal progressive path to which cases it cares about. Literally the DOJ is supposed to be as objective as it can possibly be to the point that if the president did wrong doing the people could trust that the DOJ would prosecute him. Their recent handling of Hillary's blatant illegal emails demonstrates this clearly. Lynch meeting with Bill Clinton privately days before the DOJ issues through their FBI surrogate a statement that they aren't going to pursue charges. This is criminal level actions by the DOJ, but they know there is no one to take them down unless a Republican comes into the White House (or we have some whistle blowers).*****So there are many other areas to attack Obama on and probably several more examples of blatant corruption from the Obama administration (such as the IRS scandal and Bhengazi which people are probably sick of reading about).So the question is: Is Obama corrupt or is this politics as usual (still corruption, but an accepted form of corruption)? Was George W. Bush and his ties with the energy sector intentionally set out to pay them off? Clinton is too easy. How about George H. W. Bush or Reagan? Do we see similar patterns from those presidents?This topic does not include areas of intentional evil or incompetence by Obama. Please keep it on focus for corruption. nan nan In short: Democracy and Libertarianism is dying globally.Every nation on Earth including the US is going down a path of authoritarian and autocratic rule. China is helping with that process. as their influence grows, they will influence other countries or outright help them in becoming regimes as oppressive as China. You not afraid of other countries adopting or modifying their current credit scores to be.Given how "successful" China's Authoritarianism has been in accelerating the country into becoming a superpower, the nations of the world will switch to authoritarianism and adopt china's technocratic and Orwellian approach in order to gain that "success" abd "Stability.After the censorship,surveillance and social score are put in place, what comes next will be the re-education camps and labor camps to throw in those who still favor democracy and western ideals and those that have a brain for critical thought. All deemed untrustworthy by the Social credit score and declared untrustworthy by the word of the tyrants. do you not fear and consider this future.I dont even trust that our own governments will do the right thing and resist this because they only go where the money and the power goes. they never gave a shit abut any of us. They will push for it wether we like it or not and they will get it at all costs. and besides every politician in power is either a psychopath or hungry for power and wealth and nothing else. or even both.Your values will mean nothing and will be outlawed when we all end up having to share the same fate as the chinese mainlanders.Oh and you will have to choose: - would you prefer being ruled over and monitored by a technocratic Orwellian totalitarian state or would you rather be monitored and constantly exploited by a corporatocracy ruled over by megacorporations? you choose. nan nan nan nan https://primexbt.com/giveaway?referralCode=4x92vR4&refSource=copy nan * **The hatred.**  Far too many Leftists hate Conservatives as people.  Simply mention a Conservative position and they attack you personally.  Immigration, Voter ID, food stamps, taxes, religious freedom, Israel, education, jobs = Racist, elderly-hating, poor-hating, rich loving, homophobic, islamaphobic, religious nutjob, corporate pawn.  In my opinion, when you accuse people of things like that without basis, you're not a good person.  * **The assumption that if you oppose the method of achieving a goal that you oppose the goal itself.**  If we say; "Hey, I don't think this is the way to fix health care..."  The most common reply is; "You just hate poor people and want them to die in the street!"  That's ridiculous, of course we want to help the poor, of course we want to improve health care, we share many of the same goals we simply have different approaches.  * **The complete misunderstanding of Conservative positions with no honest attempt to learn about the positions.**  95% of Liberals cannot accurately articulate any Conservative positions and the logic behind the position.  Guess what?  There are reasons we have the positions we have, they might even agree with them, and if they fully understood them it would at least make finding common ground a lot easier.  We generally know the Liberal positions and the reasons for the Liberal positions, they are unavoidable with today's media.  * **The spending.**  The country cannot afford it, the excessive spending has to be stopped.  It's a ticking time-bomb that is going to make the last recession look like the good ol' days.  It's not fair to our kids and grandkids, and yes, we actually *do* care about that.  We know that Bush also spent too much in his last two years, there's a reason his popularity fell to 25%, we hated it when he did it too.  We know that many Congressional Republicans like to spend too much, there's a reason we call them "RINOs".  The Left seems to think that sharing the blame is a solution.  It is not a solution.  I do not believe that the Left sees deficits and national debt as an issue, regardless of the amount.  * **The judging of laws by the intent of the law instead of the real world impact of the law.**  Banning "assault weapons" will do nothing to stop gun violence.  Banning large soda containers will not solve the obesity problem.  Making people dependent on Government will not help them move up into the middle class.  Throwing more money at 50-year-old unsuccessful programs will not solve the education problems in poor neighborhoods.  Attacking corporations will not create jobs.  We need to identify root causes and address them head on. Am I the only one who is just sick and tired of politics ruining *everything*? From superhero nerds claiming Trump is a supervillian to game developers changing historical settings to fit a SJW worldview, hell, I can't watch a football game or listen to 'Baby It's Cold Outside' without being reminded that a very vocal political side considers me evil. I just want to disconnect from politics and enjoy my life but they keep dragging it back. I firmly believe that we have to engage and fight back against the Cultural Marxists but I also want to have a quiet, enjoyable Christmas. Am I wrong? Thoughts? Now that it's over, I'm honestly saddened. It's like we went through something as a country that tore us apart. I don't feel like we won. I feel like we all lost.God help this nation. nan nan nan nan nan Future president? She is not a staunch conservative; but politically she has a lot going for her.

Bush and flounder about in pursuit of such an agenda? nan I've seen some conservatives trash-talking Cruz a little bit for being supportive of this [ObamaRomneyRyanTrumpcare](http://babylonbee.com/news/republican-aides-hastily-scribble-trumpcare-obamacare-new-gop-health-bill/) thing that the House passed this week.  I agree with the commentators who have been saying that this Frankensteinian horror is just one more step toward [single-payer,](http://www.dailywire.com/news/16120/watch-krauthammer-says-within-7-years-well-have-frank-camp) which should not come as much of a surprise.  And of course that's no problem at all, unless you mind those fun episodes where people [die while waiting](http://thefederalistpapers.org/us/dying-teens-final-wish-exposes-pure-evil-of-socialized-medicine) for their government-rationed treatments to come through.So if you're a conservative in the senate, your choices are looking pretty grim. On the one hand, you have your capitalist base citing this as [The End of Freedom,](http://www.dailywire.com/news/16109/end-freedom-republican-senator-federal-government-ben-shapiro) but you also have your more simple-minded constituents who just want that blasted individual mandate gone, and they will presumably be very unhappy if Obamacare is left in place as-is.  You also find yourself thinking that the "moderate Republicans" in Congress will never vote for a full repeal again, because the Dems have somehow managed to successfully scare the wits out of them. The _right_ answer would probably to vote against the bill, in hopes that people in time will see that Obamacare is unsustainable and must be completely dismantled. But patience and wisdom are hard to come by in D.C., especially among those skittish politicians hoping not to be ousted in 2018. There almost seems to be no way out at this point.And again, none of this comes as any surprise. I know some people don't want to blame our glorious Wall-Man-in-Chief, but come on. Instead of draining the swamp, he just cannonballed straight into it, and now the only people pleased with both the spending bill and the AHCA are [Trump and establishment Republicans.](http://www.redstate.com/joesquire/2017/05/06/no-one-happy-week-trumps-fault/) Just recently, His Royal Orangeness was [praising single-payer again,](http://www.redstate.com/sweetie15/2017/05/05/spokeswomans-clarification-trump-doubles-praise-australias-healthcare-system/) offering yet another vindication for those of us who accused him of being yugely in favor of Leftist, big government policies way back when something could have been done to avert this political circus.So what's a conservative in the U.S. Senate to do? They're between a rock and a hard place from what I can tell, and things are most likely just going to get worse from here. nan In all seriousness, five years ago I was excited to move to my new  coastal urban environment. This new urban area used to be conservative, but slowly in the past years has become predominately filled with liberals. I had lived in a small inland rural town before that and that town is still conservative. I always dreamed living in a college town, urban environment, and being in a more populated area I'd have better luck finding work and a better life. Boy was I wrong....Liberals in a city have been nothing but toxic waste. I've called my local politicians who are liberals to complain about issues only for them to rudely hang up on me. I've gone to the job center to seek job help out only to be yelled at by an angry old lady and called a failure in life. I've appealed to county about their job center workers. The county would has a lady that is New England transplant with a MSW and she tells me that conservatives and this area are bad for jobs and I'm not going to get anywhere, so she says I should move to a state like Indiana. She brought up politics when I mentioned her to approach was that liberals in this area aren't making a different. I honestly think we need 4 more years of a conservative president to whip these mean liberals in shape. There is so much poop in San Francisco. Our politicians aren't out there cleaning up the environment or the poop. They pay some one else minimum wage and expect them to do the dirty work. While the liberals in my state, live comfortably, many middle class and below middle class are struggling. I'm a highly functional, educated individual with a BA degree, substitute teaching credential,  Comptia A+ and Net+ certified, and have worked since I was 15 because I value my independence and privacy. But because I live in a liberal controlled part of my county I get no help from county job center workers that are inadequate and pessimistic about their jobs. In my old town, if you needed help, your neighbor came to your head. Democrats want more government, but government has never helped me and I don't want their help anyways. Democrats you need to learn: 1. You don't hang up on your constituents who have concerns.2. As government workers you don't yell at people. If you're in the helping industry, you help.3. Stop complaining about issues if you aren't out there. You are never out in the homeless shelters or streets or fighting to help people. Democrats you want to give you a dollar and call it good.My only conservative representative is an assemblyman. My senator, governor, city, and county reps are democrats. While I haven't seen Trump directly impact my life, I believe he has been busy with other issues. Give him more years and he will come up with another one of his interesting solutions to get the CA government workers and leaders to respect his constituents and his strategy for this nation. **EDIT: Cleared up my post** nan This plan is shockingly bad.  It's so bad that even /r/politics is shooting it full of holes (although they still love Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez).* Replace all planes with trains.  * Ban combustion engines.  * Ban all fossil fuels as well as nuclear engergy.  * Replace every building in the US to make it energy efficient.  * Guaranteed income for people who are "unwilling to work".  * Government provided housing, healthy food, health care, & income for everyone.  * Ban "farting cows".  This is a huge embarrassment to the Democrat Party, but in particular to AOC.  So why didn't Pelosi do anything to stop it?Could this be a case of her own party giving her enough rope to hang herself in order to get rid of a distracting annoyance? nan nan A couple of days ago a redditor [asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/comments/5xru97/are_any_republicans_here_willing_to_be_interviewed/) /r/askaconservative if there were any Republicans willing to be interviewed for a school project. I offered to help and immediately received a dm explaining that his project involved understanding "new perspectives." He also asked 4 questions, the first of which I think is the most interesting: "What do you wish others knew about people who are Republican?" It forced me to think of misconceptions non-conservatives have of us, why it's so, and how to combat the falsehoods. I eventually came up with three myths and gave the guy a quick write-up about each.___**Myth #1:** Conservatives are motivated by hate.The left has done a fantastic job at convincing liberals and moderates that conservatives are filled with rage and hate. The assertion seems to confirm itself if all you know of conservatism is its indecorous charlatans like Michael Savage, but it really couldn't be further from the truth. I oppose the progressive agenda not because I hate the people they claim it helps, but because it threatens ideas and institutions that I love. The great British conservative Roger Scruton made this point better than I ever could: ‚ÄúI think that, in the end, there is something that unites all conservatives, which is that they are pursuing something they love. [...] We are united by love: love of our country, love of institutions, love of the law, love of family, and so on. And what makes us conservatives is the desire to protect those things, and we‚Äôre up against people who want to destroy them.‚Äù**Myth #2:** The right is intellectually vapid.The intellectual tradition in American conservatism runs deep. At its roots you'll find intellectual giants like Russell Kirk, William F. Buckley, Milton Friedman, F.A. Hayek, Robert Nisbet, Richard Weaver, Frank Meyer, M. Stanton Evans, etc. They were followed by another generation of great minds: Richard Epstein, Antonin Scalia, Thomas Sowell, Walter E. Williams, Roger Scruton, George Will, David Horowitz, Robert Bork, etc. The tradition continues by scholars at think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation, AEI, Hoover Institute, and CATO, on the pages of National Review, National Affairs, The New Atlantis, Modern Age, and the Weekly Standard, and by intellectually rigorous media personalities like Ben Shapiro, Ross Douthat, Larry Elder, Charles Krauthammer, and Jonah Goldberg. Those who care to understand conservatism will find no shortage of intellectual stimulation.**Myth #3:** Poor or middle class conservatives are "voting against their interests." Progressives say this all the time. Usually its an attack on poor or middle class Republicans, but is also used against racial/religious minorities, women, or any other group the left believes they champion. The presumption that you can know the whole of a man's interests by looking at one aspect of his life (income, race, or religion) reeks of the smug arrogance that I argue is among the precursors to tyranny. One one hand I wish progressives would stop saying this - as a middle class conservative this myth offends me personally. On the other hand I actually hope that progressives keep telling us deplorable wretches that we don't know how to take care of ourselves - it has played a huge role in elevating the Republican party to the [most powerful it's been in 80 years.](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/11/17/republican_party_the_strongest_its_been_in_80_years.html)____Fellow conservatives: what other myths can you think of? Why do these myths exist? How do we change the narrative to better reflect reality?And please feel free to comment on the three I identified. Tell me if/where I screwed up, how you would debunk them, and why you think they have caught fire among progressives. nan Why wasn't the Soros question asked near the end answered with "No, I'm not particularly involved with George Soros" instead of - I'm paraphrasing - whenever someone says George Soros might be a bad actor, it's just an antisemitic conspiracy theory like the Jewish Banking Conspiracy started by the Russians.I mean, isn't that actually, positively insane? Soros has his fingers in so many pies in the US and that part of the world, and is an obvious partisan.So, either she could have taken the opportunity to say she, Vindaman, the ex-Ambassador weren't at all involved with Soros or his organizations, or that she and some of them were and should have just shrugged it off.Instead, the implicit warning to "not go there" is made: anyone who goes here is an anti-semite.The implication to me is that for many of the national security figures, Soros represents a sort of normalized, consensus, pro-democratic foreign policy (instead of one of globalist currency hacking and influence peddling that is fundamentally the same as our Democrat party), and the possibility that Soros isn't "in the middle" of a reasonable spectrum of thought is literally unthinkable.And it seems to me that it's precisely that unthinkability of such a proposition amongst the career intelligence and foreign service elite that might be the essence of the dysfunction. That the 'deep state' is that part of the government that seems to believe that Democrat party policies are representative of neutral, nonpartisan American policies. nan First off I am very glad that people are seeing through just how badly the left wishes to gain and keep power.  I really am.  It is giving me hope for this future.And I really don‚Äôt want them feel unwelcome but I do want to caution them.  As these folks come over to the conservative side, I rarely see them say anything about budget or regulatory conservatism.  Only, ‚Äúcan you believe what the Dems did during the hearing?!‚Äù  Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I am glad we‚Äôre at agreement here, but I don‚Äôt want people thinking that they can bring their ‚Äúbig government ways‚Äù over here with us.It is precisely because we reign in government powers, that we have the positions we do on speech, gun rights, and innocences. The left has been chanting this since he was elected (literally). I caught a news snippet that Amash has proposed it which now gives the left some legitimacy to to their *narrative*.To be clear impeachment can be used for any reason what so ever. They could do it on the grounds of Trump being orange and they hate orange people. Impeachment is not a legal procedure, it is a political procedure (as Nixon came to learn). For any republican to actually suggest something like this right now is absolutely dumb. Yeah we would like to have Pence over Trump any day of the week but you are quite literally setting us up for massive election losses in 2018 and to lose the presidency in 2020.Impeachment is something you would bring up if Trump was under investigation (which he is not) and it is all but certain he is guilty. I have seen quite a few conservatives being duped by the media frenzy that has been pushing impeachment (as have the entire DNC leadership) since before he was sworn into office.Let us not get caught up with how Trump is incompetent; we know that. Tell me what you think on possible impeachment and why anyone would be stupid enough to add legitimacy to the Democratic narrative. nan There is a political messaging that has dominated the conversation that implies an equal break down between pro-life and pro-choice. Conservatives have allowed the "team sports" aspect of politics (partisanship) to murky the waters enough that Democrats have managed to maintain power on the issue that they should be losing horribly over.Below I do a break down of a running Gallup poll to show how the Democrat Party platform is not only a extremely minority position; but that the entire Pro-Choice argument is not nearly as wide spread as we have been led to believe by politicians and the media.----Polling Breakdown----http://www.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspxIf you refer to the second chart you will see that the population itself doesn't fully understand what side they are on and flip back and forth based on perceptions of what it means to be "Pro-Choice" and "Pro-Life".If you follow the first graph you will see that the vast majority of people want restrictions abortions. Only the most hard core leftists would like it completely open.Now the real meat of my Title:If you go down passed the first table two the second table they break out the full positions of the people answering the poll: Legal under any, Legal under most, legal only in a few, illegal in all.What you see is that 55-60% of Americans stated "legal only in a few" and "illegal in all" for the last several decades. Legal only in a few is the largest plurality of any position on the debate. Legal under most ("Pro-Choice" breakout): A few restrictions such as partial birth and 3rd trimester and possibly a brain activity defining factor. This still contradicts the Democrat Party platform as well as Hillary's stance, but this would fall more under the "Pro-Choice" side of the argument.Legal only in a few (Pro-Life breakout): A few exceptions to allow the procedure in cases of Rape, Incest, Health of Mother, Birth Defects and the like. Of the total abortions performed these types of abortions only make up roughly 5% of all abortions (total). Meaning 95% of all abortions would be ended if this large plurality saw its position enshrined in law. This position I would argue is Pro-Life.Pro-Life has been the dominant position on abortion issues since the start of that table in 1994 (and probably longer). Where literally  in recent years this position has made up roughly 60% of the entire population.----The Conservative Problem----So what is going on? How are Democrats able to not be crushed over this issue? We would then need to refer to the next table (or the 2nd graph). Some of the people who stated that they want abortion to over all be restricted with only a few allowance are describing themselves as "pro-choice". It is not a pro-choice position, but they have been duped into thinking they should support pro-choice policy/politicians.We saw a reflection of this messaging problem occur in 2012. One month before the presidential election we had a few Tea Party Conservatives make some stupid statements that were further quote cropped by the media to undermine the Pro-Life position. "Rape doesn't cause" pregnancy. I believe this was Akins, but that doesn't really matter. What we have is people who believe exceptions should exist for rape are suddenly concerned that all abortions are going to be banned, which is *exactly* what the left and the media cashed onto in 2012.Exit polling showed that the majority of Americans thought the economy was the top issue. The polling also showed that the majority of Americans thought Romney was best suited to fix the economy. *Yet* they voted for Obama due to fear for what Romney may do (on issues like abortion).There is a fundamental disassociation of what "Pro-choice" means and "Pro-life" to the point that people who are literally on the pro-life side of the argument are voting for pro-choice people. This is caused by the following:1. Partisan divide on the issue. Team sport. Pro-Life Democrats seemed to have died early on in the Obama years. So Democrats are able to use the partisanship to fear monger on a whole host of issues. So a person that leans left on economic issues but has a pro-life stance on abortion will "identify" as "Pro-choice" and vote accordingly.2. Democratic fear mongering. They, with the eager help of the media, are able to paint the entire Pro-life movement as the "illegal in all" category. This of course makes people feel uncomfortable with trying to make women who were raped carry the baby to term thus they claim they are "pro-choice". Meanwhile the Democratic Party Platform "No restrictions on abortions" is incredibly fringe with less than a 3rd (at its highest polling) of Americans who would actually endorse such a position. It's amazing how dominantly the left controls the narrative in the country.3. Unsurprisingly poor communication abilities by the right. The hard core "illegal under any" circumstance don't understand that it is a incredibly fringe position (even more so than legal under any). And that allowing a few exceptions would ultimately lead to a nullification of 95% of all abortions performed. The right needs to understand the media is 100% against them on this and needs to act accordingly. They are often duped into taken an "illegal under any" because they are questioned on the purity of their argument. Once they are duped it is easy for the left to demonize the issue as binary.4. Framing the issue. The left has managed to pervert the liberty argument to claim it is a liberty question to be able to kill another human. This is how you even have a decent number of "legal under any' leftists. As they have been brain washed into thinking personal freedom is at stake here. Libertarians will often fall on their swords thinking this is a liberty question because the left has so thoroughly mind fucked them.----My Proposed Solution----Unify the political messaging and focus on a winning argument. "Abortion is not a form of birth control". The *vast* majority of Americans agree with this. Hammer it home, chant it, and the Democrats will fold like a wet noodle. Admit that "abortion is a valid medical technique", which alleviates the concern of those pro-life people who have been duped to supporting pro-choice policy/politicians. What we do is differentiate between what "birth control" is, and medical procedures. This clear divide quite quickly ends the Pro-Choice movement. The debate would continue about "illegal under any", but I wouldn't support that side but I understand why some would take it. I don't disparage you for that position but I believe that there are reasons to end human life. It shouldn't be done callously (as our current system of abortion does) and should require checks and balances to ensure it is done for the right reasons. ----Conclusion----Pro-Life is not just a winning argument and moral. It is literally a one sided issue that strongly favor us that conservatives have been losing due to poor communication and framing the issue. As Ben Shapiro often states, don't let the left frame the issue and don't let them force you to defend the comments of another person. History has shown that the more people take for granted in life, the more self-obsessed they become.Symptoms of the disease include disconnection from family, disregard of tradition, ungratefulness, and obsession with convenience.Half a century ago, the majority of the world grew their own food. People lived, worked, and prayed in the same community over the course of their lives, just as it had been for generations.Through hardship and war, people were reminded of their roots and their positions in their lives and families.But thousands of languages and traditions are now extinct thanks to mass international globalization and development.The first sign was the highways that cut through the farmland, then people seemed to come and go more.Masses in Africa flooded into cities which shot up in just a few years.Those market villages in Thailand, are now engulfed by Seven Elevens and suburban fields of McMansions.A person in Turkmenistan can send a text message to Argentina in under a second.Internet, laziness, constantly being taken care of.With no roots, nothing to live for, people live fantasies instead. This isn't much of a stretch if you buy into the fact that the left has adopted Post Modernism which is 100% in conflict with rationalism and the scientific method. ----https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX8kEjSUr04Interesting point made earlier on in the video that I picked out. The left often disagrees with the *methods* of science, where the right often disagrees with the *conclusions* of science. For instance ‚ÄúCreationism‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúEvolution‚Äù. One is much more anti-science than the other, as science is nothing without its rationalism and methodology which the left has completely abandoned. They feel ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù because they are backing a ‚Äúscientific‚Äù conclusion more often than their political opposition, but they aren‚Äôt backing those conclusions for *scientific* reasons. It‚Äôs like get a math problem correct but showing no work for it.Oddly the left is coming off as more dogmatic when it comes to science than the right. I guess this isn‚Äôt odd at all as they are often very willing and eager to pronounce their beliefs as facts (Post Modernism).Another interesting point is the supposed Republican war on science literally has no causalities. They are not shutting down research or the scientific inquiry, yet the left are. If you are involved in scientific research that runs counter to the dogma of the left they will destroy you and run you out of your university or grant. Years went by that any scientists that attempted to do research to the ‚ÄúClimate Alarmism‚Äù was singled out and harassed, his/her grants here denied, and they would look for a  way to destroy their life/careers. In the last 2 years several scientists working from a skeptical viewpoint have had their offices/buildings shot up (not covered by the MSM).The left hates the fundamental idea of science. The right loves the process of science, but will always challenge conclusions made by such institutions (as like every institution it can be corrupted). The left is the political movement that has propped up ‚ÄúPeer Reviewed‚Äù science instead of repeatability. A fundamental aspect of science going back centuries that has led us to where we are today. Peer Review allows dogma to control the ‚Äúscience‚Äù that gets published in papers like Nature, while completely failing to demonstrate that the theories/conclusions are indeed repeatable and can stand up to scrutiny. ‚ÄúThe debate is over‚Äù is a common mantra of the left on subjects of science that they want their dogma to win out on.---- Late in the video they mention a concept of basic economics, and it was dismissed as a denial of the environmental realities‚Ä¶ That isn‚Äôt quite science, but economics does have centuries of data and backing for it, yet it is dismissed with such ease by these Post Modernists.Another interesting note on things like Evolution. Nearly every creaitonist I have ever talked to on this topics (more than 10) they all agreed evolution exists. Literally. This is not an exaggeration. Why? Because I can walk through the observable evolution from generation to generation of a species, and since they are prone to follow the scientific method they understand that it is true. What they disagree with is human origin theory and origin of life theory. Yet these people are cast down as ‚Äúflat earthers‚Äù and ‚Äúanti-science‚Äù. Ben Carson was a world class brain surgeon who is a creationist. Yet the left would tell you because of their dogmatic take to certain science that he would not be competant to work in any field of science because of his position on the subject.----What do you think? Do our fellow conseratives who do not accept scientific conclusions in areas that differ from their religious beliefs just as bad as the left? What is the correct level of skepticism to science and its conclucions? nan nan I have noticed this personally, and it does concern me that our fears during the primary of the "alt-right" infecting the party/conservative movement may have been valid.The chain of events that seems to have unfolded:* Leftists actually helped downplay the risk by calling everything Trump has done being "literally Hitler", which is quite an exaggeration, causing everyone to assume any name-calling of Nazism is "Fake News".* There has been a small, but growing movement of actual Nazism within the Republican Party and conservative circles.* Attempts to bring this up are largely ignored and shutdown at Party events, since we seem to have forgotten our history and, become immune to this due to assuming it is all "fake news".  In some regards, it may also be Party *over* Principles.* When Trump broke through political correctness, he inadvertently(?) opened up the door for radical factions and political anarchist to fill the void.* There has been an unusually large amount of European based groups showing up on the national scene, that I have personally not heard of before. Be it "[Anti-Facists](https://www.theepochtimes.com/the-communist-origins-of-the-antifa-extremist-group_2282816.html)", from the left, or "[National Front](https://spectator.org/once-a-nazi/)", "[Order of Vit√©z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Vit%C3%A9z)", etc. from the so-called "new-right".* After having watched "[The Soviet Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1OZYoxaJ2Y)", it appears that, at least in Europe, the far-left and far-right worked in tandem to bring tyranny. Sometimes Stalin and Hitler were even working together to oppress the innocent.To give some recent examples (some from leftist websites, but noteworthy events nonetheless):* [Watchdogs: GOP‚Äôs Man in Israel Illegally Lobbied for Anti-Semite](https://www.thedailybeast.com/watchdogs-gops-man-in-israel-illegally-lobbied-for-anti-semite)* [Tennessee Republicans block resolution condemning neo-Nazis](https://thinkprogress.org/tennessee-lawmakers-refuse-to-pass-legislation-condemning-white-nationalism-c9d056ffac23/)* [An Actual Nazi Is About To Be The Only GOP Candidate In A Congressional Race](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/arthur-jones-republican-nomination_us_5a77d3f6e4b0905433b5bd84)* [CPAC Told Those Criticizing Marion Le Pen to Do Their Research‚ÄîSo I Did](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/cpac-told-those-criticizing-marion-le-pen-to-do-their-research-so-i-did/)People within the party bringing this up, or merely questioning it, are promptly booed off stage. The rise of completely blind party support and/or populous *Nationalism*, is not something I am used to seeing within the party. ---So to summarize, Is the rise of Nazi sympathizers an actual threat to the Republican Party? Or a passing fad?To what extent do rising stars such as [Gorka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Gorka) or [Le Pen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Mar%C3%A9chal-Le_Pen) adhere to this foreign ideology? I used to get upset, but now I'm just amused.There are multiple posts rambling about how the wealthy will benefit more than others from tax breaks.  People are complaining.  No - they are.... they're complaining.At first, I thought, "*[dsmith1067], you should post a lengthy comment explaining how only those who actually pay taxes will benefit from 'tax' cuts. Duh!*"  Then I realized that trying to explain **the obvious** to these people would be a lot like performing a magic trick for a dog.  The dog watches you and knows you're doing something important, but the the dog lacks the capacity to be dazzled by it.I don't know the actual ratios (so I won't pretend to cite them here), but roughly 90% of all taxes paid are paid by the wealthiest 10% of Americans.  Where are the complainers about that imbalance?  But expecting someone who is (in actuality) paying a relative ^^microscopic amount in taxes to reap some sort of 'equivalent' benefit from tax cuts fails every test of logic.  In one post [a NYT article if memory serves me correctly] they lamented that some $1,500 (One Thousand Five Hundred dollar) break was small compared to the millions the top .01% (one-tenth of a percent) would see.  Really?  ##Doesn't all this fall under the category of "No Duh?"Anyway, I'm not going to even attempt to help others understand.  I dunno there's something rattling around in the back of my head about pigs and the perils of trying to teach them to sing. >    This is a paper presented several weeks ago by Herb Meyer at a Davos, > Switzerland, meeting which was attended by most of the CEOs from all the major > international corporations-- a very good summary of today's key trends and a > perspective one seldom sees.> >    Meyer served during the Reagan administration as special assistant to the > Director of Central Intelligence and Vice Chairman of the CIA's National > Intelligence Council.

My dad, brother, two uncles, three cousins and a nephew all served.  I'm wildly patriotic.#DON'T CASTIGATE THE UNPATRIOTICPatriotism should be felt (like love).  If you force it - well, you're faking.##Look at North Korea.  Here's a country of "wildly patriotic" citizens.  But are they?  Really?  I worry that the current trend of 'shaming' folks (specifically NFL players) into patriotism makes us **literally** no better than North Korea.  I mean it.We should embrace that not everyone feels patriotism at the level we do.  That's perfectly okay.  Likewise, it's okay to be pissed off at their lack of patriotism.  **BUT**, and this is a doozy, we MUST resist the urge to shame people into conformity.  Really.  Look at the dictatorships around the globe where guilt, shame or fear are used to *inspire* patriotism.  Don't we all see right through that?  I do.No.  Let people kneel.  It's okay.  Rather than say "They Should"... ##say "It's a shame they don't."It's a subtle difference... but an important one.  Feel bad that they don't realize and understand what an amazing gift it is to be in the United States.  Sympathize with their grievance, and allow them NOT to feel the same pride in our country's greatness that you feel.  The shame is their own.   Disturbing things:* the request for loyalty from Comey?* the possibility of taping Comey during a dinner with Trump?* (joking about?) the suggestion to end press briefings?all of this strikes me as wrong in principle, in addition as bad optics.  what say you, loungers? nan nan nan nan nan nan Terms----- Alarmist ‚Äì People who tend to spread alarm about the subject.- Global Warming ‚Äì Average mean temperature of the entire planet increases.

You will often see people mix the two together or some who only play in the poltical sphere. It is important to distinguish between the two of them as this art of deception is par for course for leftists. On the political front conservatives instinctively know something is wrong. They don't even need to know the science to the know that the left is not being honest with how they push this. This is often why you had/have conservatives who come out completely denying "climate change" or that the Earth is warming. The left has *equally* ignorant people who accept any end of the world declaration as factual and "scientific". Skeptics have rightly compared these people to religious fanatics based on their adherence to some mythical belief in scientists and how they are super human.I will go through the Science and Politics and give explanations for this discussion. I will not dive down into the weeds and spam links to papers or resources.----The Science----This all began with a theory that is fairly sound and was first put together in the 19th Century called "**Green House Gas Theory**" that is based on principles found throughout Physics in topics like fields and waves. The idea is that there are certain molecules in our atmosphere that are opaque to thermal radiation (black body radiation). When the thermal radiation interacts with said molecule, instead of passing right through it like it does with Oxygen and Nitrogen, it will be absorbed by it. After absorbing said energy it will re-emit the thermal radiation out random, where sometimes that energy will be returned to the Earth's surface heating it up more.There are a few questions that come from this:1. How much of that energy is re-emitted when convection compared to a known physical principle that is the most efficient means of a gas to transmit heat. Convection meaning gas molecules bumping into each other and transfer heat among the other gases. Entropy pushes these gases higher into the atmosphere.2. Are there diminishing returns to gas concentrations in our atmosphere? The answer is yes, as more and more CO2 takes up a larger and larger percentage of the atmopshere, the amount of thermal radiation it can trap decreases. It actually follows a logarithmic curve that provides a set amount of warmth added to the mean average temperature of the planet per *doubling* of CO2 concentration in our atmopshere. So at the start of the 19th century before industrialization we had ~280 ppm (parts per million molecules). Today we have roughly ~400 ppm. To see 1 degree rise in average temperature we would need to increase concentrations to 800 ppm. To see a total of 2 degrees rise in temperature you would need 1600 ppm. Notice that even after we have been burning fossil fuels like crazy we aren't even close to doubling the concentration from the 280 ppm yet.3. There are more than one Green House Gas in our atmosphere that trap different frequencies of thermal radiation, is it possible we have already maximized the absorbtion of CO2? As once you're 100% opaque, you can't really be higher than that. Some scientists have claimed that once the band is maximized some how the frequency band expands capturing more frequenices, thus more energy.From this theory alone you cannot figure out how the alarmists have made this into an issue. Green House Gas theory only predicts .7-1 degree Celsius of warming per doubling of CO2. Which will never be an issue for us, as by the time you can pump that much CO2 in the atmosphere you have long run out of fossil fuels and you're probably approaching CO2 poisoning bofore the warming is even an issue. I think it's like 10,000 ppm before you start seeing adverse health problems.So you have a scientists who say they believe in man made climate change, as the above theory is pretty rock solid. But how do we get to the extreme heat death of the planet theories that the IPCC has tried to push as science in the past?**Feedback Mechanisms** are used to propagate this theory into a cataclysmic event. You have "Positive" feedbacks and "Negative" feedbacks. A feedback in a "system" is when a forcing is adding something to your system and acts to increase the effect on the system. Say your system composes of moving a car. The engine is broken down, so you are "pushing" the car, which is a forcing on the movement of the system. You come to a point where there is a down hill slope, thus your push suddenly translates to a large amount of movement as the feedback of gravity and a slope carries the car down hill with very little force from you. That would be a "Positive" feedback. A negative feedback might be you pushing the car up a hill. Quite quickly your forcing will be canceled out by the "Negative" feedback, and the car will either stop or start rolling backwards. To put simply the positive feedbacks will enhance warming on the atmosphere while negative feedbacks will reduce the amount or negate warming on the atmosphere (or potentially even reverse the warming). So the lack of snow cover from the higher temperatures, results in less reflectance of the sun, meaning the energy is absorbed by our soil and heating up the planet. But some how this will be greater than the larger amount of moisture in the air due to temperature rise that results in a more consistent cloud cover that reflects the incoming solar irradiance back into space (thus cooling).So alarmist scientists have pushed a little known theory that has zero scientific evidence to support it that "Positive Feedbacks" are the dominate nature of our atmopshere, and that Negative feedbacks are small and insignificant. Again, there is *zero* evidence to support this, but all the computer models and alarmists scientists have pushed this theory. This how alarmists and the IPCC can take that .7-1 degree temperature rise per doubling of CO2 and claimed 6-12 Degrees Celsius per doubling. The recent hiatus in warming has called the IPCC to revise it down to 3-6 degrees celsius as their models have been completely wrong in predicting the global average temperature for the last 20 years.Now to be fair to some of the scientists involved, there was a spike of warming observed in the mean average temperature between 1980-2000. At this same times the Solar Irradiance had not changed and Sun Spot activity was also unchanged (yes the Sun is the main forcing on the planet). So because the scientists couldn't explain the sudden rise in warming via natural means, they **assumed** all the warming had to have been from a human forcing, such as CO2.What they failed to account for was the PDO (Pacific Decadal Occilation). I'm sure you have all heard that the heat is hiding in the deep oceans as an explanation for the "pause". This isn't completely untrue. The PDO cycle is a multi-decade long cycle that releases and absorbs heat from the pacific ocean. This is like El Nino and La Nina (highs and lows of the ENSO cycle), but unlike the sudden spikes of that climate phenomenon them is a long upward and downward temperature trend caused by the ocean. This is 100% traceable throughout the temperature record.Another thing they failed to track was Aersols (lowering the amount of sunlight reaching the surface) in the atmosphere (reason people were fearing an ice age). There is a two century long trend of warming (started before the Industrialization) that saw a cooling in the 1940's (despite the massive amount of new CO2 being pumped into the atmosphere) due in part to Aersol's (though it also was impact by the PDO cycle). By the time you get to the late 70's aersol usage was nearly gone due to the fears, thus causing a sudden spike in warming. So along with a warming trend from the PDO cycle and aersol reduction the scientists attributed a substantial amount of warming to CO2.To conclude the Science: The amount of warming caused by CO2 has been greatly exaggerated. Some of the exaggerations were intentional, look at Climategate, CRU, Paleoclimate Reconstruction fix, Michael Mann, and the political forcing on scientists in the lead up to Kyoto. Michael Mann should be behind bars for intentional fraud for what he did in the late 90's. The science indicates there is probable warming caused by humans, but the amount is unknown and likely to be small. Geological history has shown the Earth with CO2 concentrations at 3,000 ppm, 5,000 ppm, 10,000 ppm. The Earth was literally all CO2 early on before life. This is actually the lowest CO2 levels in the history of the planet Earth. Meaning any theory that perpetuates a "run away green house effect" is ignoring the vast majority of Earth's history. This is why there are a lot of skeptics in the geological field of science.The Climate related fall out will be rolling out over centuries, not decades. Like with everything else, humans will adapt and will find it a nuisance at most. A warming Earth is better than a cooling Earth. The climate should continue to be studied, but it shouldn't be given vastly more money than other scientific pursuits as Democrats have currently done.----I guess I'll save the politics for another time. This is long enough as it is./r/climateskeptics have quite a few good people to talk to on this subject. I haven't visited there in years. They are mostly skeptics. /r/science has allowed their politics to cloud their judgement on this discussion. I have greatly summarized large sections of this and skipped some other subjects as I know long posts like this can be intimidating to jump into. Feel free to jump in though :). I haven't had as much time as I'd like for posting on our new forum here, but with the election just a few days away I figured I'd send out one last pitch for the guy who I'll probably be voting for on Tuesday.  Actually, I'm going to defer most of it to a fairly thorough Diary written by [cantenucci04](http://www.redstate.com/diary/cantenucci04) at RedState.  But before that, the main thing I really want to convey is this: we may be standing at the dawn of one of Yeats' crazy gyres (don't worry about it if you're unfamiliar), but fear of what is to come is simply not the best determinant of your vote.  It seems to me that the major political parties have taken your support for granted, because after all, choosing neither of them is somehow delusional, dangerous, irresponsible, and to hear them tell it, you'd be helping whichever candidate you hate the most by voting third party or independent.This is not only nonsense, it's insulting.  They are calling your bluff, because they presume you to be cowardly.  People like Dr. Carson and Jerry Falwell Jr. have begun to take the position that values and principles need to be "put on hold" so we can "get things done" because "we're going off a cliff."I say stand your ground.  I say doing the right thing is always going to be better than compromising your honor.  I realize we will never have a "perfect candidate," but dang it we have to have some kind of standards.  If a candidate hasn't earned your vote, don't give it to him.  And if more of us would adopt that approach, maybe this really could still be the Home of the Brave.**So anyway,** on to the Diaries.  cantenucci04 touches on:    1. Economics and domestic policy  2.

Life experiences and qualifications to be president#Getting To Know Evan McMullin: The Only Presidential Candidate Who Is Both A True Conservative And Qualified For The Office He Seeks ## [Part 1](http://www.redstate.com/diary/cantenucci04/2016/11/02/every-conservative-vote-evan-mcmullin-president-part/)## [Part 2](http://www.redstate.com/diary/cantenucci04/2016/11/02/enough-conservatives-vote-trump-case-candidacy-evan-mcmullin-part-2/)P.S.  You know, I don't agree with everything McMullin says, but he has the right _message_ for America right now.  We need someone with character and integrity speaking up for founding principles, and Evan fits the bill.  I can vote for him with a clean conscience. We're all conservatives; but share some background on your positions and how you came to them. This will probably remain a small community as those being invited are those who have posted thought provoking posts in the past and care about Conservative positions.So format:1.) Give some history. State? Age? What's happening in your life (may be too personal, and this board can be read by anyone).2.) How you got to your current political positions? Who was a big influence on those positions (family, great political thinkers, some event in life, etc).3.) Your political priorities. What do you think is the most important political subjects at this time and weigh them. Perhaps you care about abortion, but you find immigration to be twice as important.----Please review the sidebar as we have links to an archive of discussions (though it hasn't been updated recently). The recent comments function is useful to track on going discussions that maybe in a week old thread. And we have recently launched a discord server.For submissions we ask that you frame any link as a starting point for a discussion. This is **not** a news aggregate subreddit. We are here to foster discussion to explore and investigate our conservative philosophies.  nan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JIWwDW_OzA1791L analysis of Tucker and Shapiro‚Äôs divide. It‚Äôs an amazing discussion because unlike the Left and Right debate in the U.S. These are people who actually share values, yet see very different means of addressing them. Was this once what the Democrat v. Republican debates looked like? This video seems to side with Tucker a lot more than Shapiro which is actually pretty interesting as 1791L is typically libertarian. Shapiro‚Äôs position is more of the libertarian position, Tucker is siding with the ‚ÄúCompassionate Conservative‚Äù position which has fallen out of favor in recent years. So to see a libertarian side with the compassionate conservative position makes me reconsider their argument.The problem Tucker is facing is predicting human innovation. Shapiro says rely upon the free market, as it has delivered us so far, Tucker says that it will not thus we need to protect jobs for the sake of culture and a possible social upheaval due to cultural collapse. Interesting enough this sounds very similar to Marxist theory.Globalism has shown a drastic impact on the economy of the United States. Some people will state it is for the better, since we have cheaper and more abundant goods than ever before. Others would say it is bad due to "fly over" country and rural areas being shut out of the economy. We effectively force people to relocate to the cities and to the coasts in order to remain relevant in the economy.Are there jobs for low intellect men? Yes. Will they pay well? Probably less and less so. Though this is a function of many things, there may come a time where energy prices are too exuberant, so low intellect individuals will have a job within the economy (which is what happened when oil prices were high under Obama). Those people will still need to move, which results in the death of middle America and the culture that existed there. Low intellect/educated people will be more and more required to travel compared to their higher intellect counter parts in the economy. Meaning the stable factory worker culture of the 20th century is gone. And as this video points out, the "community". Conservatives in general should care about the community as it is a core aspect of our value system (unlike libertarians).As for the Google employee. I think he's full of shit, there is no sense of exponential growth in technology. What we are seeing are fields of development maturing faster due to being unknown before the 20th century. Physics in general has been static with very few break throughs in the last century. We do not have flying cars, colonies on Mars, or functional fusion power. What we do have is emerging computing resources and data analysis. So our most mature sciences and technologies are actually pretty static. Emerging fields are playing catch up which provides the illusion of vast technological progress. Not to say these things aren‚Äôt good, but it's not the same thing as long held fields that have been around for centuries advancing at the rate he claims. Assuming his "20,000" years in 1 century prediction. It's not just low intellect people who will be out of the job, you will quite rapidly see most professions outside of PhD's be replaced within that time frame. And even Phd's will mostly be limited in use compared to what automation and AI is developed.How do we deal with job irrelevancy? The Tucker argument is that we protect those irrelevant jobs, as it will protect the culture and communities we value. Clearly that is bad as that will lead to stagnation and will rapidly lead to a United States as a third rate country in the world. The Shapiro side would argue we allow the dynamic forces of the market to handle it. A large surplus of people needing jobs will either adapt or find use. Perhaps a middle ground is necessary? Limit growth of automation? Though will that just force the out sourcing of those jobs anyways?---Video shifts direction to focus more on the importance of culture and religion for the masses. Showing that religious people are more happy and content than non-religious even accounting for education and intellect. This seems to be 1791L attempting to justify the argument that culture is indeed important as a value. Though there is nothing in the video that provides clear evidence of what is causing the culture death of Capitalistic countries. Shapiro claims people through individual choices have decided to turn away from religion and are reaping the rewards of such a choice (very libertarian). Tucker is saying that how the market economy is structured incentivizes such a cultural destruction. Then there is of course the theory of cultural marxism which isn‚Äôt really touched much in this video, that there is intentional destruction of the culture by post modernists who realized Marxism had failed and looked for another means of making it occur. Shapiro seems to imply this is the case, but it's not covered by 1791L.Interesting, is Tucker a Marxist? Not that he supports the outcome, but that he believes it will happen and feels the government must play a role in avoiding it?As such is raw Capitalism what they are suggesting? Is it not just a free exchange of goods among people? Or are they referring to a toxic culture that has taken root? Conservatives believe two contradicting positions:1. The United States is special and the values it was built upon are unique in a history full of tyranny. Individual Rights and liberty are not the default human condition. Thus we must fight to protect and defend it at all costs.2. We should allow the free market to run unfettered. People should buy and do whatever their heart desires. Doing any form of regulation against it would be a bad idea as the market will "deal with it".Number 1 would seem to suggest that number 2 would result in a moral decay of society. As in we have let the human condition run amok which ultimately leads to poor social/cultural outcomes. Yes we reap the benefits of the economic benefits capitalism brings (which is uncontested the best economic system yet conceived) but at what cost?----Who do you think is right in the Tucker and Shapiro discussion? This seems to be the divide between the main factions of the GOP. "Compassionate Conservatives" are called "RINOs" and "Neo Cons". Yet Trump seems to be exactly that, a compassionate conservative though his emphasis is on nationalism instead of globalism.If there is a middle ground, what would that be? In the lens of protecting American culture Tucker suggests protectionism. How would such culture be protected without it? And if that culture is loss can our Constitutional Republic survive when only Conservative Intellectuals postulate rationalism in support of it?Do you think there is a Cultural Marxist movement that is causing the problems or a natural by-product of Capitalism Excesses which has driven us down this road (or both)? nan I've done quite a few posts on this in the past. But people are wondering why even with the far left wing crazy politics of the left how is it that they keep gaining ground. The following will give a break down of the problem we are facing. This has nothing to do with "race" and everything to do with culture and education.----Not the exact three you were thinking of: Media + Academia + Immigration (combined with low native birthrates).This is how it works out:Birthrates are way down due to cultural shifts and mass abortion. 3rd generation + immigrants (people who can trace their families back 3 or more generations here in the United States) have birthrates around 1.4. You need 2.1 in order to maintain your population size. Which means without immigration our total population would be in decline like Russia and many other countries around the world.An entitlement state that demands a large work force and a massive business structure that needs a work force import 1 million+ immigrants every year (just so happens a very similar number of babies are aborted every year). These immigrants come from all over the world, but from the most part cultures very different from ours. The United States is a great experiment, and our perception of rights and limited government is not shared by many. These people come in inclined to support left wing positions, even though they may have moved here due to the business atmosphere.By and large the immigrants vote left leaning or Democratic. This is the first time where the media comes into play. They assault people who have no cultural roots in the United States with propaganda about our society and the evils that need to be fixed. They are already left leaning individuals in a lot of ways with no roots in the US. The media moves a large group of people who might be moderate towards the left.First generation immigrants are where all our "births" are coming from. Few cultures adore butchering their own children, even leftists ones across the globe (except for our Fascists version here in the United States). The US has a larger than 2.1 birthrate (just barely) due to these first generation immigrants and 2nd generation immigrants have mass amounts of children (in comparison to 3rd generation+ immigrants).These new children are raised in families which are not culturally rooted in the United States, still speaking their native tongue to an extent, and go to schools set to indoctrinate them. Media again comes into play, though less so via the news, and more so through pop culture. Comedians, movies, music, etc. They have no reason to reject this obvious and blatant attack on American culture, since they have no yet shared in it. So not only are the parents left leaning, their children are radical left.Throw in multiculturalism which is what the left has been pushing for the last half century, and you ensure these groups do no have a shred of American identity much less rooted in the culture Americans typically have. Thus ban speech, guns, republicans, etc.----An example of this is California. The all American state, was moderate but had great Republicans and Democrats alike. California in the last 2 decades had a net loss of Americans leaving the state to the tune of nearly 4 million people. Yet the state's population has continued to grow, and the state has "magically" shifted further and further to the left. Many of the 1 million immigrants that come to the United States end up in the coastal states as that is where the jobs are. California has literally replaced its native population with immigrants (at the active behest of Democrats, who understood this starting in the late 90's).It is currently totaled that 1/4th of the citizens of California are people who were not born in the United States. There are 40 million people here, that means 10 million people. Even more of the 40 million are the children of said 10 million people (remember they have higher birthrates). Even more people are illegal immigrants.I would recommend watching/reading Victor Davis Hanson as he covers many of the problems of California.----What can we do about this? Not really anything. We can't stop immigration as our economy and entitlement state would collapse. We have no access to the media nor academia. All we can do is hope that those people who are not culturally rooted in American values realize the evil of progressiveness before it is too late. But say there are 500,000 former democrats willing to "walk away" due to this understand. There are 1 million new democrats arriving every year, and children coming to age who have been brainwashed into voting for this far left movement. There seems to be this impression among those who identify as "fiscal conservatives" that the culture war is irrelevant and only a "social issue". This seems odd and shows a distinct lack of awareness in terms of how political coalitions or movements are launched.A thought that should occur to Fiscal Conservatives is: "Why does socialism keep rearing its ugly head even though it has proven itself a failure and its predictions failures a multitude of times"? I mean any rational or fact based person would understand this... Yet Bernie Sanders nearly won the Democratic Primary and is highly popular in many states. And yet Venezuela turned towards it even though its economy was booming and Capitalist economies like the United States in the 90's were shown to be the truly successful systems.If fiscal conservatives cannot grasp why the culture war is important, how do they explain these problems? Do they think people are just incredibly stupid and haven't been given enough evidence of sound policy?----I posted a video a couple of weeks ago about Post Modernism. And I think all conservatives and even moderates need to understand it. It is absolutely important and quite possibly the most pivotal problem we as a society are facing. As in the root of many of our societal issues is derived from this mindset.Marxists started as movement that was based on semi-rational thought and was predicated on predicting social behavior. They saw themselves as scientists, and they were certain that there were inevitable outcomes of the Capitalistic societies that were taking over much of the world in the 19th and 20th centuries. We saw similar offshoots of "social scientists" who perpetuated Eugenics which was widely supported by progressives here in the United States. Again predicting outcomes on limited if not completely unknown data sets.Those of us trained in science, understand that there have been countless theories that been proven false. For every solid "law" like theory, there are a hundred that had proven fruitless. We also know the history of human arrogance regarding such scientists. Where certain scientists would refuse to believe their theories debunked even on their deathbeds. Really smart people who were so attached to an idea or perception that they could not let it go. Typically when they pass on the new generation will either evolve that idea or completely dismiss it as they were not attached to the idea of some old scientist who was unable to prove his theory.So it is not unreasonable for a group to think they can predict human behavior. Though one must be skeptical of such chaotic systems. Fast forward 100 years and we are in the middle of the 20th century. It is quite clear socialism was a failure and that all Marxist theories about Capitalistic economies did not pan out. Your science is only as good as what it can predict. Which in this case was nothing. Those who had setup socialist states were incredible despotic dictators who killed tens of millions of people or imprisoned vast swathes of their population. And it was almost never a worker based revolution that reformed society that created any of these places.This ideology/theory had been passed down for generations. Taught at this point in American Universities. Really smart people believed in this theory, because it wasn't just some scientific theory. It was the moral/ethical evaluation that these people also bought into. There was no doubt by any reasonable people that the facts weighed against Marxist theory. That it was debunk. Their prediction of human behavior did not pan out in any form, and was more believable in fiction.So you had a group that had pretended to follow Rationalism and Fact based science to form their conclusions, faced with the ultimate evidence that they were wrong. But it was something that they truly believed in. As again this movement was in part a "moral" theory as well as a scientific theory. In comes Post Modernism, the bane of our society and culture. In previous posts on this board I mis-attributed these deductions to people who use "emotions" to formulate opinions. And while that is true... the root is more sinister than that. For the "useful idiots" emotion is indeed how they come to their conclusions. But for the intellectual elites or those who investigate these issues and still support these failed policies do so because of Post Modernism.What has post-modernism allowed them to do? They can frame any and all facts or conclusions through their political lens because the mindset dictates that no one can really truly know the truth. Thus institutions of knowledge, institutions of scientific practice and rigor, anything our society has taken for granted cannot be trusted. They justify this by deconstructing history and saying things like "Slavery was legal and wide spread for all of human civilization, clearly long standing institutions can't be accepted as correct". It's a grain of truth wrapped in a body of lies (the best type of lies). It ignores the long rigors work by individuals to come up with the civil liberties to build upon he institutions and to "progress" society. As in those institutions were never static, they were a continuous development of the human condition. A body of work that has been built upon and developed over thousands of years. And they undo it in a single dismissal of that work since it started off wrong.This would be equivalent to using early theories by Darwin on evolution as a means to dismiss all current research on evolutionary biology. Or claiming a system of laws is wrong because some country at some point previously had implemented horrible laws.---Why do "moderates" need to care about this? Because they do not understand the frame work in which this movement is working from. They are told they are here to "progress", where in reality they are here to deconstruct or regress. We call these people "Cultural Marxists". Even mentioning this phrase often times gets people to randomly come in here and scream that no such thing exists (as in there is a automated bot that informs them this phrase has been dropped). They have accepted that the currently successful systems need to be undermined because as long as they exist their political "value" system cannot be implemented. Post Modernism allows them to dismiss evidence that contradicts them; as how can that trusted as the "Truth"? Where quite literally you would need to reinvent the wheel to prove to them that a wheel does indeed function (and they would still dismiss it). The problems propagated by the left will never end. Not because politics is ever dynamic, but because they literally are working towards deconstructing our entire society. And yes part of that Fiscal Conservatives is our economy system, property rights (like your right to own), and any sense of capital. Post Modernism also explains why there are so many "very smart" people who seem to be supporting patently proven false systems. I had brought up this point a few times in the past, and the past conclusion we could come to was "Virtue Signaling" and "Useful Idiots". As in someone that allows themselves to be manipulated due to lack of interest or care. But we could never really explain how the intellectual elites that back the left could support it. I mean the only logical conclusion at that point is they are evil (why support a system that causes mass suffering and death?) Post Modernism is the basis in which these people can perpetuate failed policies and systems out to the masses. They have been self deluded by the intellectual trap of post modernism (which by the way philosophers don't even consider a real philosophy because it makes no sense).---Conservatives often joke that the left treats politics like a religion. But it would seem that we aren't far off from the truth in regards to Post Modernism (no disrespect to religious people). Are conservatives seemingly losing the culture war because they keep playing "Whack the mole" in terms of issues the left generates instead of actually tackling Post Modernism head on? If we were able to utterly and thoroughly debunk this mindset in society, would we find this insanity would crumble in upon itself? Why is this mindset appealing to academia? Especially since their entire worth is based on accumulative knowledge of previous generations? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKMwJo9DHUQInteresting 20 minute video from Stephen Hicks on how Marxism evolved into Post-Modernism.Video breakdown:-Marxist predicted capitalism left to its own devices would see the poor/powerless grow as a percentage over time, middle class completely disappear, and the rich decrease to a small few rich powerful people.- All three predictions (even within Marx‚Äôs life) failed. The exact opposite happened. There are less poor, a larger middle class, and a larger ‚Äúrich‚Äù class. This poses a problem as the Marxists envisioned themselves as ‚ÄúScientists‚Äù and that they were predicting the social outcomes as ‚Äúfact‚Äù (I‚Äôm sure we have heard the left do this on millions over other subjects). Their predictive capability was proven in short order to not only be wrong, but was completely disconnected from reality.- Later generations of Marxists made the failed prediction that World War 1 would occur among the Capitalistic nations over resources (not what the conflict was about) and would destroy/weaken each other to the point that Marxism would rise from the ashes.- Great depression they predicted the poor would get their act together and revolt, as the failures were due to greedy capitalists and their excesses.- WW2 they predicted the Fascists and Capitalists countries would destroy each other, and communism would finally rise.- 1950‚Äôs the data is looking absolutely horrible for the Marxists. People are doing over all better in the capitalistic liberal democracies of the West, much more so than their communism competitors. Western Marxists are forced to confront the fact that the Communist nations they so adored had committed vast atrocities/genocide. Up to that point they were still pretending as if these institutions were moral.- Hungary protests put the lie to the communist claim of standing up for the needs and desires of the people. Western Marxists are forced again to confront this reality.- They reform into a ‚Äúnew‚Äù left. They know they have completely failed on all accounts and their philosophy was dead in the water. But they still ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù in the cause. Stephen makes the comparison that this is like a religion for them (which it is). Thus they are really smart, but they still believe in the cause that they know is a proven failure. ‚ÄúCrisis of faith‚Äù.- Thus Post-Modernism is born. Everything we take as ‚Äúfact‚Äù is to be treated skeptically. The facts don‚Äôt support their faith, thus the facts need to go. The Marxist dream was a part of their identity (identity politics showing how powerful it is) thus they must make it happen.- Marxists have decided that politics formulates any final analysis. I take this as they can dismiss any analysis or conclusion that does not agree with their politics.  ----Video does a good job giving a history of the failure of the Marxist ideology and of socialism/communism in general. Stephen does illustrate how there was no way for these smart ideologues to not realize their core beliefs were proven false and how they came to terms with it. On its surface it seems absolutely bizarre for someone who is confronted with the failure of their argument in real life to abandon reason in favor of their cause‚Ä¶ Yet we saw similar sentiment from President Obama.He was confronted with the fact that by every metric the country would be worse off if Capital Gain‚Äôs taxes were increased. Worse off for the poor, the economy, the jobs, the rich, you name it. Across the board the country would be worse off. Obama‚Äôs response to this was that it didn‚Äôt matter, because it was the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing to do. His base and Democrats at large cheered him on for this response. An asinine response, yet the left saw it as brilliant.The ladder half of the 20th century we witnessed very smart people abandon logic, reason, and facts because they saw it as the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing to do. Some religious conservatives have stated that since the left has abandoned religion they have replaced it in other aspects of their lives‚Ä¶ This seems to be more and more evident. The resulting chaos, death, and destruction of such naivete is astounding and obvious. But it doesn‚Äôt matter because it‚Äôs the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing to do‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs ‚Äúfair‚Äù. Seems to be a voice conservatives have been latching onto in the last couple of years. 2 hour+ long interview with Joe Rogan:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04wyGK6k6HERecent Prager U video:https://www.prageru.com/videos/fix-yourself----What are your thoughts on him? He seems to approach many leftist core philosophies from a fairly rational direction and dismantles them. He has a book out that I haven't read. Anyone read it; and what are your thoughts on it? Hope everyone is having a good holiday season. What is one thing politically that you are thankful for this year? nan nan It is clear that we will not be able to roll back leftist programs like the Affordable Care Act easily or at all based on our current political strategies. What are small steps we can take for the next few decades to put us on track towards a more conservative America? How do conservatives slow down/stop the progressive agenda and how do we roll back the devastatingly harmful laws/regulations they have implemented?----Here are some ideas:- Implement congressional reforms like balanced budget amendments that make it incredibly hard for Democrats to implement any new social programs. Seems simple and we can persuade most moderates that all new spending must have cuts/taxes that pay for it. This would essentially hamstring the progressive movement so that they don't do huge pushes like the ACA in the future that are nearly impossible for us to roll back once we regain power.- Implement minor/subtle restrictions to bureaucratic agencies slowly over time to the point that they no longer have any power. Do the same for executive power.- Focus 100% on the courts to ensure originalism reigns supreme and judicial activism dies a quick death. The left's largest political maneuvers have been done through the court system in teh last few decades; this needs to be ended. Republicans already stood up for this last year; they need to continue to do this in the years to come. When the next Democratic president comes along their message needs to be strong and united that judicial activists will not be accepted on the court. Not to sound too much of a tinfoil hat wearer, but does it feel like we're one tiny step away from Brave New World/ 1984/F451? With [Google firing an engineer for "Wrongthink"](http://www.dailywire.com/news/19457/corporate-fascists-google-fires-employee-who-wrote-ben-shapiro) or [Lauren Southern getting booted from Patreon](http://dailycaller.com/2017/07/21/patreon-bans-journalist-lauren-southern-claims-she-will-get-people-killed/) while [Antifa's page remains up](https://www.patreon.com/antifa) or [Twitter bans Sargon of Akkad](http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2017/01/27/twitter-suspends-youtuber-sargon-of-akkad-after-questioning-islamic-migration/) or [YouTube demonitizing conservative videos](http://dailycaller.com/2017/08/11/conservative-and-independent-youtube-channels-hit-by-censorship-and-demonetization/) It just seems to me that we may be living in an "information Golden Age" It's all information that our leftist overlords have deemed "acceptable", What can be done about it? Or am I way off base?  Got into an interesting discussion yesterday on whether Classical Liberals were conservative. I said no but I wanted to know what you all thought. Commonly Attributed "Scientific Statements":1. Neanderthals (Homo neanderthalensis) and humans (Homo sapien sapien) are different species. 2. A fetus/zygote carried by a human woman is not a human. 3. The average world wide climate of the planet Earth was relatively stable until human activity in the 20th century. 4. If a modern scientific body tells us there is a serious problem that will have dire consequences for our country/planet decades or centuries into the future we must take action based on such findings. 5. Evolution is irrefutable. 6. String theory is a solidly founded Scientific Theory with substantial empirical evidence to support it. 7. Dark matter is a well understood in the Scientific Community.----Leftists tend to believe the above statements, and it's not completely their fault as in some cases the media/schools at large have made these appear to be the case.1. False. This like many is a trick question based on how biology is taught in schools. The answer is false. We have been led to believe that they are; as the scientific community likes to give all these different "humans" different scientific names. We even have a different common name for them. Species is defined as: 'A fundamental category of taxonomic classification, ranking below a genus or subgenus and consisting of related organisms capable of **interbreeding**.' We have known for years that interbreeding did occur and scientists have percentages of our DNA they claim are based off of Neanderthal DNA. They have physical differences but modern humans have a vast array of physical differences, that does not make the different 'races' different species. Now I believe the offspring of interbreeding has to be viable; the common example is a donkey, horse, and mule. The offspring is incapable of procreating.2. False. Everyone should have nailed this. There is no doubt scientifically speaking that it is human. It's a human in the earlier stages of development. Leftists will tend to drag this off on philosophical questions of "what is a person", but when dealing with science this is a clear closed case.3. False. This was propagated by Michael Mann's fraudulent hockey stick graph that IPCC reports up to that point contradicted. In the last 10 thousand years we have a half dozen major warming periods, some of which were considered much warmer than today until the hockey stick retconning of history. But even ignoring modern climate, the last inter-glacial period (time between ice ages) is *still* well understood to be warmer than our current temperatures (yes even climate alarmists scientists accept this; they ignore it as they want to claim modern warming is unprecedented and "fast"). Geological history shows the average global temperature of the planet and climate swinging wildly up and down since the beginning of this planet.4. Maybe. It's something we should take into consideration of. When dealing with any data, such as scientific knowledge and technology people like to think they can *extrapolate* where we will be in decades or centuries from now. Extrapolation when dealing with data is a *horrible* prediction method by all metrics. Typically you want to interpolate and even then there are some sizable errors that can be introduced to a prediction using that method. To put simply in the early 20th century it was a huge scientific concern that the cities would be over run with horse manure and that they need to come up with a solution immediately. We know how the horse manure problem was handled. People in the early/mid 20th century thought by the year 2000 all people would have hover cars and the main form of air transportation would be Rigid Airships. This form of terrible extrapolation is further reinforced by science fiction which is why it is so population and such a widely failed perception. We would like to act like we know how things are going to unfold; we are often very wrong.5. False. Evolution is a large body of science encompassing dozens upon dozens of sub-theories. The observable fact of evolution is irrefutable; as we can go observe it happening in many places all over the world in successive generations. Things like human origin theory or origin of life theory have new breakthroughs or discoveries which change nearly every decade. It is common for the left to use a large umbrella to try and pretend as if all scientific theories are solid as the most commonly known ones. Evolution by and large is a good theory; but calling it irrefutable is down right ignorant.6. False. This is more of a philosophical pursuit of some bored scientists that think it provides an explanation for how the universe was created. This is more in the realm of science fiction; yet it has many very smart PHDs bashing their heads against the wall attempting to prove any aspect of it. It does provide some explanations for time and the big bang; but some scientists have competing theories that suggest time isn't even a real thing. At this time this theory is completely baseless and will likely disappear in the next 50 years when all the current scientific egos that have been propping it up die off.7. False. Dark matter is quite literally a fudge factor. It is not a known phenomenon. This is scientists using our understanding of the physical universe to try and "model" the expansion of galaxies and stars and the universe as a whole. When they plugged in the numbers the rates of acceleration and velocity didn't match up at all. Based on their numbers the observed movement of the universe required there to be a substantial amount of mass more than what we currently calculate. So Dark Matter is created, put into their models and suddenly their models seem to match observable trends in the universe. The most likely answer to this is that our current understand of certain physics is flawed or we are missing some other causal effect on the universe (same thing). But in the mean time they will continue to pretend as if everything is alright and that there is a magical invisible matter that exists that makes their theories/understanding correct. This is very similar to Ether. In the 19th century scientists couldn't understand how light could propagate through a vacuum. So they invented a magical medium for space called "Ether" so that their understanding of science was not impeded. ----Feel free to nitpick some of my comments on the subjects above or add your own "scientific" perceived notions that are false. I'm sure there is a whole bunch of things that can be brought up on nutritional sciences as well as psychology.  Can I have like, a general summary because its apparently getting a ton of people up in arms. https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/13/presidential-executive-order-comprehensive-plan-reorganizing-executiveThis is huge. It could very well be the beginning of something spectacular that conservatives have been begging for for decades. Now I don't always say the most agreeable things on r/Conservative, and I say that well in reference to conservatives, but recently, I've received more flack for saying things that are traditionally conservative. Now, it may be that some positions that I have taken recently aren't conservative, but I am fairly certain that, for the most part, what I have been saying is Conservative. This, combined with what I refer to as the r/Politics refugee crisis, and being brigaded every time that a post hits r/all, convinces me that the sub has been pulled left by the influx of non-conservative users.So, is it just what I am saying, and that I have moved right? or has r/Conservative's user base gone leftward? both? nan nan Stream of consciousness:Does the left want this country divided?There was a short time after 9/11 in which the country was united in the fight against terrorism. Democrats suffered historic losses and had very little power within all levels of government. John Kerry was their "military" guy they trotted out to beat Bush and he failed. We saw a paradigm shift and the long forgotten identity politics rose up to the surface.As such this political shift was drastic in terms of tactics. The left went full anti-war (which disappeared when Obama was elected) and they went full on character assassination of president Bush and Republicans. Republicans weren't just wrong, they lied and people died. 9/11 truthers swelled in their ranks. Republicans were evil. Bush was a war mongering evil tyrant that invaded the middle east for oil. Bush was a racist and intentionally didn't help people after Katrina. Etc.We thought that the left would be better once Obama was elected and Bush was gone. That this over the top hatred and rhetoric would die down and we would return to a semi-unified country. Where we could agree upon common enemies and problems. But Obama was 100% of the identity politics movement. He lived for division, and he was a high class troll always putting down his opponents (similar to Trump) every chance he could.One area that stood out to me today on them "wanting division" was the war on terror. At first it was "Hey we don't want to over react guys!" To a complete denial of Islamic Extremism and terrorism. You have to wonder why the intellectual elites of the left decided to go all in to protect the image of Islam. My theory speculates that their strategy is based on division. An external threat unifies people and Democrats found this wasn't good for them politically.Thus in the Obama era every terrorist attack was down played or completely relabeled to "work place violence" or "a reaction to a YouTube video".You might say, "But ultimis what about Russia?" Notice that their use of Russia isn't that Russia is a threat. Republicans have been saying that for over a decade. It's that Russians rigged the election in favor of Trump, or colluded with Trump. It's not an external threat, it's a internal threat that uses an external source.You further see it with any type of mass violence. Muslim extremism was so common and predictable, but the left got angry that the right associated it with radical Islam. Then what we saw was a new narrative formulate in the beginning of the Obama years. The true "violent" faction in the United States is the "right". Notice again, down play and ignore external threats and instead make fellow Americans enemies. This of course fails the utter smell test and screams of hypocrisy based on all the left wing terrorism such as Bill Ayers, but it was an intentional pitting of Americans vs. Americans. Identity Politics.So now any time violence occurs the left has two narrative they immediately push out to all their propaganda outlets: 1.) It was right wing violence based on their "hateful" rhetoric (projecting much?) 2.) It was due to Republicans failure to address our Bill of Rights (either 1st amendment and 2nd amendment which the left clearly couldn't give a shit about). In both cases the real tactic is to attack Republicans and formulate a national narrative that makes conservatives the "enemy". There can't be anything that unites us. National disaster? Republicans voted against X, and are thus out to get people who need that help.Identity Politics was the hallmark of the KKK and the Nazi Party. It starts off as an easy way to rally your base and to "collect" a majority of your population using it. It relies upon fear of opposing groups within a country in order to motivate the political base. As it makes the politics you are pushing personal. If Republicans oppose your healthcare plan, it's because they hate Hispanic people who can't afford healthcare. If Republicans support a ID reform, it's because they hate black people. They are out to get you.External threats like the Cold War act as a unifying mechanism as it gives the country a focus to work towards or against. Such external threats are to be sided with until the Republicans are no longer concerned with them.Identity politics is one of the most evil political operations employed, and Democrats have tapped it to salvage their political foundation. They found themselves irrelevant in 2004, and the radicals of the party remade it into what it is today. Identity politics ultimately leads to bigotry, as how can you not hate someone that is out to get you? When the politics become personal on all issues, then those who oppose your politics are the problem. High levels of bigotry created by Identity Politics leads to wide spread violence and discord, as the "factions" clash with each other. Those who hate due to their "identity" will find the people who they hate start to hate them back. No one likes to be hated or harassed where ever they go.Media has found themselves widely hated by the right, and they pretend to be innocent. "Why do they hate us!?! It must be because of Trump!" Where they have been intentionally targeting and hating on Republicans/Conservatives for decades (more so since 2004).It is so very important that Democrats continue to be repudiated in elections. Moderates need to stop playing the "false equivalency" card as if they allow the left to win or gain power using such rhetorical devices again we face very dark times. Yes on a level of allowing "guilty until proven innocent" as with Kavanaugh. These type of tactics are highly unethical and have very evil outcomes. And while it may not end up like the KKK or the Nazis, the end result will not be pretty or pleasant. The democrats need to be completely squashed into the dirt politically until they reform their political party again.Unfortunately Moderates love to think of themselves as superior because they are of "neither side". So false equivalencies are there go to, and the left becomes more and more rabid. Posted this on r/conservative (one day I‚Äôll get that flair) but it like won‚Äôt see the light of day with the current down vote count.  Y‚Äôall have better more insightful conversations anyway.Generally speaking, I‚Äôm not a big fan of using scripture for government policies but in terms of theology and philosophical arguments I find the scripture below rather interesting.  In several circles, Christianity is normally viewed as being very ‚Äúshare and share alike‚Äù kind of religion.  It‚Äôs normally from this mentality that you‚Äôll hear people claiming the early church is pro socialist.  And while providing to those in need is something Christians are called to do, Paul makes pretty clear that idleness shouldn‚Äôt be tolerated > ‚ÄúIn the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we command you, brothers and sisters, to keep away from every believer who is idle and disruptive and does not live according to the teaching you received from us. For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example. We were not idle when we were with you, nor did we eat anyone‚Äôs food without paying for it. On the contrary, we worked night and day, laboring and toiling so that we would not be a burden to any of you. We did this, not because we do not have the right to such help, but in order to offer ourselves as a model for you to imitate. For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: ‚ÄúThe one who is unwilling to work shall not eat.‚Äù‚Äù‚Ä≠‚Ä≠[2 Thessalonians‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠3:6-10‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NIV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨](http://bible.com/111/2th.3.6-10.niv)I think this the reason I‚Äôve never been a fan of UBI or welfare programs that don‚Äôt prioritize finding employment.  This concept that ‚Äúif they can work, they should do so to earn their own way‚Äù has been known for thousands of years. Yet even today, we have people saying maybe ‚Äúwe shouldn‚Äôt earn our own way‚Äù when others can do so for me.  (Keynesianism I‚Äôm looking at you).  I know I‚Äôm very much preaching to the choir here on this sub, but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been thinking about a lot today and thought it would be good to share. I don‚Äôt know if you all except posts like this. I feel like I must speak the truth and try and get support.An important thing to keep in mind is that I live in a liberal state, which is california, probably the most liberal.Can anyone relate or give me any advice?I have been in the Education system from a very young age about 19 years. I am 25 now, and this is my 14th semester and my 7th year in higher education. I am extremely conservative. You could say a conservative‚Äôs conservative. That‚Äôs not all however. I am really in to politics, been in to it since I was 16. I am also very extroverted/social/outgoing/sociable to a large degree. I am very involved in community, very outspoken, and opinionated. Do you see the problem yet? Add to this I am not quiet about my views. I don‚Äôt think I am not special, fit very well with conservatives, but feel one of a kind here in California. My views probably belongs in Texas or something like that. It‚Äôs not that I want to be unique, but I feel very alone in a sense because my views and who I am stick out like a sore thumb, here. I know I am different because I am so conservative, hold conservative mannerisms, and values.Anyway, I‚Äôve been in higher education classrooms and discussion classes for 7 years now. There are no shortage of Marxist, liberal, progressive, democratic, leftist, left-winged professors. As a conservative this is difficult. Often I don‚Äôt feel like I can share my opinions but do it anyway. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really that valued or appreciated. Sometimes I fear my safety. I tell people being a conservative student isn‚Äôt easy. For example, after trump was elected, I felt like I couldn‚Äôt express myself. This is because so many was so angry and resentful. They say that liberal students have no need to feel unsafe? I feel as a conservative that it‚Äôs more unsafe for us. There is so much violence going on, you never really know if I am next or what these liberal minded people will or may do, or is capable of doing. It‚Äôs often a dreadful thing to listen to these professors lecture the same liberal based lectures. I feel like it‚Äôs dreadful to go to school or even be in school. It‚Äôs a drag. The semester drags me along, unwantingly. It‚Äôs pretty tiring to listen to it day in and day out. I try to be outspoken and respectful. Sometimes though I find the entirity of the class to be a problem. I just try to keep my very conservative views out of it.  I also think a lot of these professors has an agenda. Sometimes I wonder, and the conservative view point on this is what?? I want to learn and I want to be motivated. I know that it is the right thing to do to finish school. The liberalness does make it really difficult. It‚Äôs not like I can‚Äôt speak my mind, but it‚Äôs the push back, dislike, and the other students. You know they just don‚Äôt really like it, they just kind of but they don‚Äôt actively oppose it. The wall of liberal ideas alone is interesting. Stuff they try to do is unfortunate. I feel like I shake my head half the time whilst I am in school. For example, I am taking a class called constitution, law, and society.. In which the loose reading of the constitution, is taken. You know the liberal view of a fluid constitution. You can interpret basically in to it. The whole class revolves around that premise. The devaluing of the consitution that‚Äôs been going on on the left.In that class we‚Äôre also reading a book entitled The Citizen‚Äôs Guide To Impeachment. It is made clear that, we will be discussing the impeachment of trump or if that‚Äôs possible, and why and why not. I am not looking forward to it.Also, in my journalism class, the teacher or rather he‚Äôs the lab assistance he will fill in if the main teacher is gone. Anyway, he made a comment yesterday that went something like, ‚ÄúWhat if we take a picture of dead bodies, maybe it‚Äôll change the direction of our conversation on guns.‚Äù He‚Äôs talking about gun control. It was a journalism class, a passing comment about impact of pictures so I didn‚Äôt challenge him. A lot of times if I say something conservative, talk about my approval of trump or even my support, there‚Äôs noises, rustlings, whispers, ETC...?Some teachers are more open about being liberal/marxist/progressive and some aren‚Äôt. Some covertly support liberal ideas, agendas, or people, and some are more opened.I think you get the idea. I just sometimes don‚Äôt feel very encouraged, included, or liked for who I am, and being conservative is a problem. Can anyone relate or give me some advice, support, ETC... Any ideas of how to foster more discussion on here? I don't really have the time to do large write ups anymore; I had hoped other people would continue to post questions/discussions to keep this alive. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFpYj0E-yb4This is an older Prager U video; but still postulates an interesting question. Is our education system rigged against boys? We hear constantly that everything in society is against girls; but when I was growing up I noticed many female centric teaching styles within school.One of which I recall was my "Spanish" classes in high school. A class where we were there to learn a new language was graded and taught based off of art, singing, and plays. While I personally do have talents in some of those areas, I was fairly annoyed that I had to waste time on tasks completely unrelated with learning the new language. I remember an "art" project where my language execution and vocabulary were perfect. No errors what so ever. But because my art skills were lack luster compared to other students I received a "B" on the assignment.We have statistics across the board showing women are over achieving men in higher education, more undergrads, way more graduate, and more Phds now. So the question is the education skewed too heavily to favor female mentality? Does this suggest a possible move to segregate schools/classrooms based on gender again? We are told that segregation is bad; but in this case does it seem like an appropriate way to fix this issue? Boys and Girls do have statistically different methods of approaching learning; generalizing and grouping them together seems like it will always be sub-optimal. nan nan This poster may not be alt-right; but he has been consistently a huge Trump poster on /r/conservative for the last couple of years.https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/6eusjz/pence_confident_supreme_court_will_uphold_trumps/didp3dv/I have commented before that it is important that we drag them to the Constitution; as while their reasoning for their positions may not be conservative, we can convince them to be conservative as a philosophical foundation for the positions they *currently* pursue.In that above case the Trump support is vigorously against immigration and looks to the founders for inspiration. The alt-right among their numbers are mostly anti-leftists. They are a reactionary movement from the SJW culture war. Many conservatives (on here and else where) have taken a very hostile approach to these upstarts due to giving us Trump... (yes I'm angry about that as well). But we can build upon this to make permanent conservatives out of them.Rule of Law, the Constitution, founding principles are great places for us to keep leading them back to.----What are your thoughts? How many of the alt-right can be intellectually informed? How many of them are truly racist (there are definitely a good chunk)? Has your anger subsided over this group or are you still as angry as ever? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZSQJxc_P4oBill Whittle doing a good job describing conservative (not libertarian) views on what makes a good government.1. Magna Carta. Diversifying the power of government among competing or independent branches. Barons and Kings, to what the founding fathers designed Congress, Courts, Executive, and States.2. Rule of Law. Now one was above the law, law was not an arbitrary execution of some bureaucrat or noble. It is a contract of the people. The left has completely abandoned this and as Gorsuch showed us actively oppose the rule of law.3. Direct democracy is a dangerous and stupid system; though based on a good idea: Power in the hands of the people. A Constitutional Republic provides a system to allow "informed" individuals to make the decisions of government on behalf of their constituents without falling to mob rule and sensationalism (theoretically). Rights are afforded to the states and the people (that the federal government has power over) to limit its ability to act against them in certain ways.4. The bill or rights does not given you any rights. Rights are inherent and unalienable. The bill of rights specifies *Constitutionally Protected* rights in which the government is unable to act against.5. Government is not a player in society, it is a referee. It exists to settle disputes between conflicted parties. It is not a party of its own accord.----Here is some additional discussion on some of the points brought up in the video from above:3.) I recently had a discussion with a friend about this. One of the problems I think we have with modern political discourse is that with the internet and 24/7 news cycle we are micromanaging our elected representatives. We have essentially returned our country to a mob rule type system do to the inherent nature of information and its ability to be manipulated and travel about.A republic is founded on electing people we feel or competent enough to represent our interests at the national level. They will go there and vote in a way they think best suites their constituents. Some times that includes compromising, some times it does not. The fact that all votes are made public means these men and women we put there *cannot* vote their conscience as any decision that maybe considered "unpopular" will quite literally destroy their political careers.President Bush for instance was faced with overwhelming opposition to the Iraqi Surge. Democrats had convinced the country (as they did with Vietnam) to abandon it completely instead of finishing the job. Bush did what he thought was right and follolwed his generals advise; and Iraq was stabilized. This helped to drag his popularity down; but he made the right decision. Obama fucked this up as soon as he got into office; but Bush did what he thought was correct which is why we elect these people.5.) My "Role of Government" post some months back tackled this pretty well. The further removed from the people a government is the less power it has over them. Each level of government exists to settle disputes with those entities beneath them. A state theoretically (does not work this way) should settle disputes between various cities/counties/regions. They also interact on behalf of their citizens with other states and with the federal government (theoretically; and why the Senate should have remained as it was). The federal government acts to settle disputes between the states as well as interfacing with other countries.Bill Whittle example of a stadium full of referees doesn't quite do the situation justice. The federal government dictating laws to the people would be people watching the game on t.v. all over the country telling the 3 players differing rules or how the rules should be done then and there. People far removed from the game are changing the rules and making calls on a play they weren't even there to witness. nan nan We're all conservatives; but share some background on your positions and how you came to them. This will probably remain a small community as those being invited are those who have posted thought provoking posts in the past and care about Conservative positions.So format:1. Give some history. State? Age? What's happening in your life (may be too personal, and this board can be read by anyone).2. How you got to your current political positions? Who was a big influence on those positions (family, great political thinkers, some event in life, etc).3. Your political priorities. What do you think is the most important political subjects at this time and weigh them. Perhaps you care about abortion, but you find immigration to be twice as important.----Please review the sidebar as we have links to an archive of discussions (though it hasn't been updated recently). The recent comments function is useful to track on going discussions that maybe in a week old thread. And we have recently launched a discord server.For submissions we ask that you frame any link as a starting point for a discussion. This is not a news aggregate subreddit. We are here to foster discussion to explore and investigate our conservative philosophies.----Old Introduction thread:[Introduction Thread 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ConservativeLounge/comments/58ercf/introduce_yourself/) I find troubling the current childlike behavior of my friends and fellow ideologues on the Right.I imagine all my fellow conservatives hold in high esteem the notion of honesty, both literal and intellectual.  Additionally, integrity of persons who hold office would be a cornerstone of our values.  Lastly, we espouse the merits of accountability at all levels.  These priorities are shared by most Americans, regardless of ideology: yes, even the Left values the same things we here on the Right value.  Honesty.  Integrity.  Accountability.  These things are universal.What I‚Äôm witnessing though, sadly contradicts these values.  The new *game* is when **dirt** is discovered on someone on our team, the defense is to locate similar **dirt** on the other team.  This isn‚Äôt helpful ‚Äì it‚Äôs childish (the grown up version of ‚Äú*He hit me first.*‚Äù)#Two Wrongs Don‚Äôt Make a RightLet‚Äôs be honest with ourselves.  Trump has an interesting relationship with **honesty**.  Trump flirts with honesty.  Maybe he has an affair with honesty.  Trump does **not** have a meaningful or serious relationship with honesty.  Trump is brutally honest when it serves his objectives.  Trump is occasionally honest on accident (he may not even realize when he begins a sentence, that he‚Äôll end up saying something honest ‚Äì to everyone‚Äôs surprise ‚Äì including Trump himself probably).  I voted for Trump.  I cannot say that Trump is deliberately dishonest.  Trump is honest with himself, which is to say **HE** believes what his says is the "God's-honest-truth" if you asked him.  But we all know that right there is where he gets himself in trouble.   I cannot say that Trump is consciously honest either.  If I‚Äôm honest, Trumps *relationship* with honesty is not a very attractive character trait.  With respects to his administration, clearly the fruit doesn‚Äôt fall far from the tree.The interesting thing (and I believe the reason Trump won) is that Clinton was consciously dishonest (even SHE didn't believe her own crap - and Americans left and right detected her dishonesty - even with herself).As conservatives, I think we should really vociferously **demand** that our elected officials on both sides of the aisle embody honesty, integrity and accountability.  Merely pointing out when others have been dishonest, **does NOT** excuse dishonesty.  Posting about when Elizabeth Warren, or Chuck Schumer or Eric Holder, or President Obama lied, is **not** helpful ‚Äì it‚Äôs childish.  I expect us to be principled conservatives, so when we aren‚Äôt, it‚Äôs embarrassing. As I survey the /r/politics and /r/conservative landscape, this ‚Äú*He called me booger-face FIRST*‚Äù behavior has reached epidemic levels.  While, sadly and cynically, I expect this from the left, I despise those posts here on /r/conservative.Here‚Äôs the problem, conservatives are in control of our government now, and NOW is not the time to behaving like we‚Äôre in the back seat of our parent‚Äôs wood paneled station-wagon.  **Don‚Äôt make me pull this car over!**  Frankly, at this point, I sincerely couldn‚Äôt care less (I want to care less ‚Äì and I can‚Äôt ‚Äì that‚Äôs how little I care) about the lies of **all** the previous administrations.  Don‚Äôt care.  Like I have taught my kids when accusing others of misdeeds, ‚Äú*check yourself first*.‚Äù  We have to fairly examine our leaders, irrespective of the behaviors of even the most extreme of our detractors.  We cannot measure ourselves by the stick of previous administrations ‚Äì that would be, by definition, ‚Äú*The soft bigotry of low expectations.*‚ÄùWhen the Democrats where in charge, I was a fervent believer that where there‚Äôs smoke, there‚Äôs fire.  Not much has changed. ##I‚Äôm NOT espousing anything profound here.  I just thought it should written out as a reminder to everyone (but mostly us here on the right).  This is OUR government **now** and let‚Äôs be intellectually honest with ourselves regarding some of the cronies in Washington on *our team*.  When they‚Äôre dishonest, we have to hold them accountable: not excuse it by pointing to previous misdeeds by opposing ideologues.  We have to question the integrity of persons whom are sworn to be honest, and put themselves in a position to have their integrity questioned.#Let‚Äôs not be willfully dishonest about corruption on OUR TEAM. nan nan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIgZbNNRNOY1. Be aggressive, if you come out overly aggressive tone it down.2. Characterize your opponent in a bad light based on their actions/positions. Obama about Romney: a.) Put dogs on cars, b.) Put you all back in chains, etc. Romney was a "bad mean man". Be ready to point out why they do or support makes them a bad person (as they attempt to do for us). So if they call you a racist, you call them a jackass for calling you a racist without evidence.3. Framing the debate. Reject the liberal framing of the issue at the outset, do not give it any legitimacy as it is nearly always dishonest. (Ben touches on the language control of using "rights" in framing the narrative). It is "morally" deficient is the best line of attack. Quite a few fiscal conservatives don't like making moral arguments, but that is the ultimate way of winning the argument against the left (as it's an emotional argument, efficiency arguments do not win).4. Spot inconsistencies in the left's arguments. They argue from a position of not full communism, which often means they are contradicting themselves often. The left will rarely take the arguments to the full leftist extreme, because it is grossly offensive and they know it. Force them into a consistency, as it will make them reveal their true nature. Shapiro uses the gun control argument to force them to admitting they want all guns banned.5. Force them to answer questions. Don't let them dodge, don't let them go on tangents, hold them to it and call them out when they don't answer. Most people who consider themselves "left" on college campuses really aren't. They just think they are. Asking the fundamental questions will allow them to realize they don't truly hold those positions.6. Similar to 5, don't get distracted. When they attempt to distract from the main issue; vocally "shelve" it to be discussed later and continued on the main topic of discussion.7. If you don't know something, you're allowed to admit it. If they bring up some odd ball fact or topic, be willing to state that you will need to read up on it as you're not familiar with that particular case. Don't pretend you know everything as that is a sure way to look bad and mess up.8. Don't get sucked in by the paradigm. You don't need to defend the paradigm (in his example Reagan). Even though someone is great,  it doesn't mean they didn't make the wrong decisions on occasion. Politics is not a team sport, you don't need to buy into everything your side does.9. Let the other side have "meaningless" victories. They like to use terms without any meaning, don't argue with them on every detail as you can use it against them later. If they ask a vague question you can agree with them (giving them a "victory") but then immediately ask for more specifics or a definition. This will of course trip them up.10. Image and body language (not really relevant to us keyboard warriors). Good posture, animation, etc. Compares Rubio (great) vs. Bush (bad). An image (especially a first impression) can speak a thousand words. So open gestures, good postures, non-aggressive actions are all more appealing to those viewing you.- This is my addition, as Ben only covers 10 points. Adding slight humor to the discussion. I've seen him do this in a lot of monologues. I'm not sure if he does it as often during debates. This generally falls into the "ridicule" aspect of the debate. If you can ridicule your opposition in a way that makes people laugh, even apolitical types or uninformed types will still find it funny. And if they found it funny they will rationalize the target of such ridicule as being less "right". The question is whether or not you should use dishonest ridicule like Jon Stewart made a career of doing (which is highly effective in the culture war).- In his wrap up he says you need to make it fun to argue and debate or it's not worth your time. If you're reluctantly arguing an issue and aren't having fun doing so, it will be apparent to all involved.- In the Q&A he recommends reading Saul Alinsky's Tactics for radicals. Because the tactics are highly effective and the left is using every tool at their disposal to force through their changes.----I haven't read Saul Alinsky and I'm not sure I want to. But I guess it's best to know what tactics are being used against you. A lot of the above tactics are expressed for arenas in which other people are watching. These aren't actually good in a 1v1 discussion with a leftist. nan nan If you have followed my posts on here at all over the last year, I've been working through the problem of immigration and why it is necessary. I will spend some time digging deeper into the subject and a more fundamental flaw of modern Western society.---Introduction----Throughout history a person's "retirement" was based on children. You needed children to be alive and working when you were old so they could take care of you. It also helped as a added economic driver for the family unit. As once your children could do basic chores/tasks they could help around the farm (the majority of work up until the 20th century were agriculture in nature).You had every incentive to have children, as not all of them would survive. But not only that many world religions encouraged it. It was proper and godly to procreate. On top of which sex was a fundamental pass time (in ages pass when darkness necessitated lack of work, procreation was naturally going to occur more).You look at western or "modern" nations of the world and you see a common trend: low birth rates. This is the opposite of what you would expect. Malthusian an 18th century philosopher predicated that human population would rise to meet the necessary food production (or natural resources) of a given area/economy and then tapper off (after famine and death). You see the character Thanos buying into this theory in Avengers: Infinity War completely. He's so convinced by it that he murdered half the universe to advert the lesser evil/suffering if this theory actually panned out. Though Thanos is also known as a Mad Titan who genocided his entire race... so not really a hallmark of rational thought.So you have countries with more wealth and resources than ever before. They have so much "food" their poor are fat. What has happened and why do people in Western society accept this as a good thing? Because they do. It is often touted that this is a natural by-product of an advanced and prosperous nation. There is no reason to accept it as fact, except people's arrogance and the fact they have been *deceived*.Births plummeting----https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/06/30/the-u-s-fertility-rate-just-hit-a-historic-low-why-some-demographers-are-freaking-out/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.2eb92dfe8882https://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?c=us&v=25https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/05/us/us-sees-decline-in-births-for-sixth-year.htmlhttps://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-us-birth-rate-20170630-htmlstory.html>According to the report, the general fertility rate in the United States ‚Äî the average number of babies women from 15 to 44 bear over their lifetime ‚Äî dropped to a record low last year, to 1.86 babies, well below the 2.1 needed for a stable population.Quote is from the 2014 NYT article. The average woman will produce less than 2 children in the United States. That means she will not even replace herself or her partner(s). Which means the population will literally shrink.It is even worse than that. That is the total birthrates for our country. Which is highly supplemented by immigrants who have higher birthrates than the natives. I can't find the study I read, but among 3rd generation + immigrants (meaning people who can trace back their ancestry in the United States for 3 or more generations) is substantially lower than this. If I recall it was around 1.4. As with the quote above you need 2.1 to maintain a population size.Why are people having less children?----Depends on the person.- Economic reasons being a primary driver. There is literally no financial incentive to have children in the society we have built. None. This is an illusion which I will address later in this post, but it's the common perception among our population at large. You have children which cost you a lot of money to have, to raise, to take care of, and to send off to college (which seems like a requirement in this age). You could have used that money to invest and enrich yourself. You could have traveled more, bought that nice luxury car, lived up life, gone back to school, started a business, etc.- Financial stability. People don't feel ready yet for children. We are seeing a rise in people "waiting" to have children. Which on its surface seems wise. Women are more fertile and have less health issues when they are younger. If you wait until you are financially stable, you may only be able to have a kid or two before your time is up.- Feminism. Women are supposed to be men now. This means women are convinced they are supposed to be always working and focusing on their careers instead of their children. This results in women less available and less interested in having babies until it is too late. In the old dichotomy of the family unit, a stay at home mother would consider and weigh if they needed or wanted more children at all times. Now this has been regulated to a minor aspect of their lives where before it was a dominant aspect of their lives. The family unit has no cohesion to hold it together based on how our society is formed now. - Abortion. 1 million babies are aborted every year. This ties into the above reasons. This is just a method of reducing the population, not necessarily people's choices on the matter. Though 95%+ of all abortions are performed are done as a matter of convenience. - Culture. The left since the 1960's has been screaming doom and gloom about overpopulation. This was taught to me in school in the 90's as a fact (I'm sure it's worse today). This includes peak oil, pollution complaining, climate change, you name it. It's all designed to devalue human life. For instance a book written via pseudo science claimed DDT (pesticide) would cause birth defects in pregnant women. So they garnered a movement to abolish the use of DDT which was being used to eradicate the last known out breaks of Malaria (mosquito populations). Malaria rebounded and millions upon millions of people have died, yet these "environmentalists" pat themselves on their backs for killing more people than were killed in the Holocaust. I call it the **anti-human** movement. And you see infect many aspects of our society today.- Religion. Religion has been on the decline throughout the 20th century and until the 21st century. Not only is religious attendance down but so are professed believers. The 20th century had a rise of non-church goers who were still "Christian" and followed some tenants. Millennial and their like don't even bother holding with pretenses. Religion is a social engineering method of getting people to have children and to commit to families. Without this, it's yet another forcing removed from this equation. - There are more such as the undermining of the family unit and gender roles, but I'll leave it there.Why does it matter?----People are happier and richer than ever before, why does it matter if they choose to have no children or very few children? Well part of that is our society is tailored to punish people from having children. Those financial incentives were crushed by the Entitlement State as well as an illusion of financial success (which I will cover later).Our economy literally requires a population that is steadily increasing. Even a stagnate population has its issues, but a population in decline will spell disaster for the people living there. Especially so if you plan to get old and die in said country. You need workers to maintain supply and services. You need workers to literally take care of you when you are older and less capable. You need workers to pay taxes. You need workers to prop up ponzi scheme systems like Social Security.Business have substantial influence within our country as they are an economic force that we can't ignore. They noticed real quick the population problem starting in the 90's. Thus they have been putting pressure on the government to grant more visas and to increase immigration. Big business Republicans like Paul Ryan supported amnesty and more immigration because of the pressure put on them to do so. I don't blame the businesses for this nor the Republicans responding to the pressure as it is a problem for the economy. Paul Ryan even came out last year and told people they needed to start having more babies. Republicans even adjusted the child tax credit to try and offset the burden imposed on families. Businesses aren't going to lobbying for more births as they can't wait 20 years to find workers, they need them now.Economy and progress requires people. The more people the more our society flourishes. Entrepreneurs, great scientists, and good leaders rise up more often as you increase your population. Obviously there is a balance between raw population and infrastructure to support it.It also matters in terms of immigration as brought up before. If one area is seeing a population decline, and other areas are seeing population increases there will start to be a flow of people from one location to another. Be these economic professionals that businesses want or the dregs of society. They will come. People pretending as if we will some how have less crime and less poor people because we sterilize or reduce undesirable peoples population growth are naive a foolish. You will still have poor people, you just displaced your own with those from another society.Even the professional elites the businesses are bringing in to replace the lack of Americans being born, are bringing major baggage to our society. Immigration has historically been low enough that it was easily absorbed by the existing population. As in it was so small, that those immigrants found themselves enmeshed in an American society. While they would maintain some of their culture and heritage they quickly adopted American culture and heritage and the melting pot chugged on forward. These people saw themselves as American, and their children definitely saw themselves as American. And their grand children didn't even really understand their original language/culture anymore besides some artifacts that had been Americanized. Immigrants are coming in with such large numbers and American birth rates have been so low that they are not surrounded by or enmeshed in American culture or values. Especially in the cities where many immigrants are setting up at. You now have people who spend a majority of their lives without interacting with American values. Their children also will spend their lives without these influences.Throw in leftists Multiculturalism which intentionally tries to block immigrants from integrating and joining the "melting pot" and you have a recipe for a larger and larger population that has no connection to being American. Throw in schools, Hollywood, and the media being dominated by the left and these "new Americans" will have nothing in which to melt into. They are being fed Marxist propaganda in substantial portions of these areas without any contrast.California has a population of 40 million people, 10 million of those people were not born in the United States. Even more of them are the children of those 10 million people, who grew up hearing leftist propaganda and having no American culture in which to contrast it to. California a once all American state is now a leftist shithole. And it has nothing to do with Americans there deciding far left policies were a good idea.Fundamental Transformation----Democrats have gone all in on supporting not only mass immigration into the United States, but Abortion and even illegal immigration to the 11th degree. Demographics is much more than just a changing population. It's literally them attempting to replace Americans with enough non-culturally rooted transplants that they can fundamentally transform this country.Some conservatives fear balkanization. I don't think this will occur, as the left is uniting these masses into a coherent anti-American force. Yes tribal politics does lead to infighting, and this may occur after conservatives and American ideals have been crushed into nothingness. But that's a problem we will unlikely see or even care about even if we do (as the whole country will be a shithole).Freedom of speech, Freedom of Religion, Innocent until proven guilty, an objective and fair media, diversity of views, etc are all going out the window. Values we took for granted are no longer valued. Socialism is on the rise. These are not coincidences, they are connected to the above problem. Your culturally rooted population is in decline (by a lot). Those who are not culturally rooted are intentionally isolated, indoctrinated, and brought in at such numbers that it literally would be impossible for them to share American values unless it was by chance (as in they came from a country that also has those values).Things will Work themselves Out----No, they won't. The American Great experiment is not the default human condition. Human liberty, responsibility, and checks and balances not only rarely existed in history... it also rarely exists in our modern world. Some of you might say "Well hey, immigrants are going to have our values. A lot of them coming from Latin America are Christian!" Those who are immigrating here are doing so for economic reasons. Regardless Christianity existed for 1700 years before the Classical Liberal movement was founded. While it was a huge influence on the movement, it did not necessitate our outcome. Even demographically similar countries like Canada and Britain arrested people for bad speech, block religious expression, ban all guns, and have very restricted "correct thinking". An average immigrant from either of those countries to the United States will likely not share our values.Tyranny and oppression is the default human condition. Most of human history had slavery, it was the classical liberals via the British Empire that brought down the bulk of it. Today human trafficking acts as slavery and the left supports it full throttle. Classical liberal values defining a society like the United States was an experiment. And while we are a shining beacon to the world, if it is extinguished it will unlikely return any time soon.Fiscal conservatives will watch as proven failed systems like Socialism and Fascism take over, and will be scratching their heads on why it happened. They have been duped into thinking social issues are a religious fuddy problem that is backwards and anti-progressive (as in they don't realize progressives are actually regressive on nearly every front).Overpopulation----Obviously not a problem in the West. We have the opposite problem. Even if you believe we are approaching our sustainable human population levels and action is needed, you should understand that policies killing Americans or reducing our population will have zero affect on it. Unless countries who implement population control measures also shut down immigration, all you have done was replace your population and culture with a different one. Congratulations? You have reduced the stresses on the origin country, and their behavior will not change. Mean while India is pushing towards 2 billion people and is chugging along.Overpopulation is a theoretical concept that is dependent on hundreds of factors. If you think you have done the research to know when and how it will occur, you are likely lying to yourself. Peak Oil? Food? Land? Not only are these things far from tapped, there are alternatives that you have not considered or haven't even been discovered yet. Such predictions rely upon you using the current environment for the world and thinking it will remain like that in 100 years. For example in the early 20th century they though the primary form of air travel would be some sort of blimp or rigid dirigible. The car wasn't even invented. They thought their cities would be over flowing in horse manure as so much was being generated.Predicting the future based off of current technology and economic practices completely devalues human ingenuity and adaptiveness. And there won't be some sudden failure that will result in a huge collapse and massive death (outside of war or a huge natural disaster). When resources become limited, you see changes in use of those resources or new resources being exploited.Is there a limit to how many humans could live on Earth? Comfortably? Yes. Do I think any person alive today could actually know what that limit is? No. Should we act upon a unknownable limit to our population because we know there has to be a limit? No. We know an extinction level event asteroid will crash into the Earth again. Happens roughly every 100 million years. We don't know exactly when it will happen, but it eventually will. Should be build a massive missive defense platform system around our planet for that eventual day? No. It could happen in a year or 10 million years. Do you think the resources required to deflect such an asteroid will be greater or lesser in 10 million years? Tackling problems with no definable date with current technology is a horrible idea. As you divert resources from other endeavors and other progress at a substantial cost to our society.Like the asteroid, overpopulation should be studied, tracked, and researched. But acting upon it in any meaningful way within our society is just down right stupidity. Address the problems you can identify with accuracy and precision, with the highest risk (which includes damages and probability of occurring). If you have no real idea of when something is going to occur and you are diverting large quantities of resources to address it... You have just robbed something that had greater need of the resources it required to be addressed.The Great Illusion----The premise of this post and a realization I had recently. Having less children does not make you better off. Building up your financial assets, putting more money into retirement, social security all make one think they don't need children. They are dead wrong.Children are necessary for society to even function. Hey you made 1 million dollars extra by not having a child. The lower population results in a depreciation in assets, value, and work force. Thus you pay more for services when you get older.Hey we solved that by just importing people from other countries, thus alleviating the stresses on those countries resulting in them continuing to give birth at high rates! Meaning you sold the future of your country, the values that have made this country great in exchange of living slightly more comfortably. What do you care, you will live comfortably until you die. It depends on how much those values change. Racism is on the rise via tribal politics. Historically this type of rise is followed by purges and genocides. How comfortable do you think you will be?People who have no children or few children are relying upon others to carrying the financial burden of raising our future. They are leeches (no matter how much money they are making). Even if you are not religious, it is your personal responsibility to ensure the good morals and values are society has prospered on are continued into the future. You are not better than a person who inherits a large fortune and squanders it on gambling and drugs. It's narcissism. And our society is designed to encourage narcissistic types of behavior for the pass half century. It's a form of social Socialism, as in the people who give the most to the future share that prosperity with those who do nothing for the future. Thus further deincentiving those who do the most work.The Path Forward----Obviously abolishing abortion will go a long way to addressing this problem. Even ignoring the moral problems with abortion (which are abhorrent), abortion should be completely outlawed to plug a hole in this sinking ship. This is not a lasting solution, only a patch.There needs to be public policy to encourage people to have children. Perhaps compensation for stay at home parents (mother or father).A cultural push to value human life again. Every life has value and should be protected within reason. Murder is seen as one of the most horrific crimes in a society, and that has to do with the human life taken. This needs to be expanded. If people in general are not religious, we need to have a larger emphasis in education praising life and birth. Children are our future, they are not a prop to be used for politics (as the left does).This can't be a small aspect of our movement. Pro-life needs to be more than just opposing abortion (yes it's horrible). Opposing abortion should be a sub-bullet of the agenda. The fundamental flaw with socialism is that it can only exist in opposition to human nature. People are not altruistic worker bees.Socialism is the public ownership and/or control of the means of production.    * Phase 1: The Welfare State.  Income redistribution through high taxes, free healthcare, free food, free shelter, free college, generous retirement pension, guaranteed income, high government regulation, high government employment, government policies that favor equal results over equal opportunity.  The Welfare State works for a generation or two. Most cultures favor hard work and see taking government handouts as an embarrassment or even as a form of stealing from your fellow citizens who do work and pay taxes. However, the longer the Welfare State is in place that cultural attitude tends to shift.  First welfare becomes acceptable and eventually taking everything you can from the government while contributing as little as possible is eventually seen as your "right".Once the government sector grows to the point that the private sector starts to shrink the downward spiral cannot be prevented.  The majority of people either work for the government or are dependent on welfare.* Phase 2: "The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money." ~Margaret Thatcher  With a shrinking private tax base and growing government dependency the Welfare State begins to fail. Borrowing, increasing taxes, and confiscating wealth no longer solves the problems. Government rationing begins, pensions are cut, pay is reduced, retirement and savings accounts are confiscated, collectivism and redistribution are strongly enforced. This leads to the beginnings of civil unrest.  The only hope is for strong austerity measures and a shift away from the welfare state and towards free markets.  The problem is that the masses have been raised to believe they have a natural right to the free ride the government has been providing.  They are entitled to health care, food, shelter, and education.  Somebody owes them and if the government won't provide then it must be corrupt.  They won't accept that the way of life that worked for their parents was doomed to end, regardless of how many times the cycle has repeated throughout history.* Phase 3: Government collapse or Totalitarian Oligarchy.  Hyperinflation.  Protests and riots.  Starvation.  People leaving the country as refugees.  Either the government will collapse and be overthrown or the elite will decide that the problem is the people.  Order will be enforced through force. "Dissenters" and "trouble-makers" will be rounded up to be either imprisoned or killed. Loyalty to the ruling party will be strongly rewarded. Government will control every aspect of your life. Nationalist propaganda will be everywhere. Scapegoats will be identified to distract the public and focus their anger away from the Government.What starts as an altruistic fantasy to help the less fortunate once again leads to far greater suffering. I'm a conservative high school Asian girl in California (identity politics, I know, bad) and I can't stand all the stuff we do in class--and people debate me because of it. For example, in AP Spanish class, we have to watch and analyze a 16 minute long video about how masculinity is harmful to both men and women and perpetuated in society. My teachers have "safe space" and "no human being is illegal" posters in their classrooms.Today a girl asked me if I was a feminist because of comments I said against that video in my Spanish class. I said no and she asked why. I explained the 3rd wave feminism thing and told her that I was for equality and that there aren't any laws discriminating between men and women. She said that laws that women can't be topless in public and men can--which is true--but that's a terrible idea, but I can't explain to her why. Also, she said that birth control is only a woman thing? and that lots of women can't get it and it's a RIGHT? which is so not true but also that men totally have condoms as birth control...One of my other peers told me that we should have universal healthcare and that we already are socialist--because we have public and private institutions and stuff and that's the definition she learnt in history class. An adult volunteer that came from the local library gushed about having every character as trans in a fanfic she read and said that "I want universal healthcare because I can't pay for my health insurance!"Each year we are required to attend a three-day-long lecture and activity program teaching us about 1 in 5 women in college get raped and about "yes means yes" consent and that sex isn't gender, and run programs and activities to have us "practice yes means yes consent". It's like indoctrination.I have trouble refuting people's views strongly and accurately and tell them that seriously, that's wrong! Any tips? Also, how do I put up with this? there aren't any conservative clubs on campus and the annoyance is constant. What ends up happening whenever I get into a discussion with someone where I disagree is I feel like I come out looking like an idiot and the other person just thinks I'm  stupid and misinformed because I don't end up sounding coherent in my arguments and because everyone else around them agrees with them and has never really given them a opposing view. nan nan After a week of reddit manipulation to push these stories on nearly every subreddit; we can open a discussion here about it. Here are some "conservative" arguments in favor of Net Neutrality:- Internet providers are essentially monopolies. Thus they are held to a higher regulatory/public control. (Seems like a convenient way to implement fascism.) The argument by some is that due to the nature of infrastructure it's a natural monopoly like water or electricity, thus the government needs to be involved to keep them "in check" to not abuse that monopolistic power.- It will help to protect "freedom of speech". Not from the government; but from corporations. Without free market competition these entities can get away with blatant abuses to squash competitors and speech that they do not like and there is very little action consumers can take against them as internet has become "essential". They point to abuses by leftists organization like Google/YouTube and Facebook as an example of this.----What are some conservative arguments in favor of it? What are arguments against? I am personally against Net Neutrality. I do support anti-Trust moves against companies acting in monopolistic fashion (like Google). nan Short post by me. Reading about Howard Zinn:https://newrepublic.com/article/112574/howard-zinns-influential-mutilations-american-historyShows that even history has political activitists attempting to control "facts" by re-writing our history.Are there any institutions left that the leftist have not completely corrupted with their politics? The following is an interesting TED talk by Jonathan Haidt:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SOQduoLgRwPlease watch the video; 18 minutes long roughly. Below I have a break down of some of the points made in the video with some extrapolation on my part. Feel free to respond to some or all of them.----Interesting points brought up in video:- Stereotypes are real; and they can be used to understand or predict behavior.- Leftists are more open to experience new things; where conservatives are more interested in staying within the known.- The lack of moral diversity of the TED organization results in a lack of diversity of thought and defeats the purpose of what they are trying to achieve.- He throws in the Jon Stewart humor about "fly over country" and gets the effect that he was looking for from the predominantly leftist audience. A complete lack of understanding of the opposition by leftist. He calls this this "Moral Matrix" as they are trapped within their delusions and are incapable of perceiving the other morality. Interestingly he uses "Red Pill" as a eye opening experience; this was posted in 2012 so this long predates the alt-right meme and is a reference to the Matrix movie.- He suggests that even a baby with no experience actually has some "nature based" moral framework or mind in which to work from. Across all cultures and history he pieces together 5 foundations of morality of what is default for the human perception:1. Harm/Care. A dislike or innate harm and desire to care for the defenseless.2. Fairness/Reciprocity. Justice. Fair treatment. Treat others as you would like to be treated.3. In Group Loyalty. Families, nations, states, sports teams, political parties.4. Authority/Respect. Rule of Law. Hierarchy. Appreciation for others and what they do.5. Purity/Sanctity. About what you do with your body. About what you put into your body.- He shows several graphs based on "left" vs. moderate vs. conservative over several countries. In those he shows that the left is inherently a 2 channel moral foundation of Harm and Fairness. Where the more conservative one gets they are a 5 channel moral foundation. BTW this purely about **social** identification; social issues.- I'll take a moment to state that "morals" is essentially a system of values. What do people who identify as conservative socially value?- Social atrophy. There is a fear of this break down of order and stability; and arguably many "new conservatives" or "Trump conservatives" are a part of this moral value system.- Cooperation naturally decays among humans. (My own extrapolation) Why socialism and communism ultimately fail in their ventures. Their experiment demonstrates that punishment is the only means of keeping people in line and in order. Thus why Fascism and Communist states looked like they did.- Makes the argument that human success requires all 5 moral groups to be valued.- Conservatives want order and respect the institutions even if there is a cost to those at the bottom. I would agree to an extent. We value fairness and equal opportunity; but we also value Rule of Law. We are not willing to throw out Rule of Law if there is *some* inequity going on. We will look for a way to address that inequity within the Rule of Law. The left on the other hand has the "Ends justify the means" approach to fairness as they do not value you Authority/Respect nor do they value In Group Loyalty.- He makes the case that the Left and the Right need each other and are not in opposition. I disagree with this. He has made the case that the left has completely abandoned 3 of the 5 moral foundations. That is a problem.- The last few minutes he seems to fall off of his message here. Clearly he is talking to the predominately leftist audience and he doesn't want to end on a message that "You are all wrong". He has created a moral equivalency and even throws a jab at Bush. Which in 2012 was still a target of the Bush Derangement Syndrome.- He uses a persuasive argument; which is leading the audience with a moral position. "You are passionately committed to making the world a better place and you are passionately committed to the truth thus:". This is a good way to persuade someone to a certain position. You feed their feel good center about themselves and insinuate that they will accept the message due to their innate goodness and moral agenda. Pretty clever.----This is a non-religious break down on morality. But even though he is probably agnostic/atheist he seems to be pro-religion in that regard. Do you agree with the 5 moral foundations? Does this explain why the left thinks conservatives are inherently evil? If they don't understand or even accept 3 of the 5 moral foundations then they can't understand why you would oppose their agenda.Is it fair to state that the left does not have such moral foundations? Haven't they clearly substituted them? In Group Loyalty is to race. Sanctity for them is consumption and privacy. Authority is academia (they use arguments to authority often).This break down does support my position that the more ignorant you are on social issues the more likely you are to be a social liberal. A social conservative needs to understand and have a much broader moral value system; a leftist does not. Could this also explain why as people get older the more conservative they become? nan What are your "values" and how would your prioritize them? Why do you value them? How do you resolve valued things that are in conflict?These are important questions for any person in life. Not a lot of people fully understand them. In some cases you maybe religious and you automatically accept a set of values; but do you know "why" you value them? Shapiro makes the case in debates that referring to a religious argument of authority isn't necessary nor is it effective. The reason being is that God's commandments and teaching do makes sense in a fundamental manner (as in you should understand why God states it is good or bad) and your opponent may not respect your argument to authority.Are there a national set of values? "American" values. Shapiro refers to these as Judeo/Christian values. Do agree that such national value exist? Or did they once exist and are lost in modern culture?When teaching values; who is the proper source? The parents (who are too busy working to properly set these)? The schools (that are politically influenced, and are already under performing on educational standards)? The Church (not everyone is religious, such an assumption leads large portions of our communities incapable of understanding basic values that we all share)? Should there be specific values taught in regards to "national" values to ensure everyone shares them via schools? Patriotism, Liberty, Life, and Rule of Law?In past threads I talk about the evils of "diversity of values". The idea is that not all values are equal, but not only that a population made up of diverse values are more likely to enter into conflict. Should a state/nation have an homogeneous set of values for the most part? Or at least common values that they share?----Feel free to take a crack at any of the questions. No need to address all of them. I often find the need to have a discussion on values with people on reddit as they don't understand human decision making process. It isn't as arbitrary as some political groups attempt to make them. If you understand your values specific actions/inactions can be definitively described as wrong. How have Republicans been winning recent elections? We won with Trump, across congressional/senate elections and special elections. I have heard two competing theories (though there may be more) for why this is: 1. Voter turnout and motivation. You stick to your bread and butter and get your base to turn out in numbers. Obama was really good at getting Democratic demographics out to vote when he was running while Romney had the opposite effect for traditional Republican demographics. Getting your key demographics out to vote in good numbers.2. Getting disenfranchised voters to ‚Äúflip‚Äù to your party. Trump claimed that many former Democrats crossed party lines as that party no longer represents them. Some of these line crosses call themselves JFK Democrats, who the party has abandoned. So we know voter turnout was lower in this last election than 2012. So number 1 was clearly at play; but you could argue both sides were affected by this. There was significant anti-Trump feelings in the Republican party. But at the same time there are a significant amount of disenfranchised voters in the Rustbelt that felt that Democrats had abandoned them. ---- To what extent did either theories play a role in recent election victories for Republicans? Should Republicans be looking to ‚Äúflip‚Äù demographics or should they work on motivating their base. How effective is it for the party to try and demoralize the opposition? Republican losses in 2009 were massive due to a demoralized right that had lost faith in their leadership. How fickle are the ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù? Can they be won over; or will they be that consistent pendulum that pushes us each direction every decade or so? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wsbQSUPm-E Crowder and Prager touch up on a series of cultural issues facing us and it‚Äôs amazing how much I‚Äôm in sync with Prager and Crowder (outside of Prager U I never listen to his radio show). Here are some of my thoughts on the video: -Gender debate is directly tied to the gay marriage debate. If people can just ignore gender in one and basic definitions of institutions they can do it elsewhere in life. The left claimed it was a slippery slope; but it took less than a decade To realize they were full of shit. -There are larger numbers of young people who realize western culture is under attack and could be utterly destroyed if the left has their way. These people we call ‚Äúreactionary‚Äù (possibly alt-right). They are less interested in specific political positions or philosophies; but are trying to conserve the culture that this nation was founded on. It‚Äôs an interesting group. Do we call them ‚ÄúCultural Conservatives‚Äù? How are they different from Social Conservatives? Are they the new Social Conservatives of the new generations (millennials and generation z)? As a Social Conservative myself I hope not; but that doesn‚Äôt mean the issues can‚Äôt align. -Woody Allen apparently has some great movies; some of which have very conservative messages. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen any of his movies. Both Crowder and Prager raved about several in this clip. They also discuss how the art an artist produces can actually exceed what the artist was attempting and that you need to be able to differentiate between the art and the artist. I have long boycotted John Depp do to hate of the actor himself; not the art he produces. Others far left artists like Dicaprio I tend to ignore their personal antics in favor or enjoying the art they produce. -The title of the video is covered in the discussion at the very end of the video. People are not ‚Äúbasically good‚Äù by default. We as a society should work towards making people better or ‚Äúgood‚Äù; but assuming that all people are good is a serious problem. As then it opens the door for deflection and lack of personal responsibility. Similar to the post I made recently about ‚ÄúCrazy‚Äù. The assumption is that person must be good; and thus their actions mean they were just crazy. ---- They covered several other topics and it‚Äôs worth a watch. Prager University has been very successful in the culture war and engaging younger people in this country. i've been wrestling with this question all morning.  like you, i've been watching some people on reddit condone the shooting because "GOP policies were going to kill 23 million americans."  high profile celebrities and media people have promoted (or produced) violent, anti-GOP imagery or expressed the desire for violence.to me, these seem to be important differences from previous examples of violence against politicians, but i'd like to get a conversation going.  i think it's important to contextualize what happened this morning within the history of violence against political figures in this country and *violent rhetoric against political figures* in the past, both to better understand what happened and to better engage the left.a related question is, **to what extent can we say that this shooter represents the left?**  i often say that one data point does not a trend make.  but this shooting comes after violent protests in many cities, riots against conservative speakers, and antifa attacks on peaceful right-wing protesters.  viewed one way, the shooting this morning is an example of a rare phenomenon in this country; viewed another way, it's the latest escalation in a trend that has been developing since the end of the Obama presidency.finally, i think it's important to ask: **to what extent does speech** cause **anything?**  this is critical, because if we now agree that speech causes violence, then what is the responsible course of action, policy-wise?  do we ban violent video games and crack down on rap music?i have some answers but they're not fully formed.  i'm hoping that some of your comments will help me see this from more sides and develop a well-rounded, carefully thought out, intellectually honest, non-partisan, *principled* understanding on what is taking place in this country.  EDIT 2: related question: **why and how has the framing of people on the right as fascists been produced rhetorically?** as i think through this, i think that's an important piece of this. perhaps one piece of a reciprocal causation or at the very least a necessary cause of what happened this morning.EDIT 3: to what extent is what happened today caused by the media environment in general, where people choose what media they will follow and become isolated into media bubbles/echo chambers/safe spaces?  is this happening on the right as well as on the left?EDIT 1: types of causation (from Lunsford & Ruszkiewicz, Everything's an Argument 7th ed., p. 251):* sufficient cause: enough for something to occur on its own* necessary cause: required for something to occur (but in combination with other factors)* precipitating cause: brings on a change* proximate cause: immediately present or visible cause of action* remote cause: indirect or underlying explanation for action* reciprocal cause: one factor leads to a second, which reinforces the first, creating a cycle nan Posting this up early. If you wish to talk about his testimony live or after the fact please post here. Posts here do not need to be high quality as this can be done in a live fashion as it is happening. nan nan nan nan nan A lot of conservatives, myself included, think the TrumpCare/Swampcare/RyanCare bill needs serious "work" if we're to view it as a "starting bid".This is kind of an open question, but I guess my question is: what is the bare minimum needed for you to get on board?Alternatively, this is kind of an "imagine you're one of the members of the Freedom Caucus or a conservative member of the Senate" sort of deal.  What, in your view, would need to happen for you to vote for the bill?Here's a list of "failures" as I see them, based on what I've been reading.  If you have something else, please address it.- Trump's "No more lines around the states" are still in there.  Bad.- They've replaced some subsidies with tax credits, which you can claim even if your taxable income is below that amount (I.e. Subsidies paid on April 15th).  Bad.- Individual mandate has now switched from "you owe the government money by law" to "you owe a private insurer money by law".  Bad.- Really doesn't do that aggressive of a job in terms of lowering costs.  Bad.- The "death spiral" in terms of preexisting coverage: still there.  You can wait until you're sick to get coverage and insurers pass the cost onto the consumer and the taxpayers!!! Yay!!!  (Bad.  This is bad.)- Bumps up Medicaid and creates 100 billion in new state subsidies.  Bad.- It's backed by both Trump and GOP leadership with vague promises of "phase 2" that doesn't even address some of the chief concerns.  Kind of like how that border fence got built as phase 2 of an immigration package that included amnesty.  Bad. Everyone has a different perspective on this; so I figured this is a good thing to discuss. How do Fiscal, Social, Neo, and Libertarian Conservatives fit into that? And what do each of them mean? And where do you find yourself?Some of you don't view "Trump Conservatives" to be conservatives. How do we sway them towards conservatism? They have particular interests that drove them to Trump can Milton Friedman or Clarence Thomas help to make them "real" conservatives? nan nan nan Keep in mind that we can't give up a Senate seat unless it's sure to go to a Republican.Cabinet Positions:    * **Secretary of State**  * **Secretary of the Treasury**  * **Secretary of Defense**  * **Attorney General (Department of Justice)**  * **Secretary of the Interior**  * **Secretary of Agriculture**  * **Secretary of Commerce**  * **Secretary of Labor**  * **Secretary of Health and Human Services**  * **Secretary of Housing and Urban Development**  * **Secretary of Transportation**  * **Secretary of Energy**  * **Secretary of Education**  * **Secretary of Veterans Affairs**  * **Secretary of Homeland Security**    Non-Statutory Cabinet-Level Positions:   * **White House Chief of Staff**  * **Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency**  * **Director of Office of Management & Budget**  * **Ambassador to the United States Trade Representative**  * **Ambassador to the United States Mission to the United Nations**  * **Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers**  * **Administrator of the Small Business Administration**   I'm speechless.  Consider this the official happening thread.  I may just have to make a Doom Paul emote for the sub to commemorate. Relevant Laws----Terms:Knowing - conscious; intentional; deliberate. Not a mistake or accident. Aware of their actions.Intent - (law definition) the state of a person's mind that directs his or her actions toward a specific object.Willfully - deliberate, voluntary, or intentional. Was not coerced or forced.18 U.S. Code ¬ß 1924 - Unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material>(a) Whoever, being an officer, employee, contractor, or consultant of the United States, and, by virtue of his office, employment, position, or contract, becomes possessed of documents or materials containing classified information of the United States, **knowingly** *removes* such documents or materials without authority and with the **intent** to retain such documents or materials at **an unauthorized location** shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.The above law requires "knowing". The concept being that if you accidentally leave a classified document in your rental car you wouldn't be sent to prison over it. Clinton definitely knew what she was doing with that information, but she claims she didn't know the information was classified. The absurdity of such a statement I will discuss below under "Original Classification Authority" section. She intended to host those files on her personal server there is no doubt and there is no way she thought the server was authorized.18 U.S. Code ¬ß 798 - Disclosure of classified information>(a) Whoever **knowingly and willfully** *communicates*, furnishes, *transmits*, or otherwise makes available to an unauthorized person, or publishes, or **uses in any manner prejudicial to the safety or interest of the United States** or *for the benefit of any foreign government to the detriment of the United States any classified information*‚Äî>(3) concerning the communication intelligence activities of the United States or any foreign government;>Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.Again she knew what she was doing. Was she forced into using this insecure sever? She and her defense would need to show that, but no. So this was is if she knew that hosting files on a server in her bathroom maybe bad for the interests of the United States and does risk our sensitive information be leaked to our enemies. Again she was a "Original Classification Authority" on top of which every person who deals with classified information is *required* to take training in the proper handling and disposal of said material.18 U.S. Code ¬ß 2071 - Concealment, removal, or mutilation generally>(a) Whoever **willfully and unlawfully** *conceals*, *removes*, mutilates, obliterates, or *destroys*, or *attempts to do so*, or, with **intent** to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in **any public office**, or with any judicial or **public officer of the United States**, shall be *fined* under this title or *imprisoned not more than three years*, or both.>(b) Whoever, **having the custody** of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, **willfully and unlawfully** conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and **shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States**. As used in this subsection, the term ‚Äúoffice‚Äù does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.The first section requires intent; section b shows that she was in position of the record/article and no longer needs intent for the crime. She just has to have done it. Section gives up to 3 years of time in prison and bars the person from holding any office. This seems to be the most damning one for Comey not to recommend indictment. -----There were other laws that she violated such as the FOIA, though those don't really carry a sentence within the law. But arguably a court could try her and bar her from office for such a violation.-----Original Classification Authority----https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/executive-order-original-classification-authorityUnder the Obama administration there were 21 people in total (throughout the entire U.S. government) given this authority. All other members of the federal government are called "Derivative Classifiers". Derivative classifiers have to follow the guidelines of someone like Secretary of State in terms of how they do their markings and handle the information. This means Clinton in her position would have receive *significant* training on classification and what **should be** Secret and Top Secret (even derivative classifiers get this training, that way if they come across something they can escalate it up to be reviewed).A rule of thumb for classification: If *this* information is released to the public how harmful would it be to the United States or its interests? So often technical performance specs of weapons and war systems will be at the Secret Level and sometimes Top Secret Level (there are things higher than this, but they still fall within the Top Secret category). How about intimate knowledge of Putin having an affair in his get away ranch? Seems harmless enough? Except the source of that information might be an operative at the highest level of the Russian government. If that information was leaked public the source would be found and killed. So not only would someone die, but the United States would lose crucial source of inside intelligence. That would easily be Top Secret, even though the information may seem harmless.Clinton defenders claim some of the information was "public knowledge". While this *may* be true, that doesn't actually change the classification. The United States puts out a lot of misinformation about our systems and procedure; so that way when someone leaks the reals stuff it's hard to tell which is the truth and which is the misinformation. To have Clinton confirm procedures and intel in a unclassified medium is a complete violation of the law.----I have yet to meet a person who has a security clearance who has thought Clinton hadn't broken any laws. It is blatantly obvious to anyone who has dealt with this stuff that she should be jail. And if she wasn't a *privileged* (truly relevant term here) political class, she would already be tried and convicted.So what do you guys think? Why didn't Comey recommend an indictment? Do you think that the DOJ told him that it would interfere with the election too much, and that they should wait until after the election? I saw that as the excuse from the DOJ crying about his letter to congress. Though this seems to ignore that Bush Senior was falsely indicted 1 week before the 1992 election over the Iran-Contra scandal that seemed to throw the election to Clinton. From the [Washington Post:](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/10/26/cruz-says-theres-precedent-for-keeping-ninth-supreme-court-seat-empty/)>LOVELAND, Colo. ‚Äî Speaking to reporters after a campaign rally for a Republican U.S. Senate candidate here, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) said that there was ‚Äúprecedent‚Äù for a Supreme Court with fewer than nine justices ‚Äî appearing to suggest that the blockade on nominee Merrick Garland could last past the election.>‚ÄúYou know, I think there will be plenty of time for debate on that issue,‚Äù said Cruz, when he was asked whether a Republican-controlled Senate should hold votes on a President Hillary Clinton‚Äôs nominees. ‚ÄúThere is certainly long historical precedent for a Supreme Court with fewer justices. I would note, just recently, that Justice Breyer observed that the vacancy is not impacting the ability of the court to do its job. That‚Äôs a debate that we are going to have.‚ÄùPersonally, I side with Senator Cruz on this.  I think there are good reasons to be [suspicious of Garland.](http://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/432716/moderates-are-not-so-moderate-merrick-garland)  It is my hope that Republicans somehow manage to keep a majority in the senate, so that they can force whichever unqualified worm that makes it into office to appoint a "boring" originalist justice who will refuse to legislate from the bench.A guy can dream.Here's a fairly [pessimistic opinion](http://hotair.com/archives/2016/10/26/ted-cruz-confirming-clintons-justices-just-shrink-supreme-court-know/) on all of this from Hot Air, if you're into that. Since Obama took office, Republicans have gained:  12 governorships  14 senate seats  69 house seats  910 state legislature seats  I think the damage being done is mainly to the national Republican brand with not nearly as much damage to the State and Local brands.For decades there has been a tug-of-war between the socially/fiscally moderate-to-liberal Republican establishment and the socially/fiscally conservative Republican base.    Donald Trump doesn't fit into either of those categories.  Trump is a nationalist populist.  People trying to understand him through the traditional prism see chaos.  He appears to jump wildly from position to position, but he has been a consistent nationalist populist.Trump's supporters represent a coalition of anti-immigration nativists/economic protectionists who were previously unrepresented in the Republican Party except for by rare individuals such as Pat Buchanan (who switched to the Reform Party and was much more of a paleoconservative than Trump).**The conservative base faction:**  Consists of ideologues who will consistently fight to be represented by someone who will fight for their principles.  There is a small threat of a 3rd Party challenge and Republican Party split if Donald Trump wins the nomination, but it would have to be led by a major Republican with significant backing.  The most likely scenario if this were to happen would be a Ross Perot style single election flameout, but with decades of bad blood between the base and the establishment it could turn into a permanent split.**The Republican establishment faction:**  Has first, second, and third priorities of protecting their existing power structure.  Donald Trump is unlikely to threaten the establishment power, he has been a life-long crony capitalist and has shown a willingness to work with them.  Meanwhile, Ted Cruz is an enormous threat to the existing power structure.  He has openly fought against the establishment and is likely to try to install his own supporters wherever he can.  In other words, Donald Trump is perfectly acceptable to the establishment faction.**The new Donald Trump faction:** They are a cult of personality.  Without Donald Trump they lack the top-down structure to be a political force in the Republican Party.  If Donald Trump wins the presidency then the Republican Party will truly never be the same as a Trump administration would create that structure to carry the nationalist populist faction forward.  If Donald Trump loses then they will most likely return to generally being apathetic and unrepresented.https://np.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/43436z/we_may_be_witnessing_the_collapse_of_the/czfgqwj?context=3 I don't know how many people know this, but Twitter just suspended the Houston Rockets account for using copyrighted music.I'm not an NBA fan or anything, but this is a pretty strong example of just how much power media companies have nowadays. They use copyright law as a cudgel against anyone who might use even portions of their property in a transformative way or otherwise in ways that should be covered under Fair Use. I'm sure there's an agreement between the main social media companies and legacy media companies in which social media platforms selectively enforce copyright rules to punish some accounts while allowing others to skate by. The most obvious example of this is the constant struggle that Stephen Crowder has had the last couple months between the Oscar livestream and the Dr. Trump parody. Both of use clearly fell under Fair Use but got shut down by YouTube for dubious copyright reasons.If I make a video consisting of the master recording of a song or a full movie that just got released in theaters, then obviously that's infringing on the trademark. That's depriving the distributors of the ability to capitalize on the property that they've made a significant monetary investment on. But considering that copyright law was written long before A) enormous media conglomerates owned the vast majority of intellectual property and B) the average American has the ability to take any piece of audio or video and effortlessly use it as part of their own media creation, it may be time to look at the current copyright laws we have and see if maybe we can modernize them.The main goals I'd like to see in a copyright reform would be to revert as many rights back to the original creators as possible, and limit the grounds upon which a copyright claim can be made.Here are the elements I'd want to push for:* **A "Creator's Final Approval" rule.** CFA would give the individual creator non-transferrable power to approve or disapprove of any use of the copyrighted material. This would bypass the media conglomerates and allow the original creator of the property to have final say on whether a particular use of their property is allowed. In the case of the "Dr. Trump" parody, for example, I would imagine that Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley would've been fine with it. This right to final approval would remain with the creator until they pass away, at which point the property becomes public domain. Perhaps the copyright can be willed to another individual by the creator's estate, but the point here is that Disney doesn't get to bludgeon someone into submission for something minor.* **An "Intent to Infringe" requirement.** Using 15 seconds of a song or a screencap from a movie is not the same as trying to pirate the song or movie. Copyright holders would have to demonstrate a clear intent to take their copyrighted property and represent it as their own. Note that monetization would not be part of this requirement: someone who posts a movie or a TV show on their YT channel for free would still be liable - even if they have that tried-and-true "I do not own this show" disclaimer in the description.* **A significant shortening of the durations of copyright protection.** Life plus 70 years is way too long. Or maybe it isn't, but it doesn't matter if the creator sells the rights to Viacom (who'll then own it forever). If the CFA rule is in place, then the length of protection would go Life plus 20 years. Your children will be able to monetize your property, but beyond that it becomes public domain.Obviously I know little about copyright law so I might be completely offbase here. But it just seems like we need to find a way to stop the media giants from absorbing every piece of media in the universe and then charging everyone through the nose for the privilege of experiencing it, with life-ruining consequences for stepping out of line that aren't even consistently enforced. Plus, it would have the added benefit of limiting the amount of money media companies would make off these acquisitions, perhaps limiting their influence on society in the process.What do y'all think? nan My son, age 5, was surprised to learn I paid for the pizza he was enjoying, and then asked ‚ÄúDaddy why do you pay for thing?‚ÄùI asked, ‚Äúdo you want the long answer or the short answer?‚ÄùAfter thinking for a minute, he said, ‚Äúlong‚Äù.I explained, ‚Äúa long time ago some people came to America thinking they could create a new society where people only had to work if they wanted and could take whatever they felt they needed from the community without giving anything back in return.‚ÄùEmphasizing the example I grabbed his water bottle and pretended to drink from it saying ‚ÄúI need this more than you‚ÄùUnderstanbly upset, he made a face and asked why I took it.‚ÄúWell it‚Äôs because under the society I just described these people tried to establish nothing you had belonged to you, it was all for the good of the community.  Everything including work wasn‚Äôt for your benefit but for the benefit of the community.  Anything you owned, grew, or made was expected to belong to no one.  In such a society I can just take your water because... well I think I need it more than you‚ÄùI continued with my story...‚ÄúThese settlers thought that people would work without being provided goods or services in return.... they were wrong.  No one wanted to work for nothing in return or for someone they didn‚Äôt know. So no one made food, or clothes, or offered services.  And very quickly, the settlers began to become very hungry.  In fact, they began to starve.  Then a wise man said, ‚Äòhe who does not work, will not eat!‚Äô That man was named John Smith and that is how capitalism came to stay in America.‚Äù‚ÄúToday, if I want food, I have to pay the person that makes that food because I didn‚Äôt make it, that person did!  It belongs to them and I need to trade them something they want for what I want.  This is why daddy and mommy work.  We provide a service and the people we work for give us money.  People like money because it can be traded for stuff like pizza or a water bottle‚Äù‚ÄúDaddy, can I have my water back?‚Äù‚ÄúSure, because if I kept it, or drank from it that would be stealing! Wouldn‚Äôt it?‚ÄùHe smiled and nodded.(For those wondering, I resisted the urge to ask him for something in return for the water bottle, this isn‚Äôt a lesson in civil asset forfeiture after all).So question for discussion:  How do you explain capitalism to your children?Think this could make a decent children‚Äôs book? nan nan We just suffered some huge losses these last few weeks and it is breath taking considering the GOP control congress.- Massive ominibus bill that funds everything Democrats wants and increases government spending by a massive margin. Democrats are openly bragging about a victory; as they should.- GOP giving into gun control non-sense; especially Trump. They allowed the left to control the narrative and then allowed them to control the solution. Trump pushing for a bump stock ban.Both fiscal and social conservatives got their asses handed to them; and for the most part it was not even close. Nearly half the GOP in the Senate voted for that shit ass budget. No one read it. This was exactly what we trashed Democrats for during the Obama years. The GOP claimed they would never do massive omnibus bills; and that every bill would be small and concise. Paul Ryan was even on record saying as much.----Where did we go wrong? How do Democrats get massive legislative victories while they are a minority? Is this due to lack of conservative narrative control? The left dominant the national narrative via social media and normal media to the point that they can dictate all policy going forward?Does the saying that the Republicans fear the media more than their own constituents explain this? Does that mean we conservatives need to be a lot more vocal and take some scalps via another tea party movement?Let us hope the GOP makes up for this massive screw up before midterms are we are looking at Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives. And they will be worse as we learned in the Obama years compared to the Bush years. But both seem to be bad. nan nan nan nan nan Introduction----This post is going to come off as a bit sexist; but that is not the intent. I am attempting to explore the modern political phenomenon known as being "triggered" and how the left came about to this position. Much of the speculation and exploration of this post is dealing in averages; or "stereotypes" of a gender. There are of course exceptions to the rule.----A bit of History----American culture or many cultures have sheltered women for thousands of years. We were told this was a part of the male patriarchy of suppressing women and their freedom. They were the "fairer" sex. Typically left out of discussions of war, politics, and business. The left stated that these were the areas of power thus the patriarchal men didn't want them involved in such matters. Even in countries like the United States that were founded on the concept of liberty and freedom women for the first 100+ years of the country were not given the right to vote. Even the racist Americans gave freed slaves the right to vote over 50 years before women were.The 20th century happened. Women's suffrage was gained, women's influence in higher education out stripped men, women's presence in the work force nearly rivaled men, women became the highest voting demographic. At the same time we see a rapid decline in married couples. We sense that this maybe due to a change in culture; and it definitely is. But maybe there are psychological reasons for this affect?----Psychological Differences----There have been many studies over the years comparing the minds of men and women. Some studies completely disregarded today starting with Freud. No matter the studies it is pretty apparent to most people that men and women have different ways of perceiving and thinking. Some might blame it on "hormones" but there appears to be a literal different in brain function and problem solving. A video I watched recently (can't find the link) a psychologist had a description that stood out. Men compartmentalize everything; he put it as "boxes". I have my yard work box, my mechanic box, my driving box, my job box, my husband box, etc. Given a situation men will choose which "boxes" they want to interact with and use. He even jokes that men's favorite box is the "nothing box"; as in if we can get away with it we would always use the nothing box. Which is just letting things go and relax; he uses the example of fishing.Women on the other hand have everything wrapped up into one big ball of string. Everything is connected. You start to pull on a string and you pull several other cross weaves along with it. This is often how men get in trouble with women as they feel they are talking about a particular subject; but don't realize that a woman is connecting it to a half dozen other subjects the man isn't even attempting to talk about (and isn't even able to perceive as those "boxes" were not utilized in the conversation).----Being Triggered----Being triggered is often suggested as being similar to PTSD by the left; in which conservatives laugh at the ridiculousness of it. But it could quite literally maybe the same phenomenon. An extreme emotional event that traumatizes the individual to the point that unrelated events can "trigger" flashes back to it.https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=18779This psychological phenomenon wasn't even observed or noticed until after Desert Storm in the 90's. It's something they may have been considered "common sense" in centuries past but had been lost in the cultural evolution of the 20th century. But you're saying "But come on ultimis, how can you compare someone who experiences an extremely violent event to the snow flakes being 'triggered'"? The reason being is the "snow flakes" are in fact women; but the left will never admit to this. You have mentally unstable men who will play into it; but the large and wide reason this exists is due to women. And this rolls back into historical perceptions and roles. We were told they were the evil patriarchy and that was the reason they suppressed women's "freedom"; but this seems to suggest that the concept of the "fairer" sex is in fact a reality even though the left refuses to admit to it.It is stated that women have a higher threshold for pain. I postulate men have a higher thresholds for psychological stress/discomfort. Pushing such thresholds have severe psychological effects such as PTSD. Men can and do hit that threshold as well; but women do so at a much lower level. Especially so due to how their minds work.----The Left Takes on the Role of "Sheltering" Women----The left has grown its intellectually bankrupt movement in the latter half of the 20th century from a large number of women. Why or how is not important to this discussion. One thing that they started to face quite rapidly was this different perception of the world and this threshold for psychological stress. Social conservatives lost the argument long before about protecting women from such stresses; so how does the left go about protecting this group?They have created a "sheltering" for women by popularizing "triggering" and creating "safe spaces". But they can't be honest about what they are doing; so they create the perception that it is for all people. Which is why conservative quickly saw it as "snow flakes" as we imagine men who couldn't handle stresses that we see as not that bad.This also creates the added benefit of shutting down conservative speakers/views while also keeping women from possibly accepting/identifying with those views.----So how much am I off my rocker here? Again this is a generalized discussion; there are exceptions to every rule. But if a certain population has a predominant outcome; we can't just ignore that.Do women have a lower psychological stress threshold than men? Or is it the spaghetti way of thinking that causes the issues? Or is the left literally full of delta male snow flakes who can't handle adversity on political subjects? Or is this movement literally a move to suppress freedom of speech of those they disagree with? nan nan How would you like the government to be funded? This is not a scope of government question; so the tax system should be viable for current and future spending. And on that note what are the pros and cons of each type of tax?- Sin taxes (alcohol, tobacco, etc)- Income Tax- Sales Tax/VAT Tax- Property Tax/Wealth Tax/Death Tax- Capital Gains Tax- Corporate Tax- Trade TaxesIs it good to have a diverse set of taxes? Or is one tax clearly better and all other taxes should be done away with? I grouped Property Tax with other taxes associated with total wealth as they seem to be targeting the same thing. I live in California where land value/property value is skyrocketing out of control; would a higher property tax fix that?Wealth taxes seem limited to property and death taxes. Wealth is innately taxed by inflation; would a direct tax on wealth be absolutely horrible? In theory a wealth tax would allow larger economic mobility and would end the trust fund kids/families that are not productive at all. At the same time we risk loss of investment and the innovation that comes along with that.----Of course there are a few ways to evaluate the "best tax". The obvious way is which generates the most revenue for the government with the smallest impact to the economy. Another one is to address "fairness"; what is the fair way to apply taxes (progressive tax?) Conservative being the former. edit: My title is a little strange. I meant to ask "Is Conservatism more than just delayed celebration of today's progressive principles?"Maybe my question is the wrong question to be asking, but I thought this was a bit of an important question in regards to the conservative "identity". Are we self-proclaimed conservatives nothing more than warriors fighting the never-ending attacks against sacred and traditional institutions? If so, wouldn't this mean that given enough time any new institution of today would become a traditional institution? A common attack on progressivism by Mark Levin is that progressive post-modernists seek to change the nature of humanity and its institutions scientifically. Therefore, societal values would always be in a state of change or "flux" for the sake of progress. If conservatism is in fact relative to a certain timeframe of a society, is conservatism safe from the progressives' social "flux" as long as they keep working towards changing our traditions?  First past the goal post voting only allows for two parties. Essentially united we stand, divided we fall. Example:District where 40% are Democrats and 60% are Republicans. Clear majority. Republicans fracture and become the Republican Party, The Tea Party, the Constitutionalist Party, and the Libertarian Party. Republicans get 30% of the vote, Tea Party gets 20% of the vote, Constitutionalist gets 8% of the vote, and the Libertarian Party gets 2% of the vote (because they can never get to 5% :P).Democrats win by a landslide. The political coalition that least represents your beliefs are now in power and are implementing policy that you are in direct opposition to because you couldn't stand to work within your coalition. ----What is a political coalition? It means you are working with differing political ideologies to form a ruling "party". Typically it means if you support my political priority; I'll support your political priority. We battle it out in the primaries with the knowledge that the winner is going to prioritize his/her issues over yours; but your issues will of course be under consideration as you are a member of the coalition.What happens when you vote in the primary but fail to vote in the general election? It's a betrayal of the coalition. As you are only interested in working within the coalition as long as things go your way 100% of the time. So other members of the coalition become resentful and trust your faction of the coalition a lot less. You've essentially burned some bridges and the coalition in general will move away from your priority issues especially if they can find replacement voters who are more consistent and have loyalty to the coalition (party).----How does a "principled" person work within a coalition? Can they? If they are rigid on such principles are they regulating themselves to a minority political group with no voice in the governing of the country? Is the attitude of "let it burn" a mature and productive position to have?Can you be principled and practical? John Adams believed in women's suffrage but refused to do anything about it during his time as he thought it was a lost cause and a waste of political capital and effort (as it would ultimately lose in his opinion). Was he unprincipled? Did he betray his convictions? Or was he realistic on what he was capable of accomplishing?How do we tell the difference between a "sell out" and a practical principled politician? What Cruz a sell out when he decided to back Trump in the general election against Hillary? What is the right balance between practical and principled? ----Voting reform is a possibility and it can be done at the state level (voter initiatives). This would allow multiple parties to be viable instead of the two parties. So each of those ideologies can branch out and have their own platform. But does that really change anything? Those ideologies will still need to form into a "coalition" in order to have a ruling government at the state and federal level. So called "independents" typically caucus with one of the major parties for a reason.Would you still prefer a priority voting system that way you can vote your consciousness without wasting your vote on a "3rd party"?----A couple of weeks ago I posted about values. I think that is very important to this discussion. Understanding your values, your priorities, and which values you would be willing to bend on to see a greater good (value) achieved.What do you think of the Two Party System? Are the two parties just the "same" corrupt entities but with different names? Is our representative Republic broken and no longer works for the people? Is the long game something you are willing to fight for? Or is immediate change the only option for you? From "Plan of Attack" by Bob Woodward, (a highly interesting look at the lead up to the Iraq War) a quote by President George W. Bush:> Let me make sure you understand what I just said about the role of the United States. I believe the United States is *the* beacon for freedom in the world. And I believe we have a responsibility to promote freedom that is as solemn as the responsibility is to protecting the American people, because the two go hand-in-hand... And I believe that. And I believe we have a duty to free people. I would hope we wouldn't have to do it militarily, but we have a duty.Do you agree with this? If not what is the United States' responsibility to the world? I know we have quite a few libertarian leaning conservatives on here who support a more isolationist stance from our military. Here is a video where Shapiro discusses some problems with it:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FkorxiPz3UIt's a few minutes in when he does the break down; but it hits to the heart of it for me.- Woodrow Wilson and the British pulled out of Operation Polar in 1917. This could have ensured the communists never took over Russia. Over a hundred million people alone have died from communism and its scourge upon the planet. The Nazis would have never risen up as they were a reactionary group to Communist Russia.- Nazi Germany started pushing its boundaries with aggression and both the United States and Britain didn't want to get involved. Journals from German generals make it clear that had there been a response from the powers that be; they would have turned on Hitler as they thought his plan was crazy. No response embolden them and further solidified Hitler's control over the military.- Chinese Civil War, the U.S. chose not to support the obvious side that was beneficial to us in the world. Meanwhile the Communist Russian state was arming the communists in China giving them a significant advantage. We also kept interfering with the faction that liked us with their ability to win the war. Mao would have never been a figure in China had the United States acted in our interest when it was necessary to do so.- Korea, the U.S. chose to give up the engagement (Truman) instead of crushing the Chinese military (General McArthur) and ending the communist problem in Asia.----To put simply this idea that we can avoid some losses and treasure spent costs us significantly more in the long run (in both treasure and lives). This idea that we can just avoid the problems set before us and they will go away is just not born out by history.To be fair a lot of people are more libertarian on foreign policy due to Iraq and Afghanistan which seem to be never ending conflicts. Iraq though was stable and ISIS would have never been a problem had Obama left a force in the Status Forces Agreement for stability purposes (again the rush to flee a problem, costs more lives and treasure later). In both cases they were a problem because the U.S. did not commit the resources necessary to win the engagement.What are your thoughts on military interventionism; and when do you think it necessary for the United States to engage?  nan Good Trump. Alarmists are melting down. What are your thoughts on this?

Unions no longer guarantee white working class votes.  * Identity Politics / Political Correctness - An oppressive ideology which has generated a great deal of resentment.* Loss of trust in the media - Only 32% of Americans overall and 14% of Republicans trust the media (Democrats 51%, Independents 30%).  * Email Scandal - The alleged corruption and FBI investigation of a major party candidate.* DNC leaks - Revelations that the DNC worked to help Hillary win the primary and that the primary debates were rigged.  #Trump Campaign* Data analytics.  In my opinion this is the primary reason Trump won and it has been largely ignored.  The New Yorker had an article the week before the election titled 'Why is Donald Trump in Michigan and Wisconsin?'.  In it they said; "The Trump campaign, though, is operating according to its own logic, or illogic." Trump's campaign released their predicted electoral map and the Washington Post called it "so bafflingly distant from reality that it‚Äôs hard to think this isn‚Äôt somehow an inside joke."  It had zero mistakes.  It wasn't an inside joke, it was superior inside information. Team Trump identified exactly which voters they needed to swing in each swing state.  They then built his entire campaign around those voters.  They identified the issues they needed to hit and the places they needed to visit.  Trump spent a lot of time in suburban and rural ares, bypassing the more obvious higher population areas.  Trump won the rural vote 3-1 with high turnout.  They claimed their internal numbers based on absentee voting and polling had them winning due to "hidden Trump voters" and their model being weighted with high rural turnout.  Everyone dismissed it as typical campaign spin, but that's exactly how the election went down.  * 'Make America Great Again'.  JFK used it.  Reagan used it.  A clear message that the campaign is about America, the American people, and restoring our greatness.  A unifying message with broad appeal that this campaign was about something larger than Donald Trump.* Radical Islamic Terrorism.  The Democrat position of terrorism has been hand-wringing that it makes Muslims look bad and it might cause some islamophobic Republican to say something bad about them.  This could not possibly be more out of touch with the average American.  It's a shocking disconnect that has Americans throwing votes at Republicans in the hopes that they'll take the problem seriously.  Trump hopped on this issue and rode it for all that it was worth.* Anti-Political Correctness.  The backlash against political correctness has been building for years.  Trump unabashedly and unapologetically said what he believed to be true, political correctness be damned.  He became the banner carrier for that backlash.* Nationalism vs. Globalism.  Trump pointed at China and Mexico and said they are to blame for your lot in life.  Then he said that the wealthy elite in America want it that way, appropriating the pre-existing narratives the Democrats have been pushing hard for years.  Then he promised to fix it through economic protectionism.   It's a compelling narrative that many people embraced.  #Hillary Campaign* Hubris.  The DNC / Hillary Campaign spent tens of millions trying to win the popular vote.  Trump won Louisiana by 20 points and Hillary won Illinois by 17.  Those states were never in play, yet there were huge Democrat media buys in Chicago and New Orleans late in the campaign.  Winning the electoral vote wasn't enough, Hillary wanted a mandate.  * 'I'm With Her'.  A campaign slogan purely about electing the first woman president.  This campaign wasn't about the voters.  It wasn't about America.  It wasn't about something bigger than Hillary.  It was about herself.  * Lack of a message.  What was Hillary for?  Does anyone know?  The best I could tell she was campaigning for the status quo, which is something almost nobody wanted.  Without a unifying message the Clinton campaign had to have a dozen different messages for a dozen different groups, some of them with conflicting interests.  That message was typically to tell them that they are victims and she would fight for them.  It's the default Democrat message and it worked pretty much as expected.  Hillary got almost as many voters as Obama's second election.  * Wisconsin and Michigan.  Hillary never set foot in Wisconsin, and didn't even send Obama there in her stead.  The SEIU wanted to reroute volunteers from Iowa to Michigan.  The Clinton campaign ordered them back to Iowa because they wanted Trump to dedicate more resources to Iowa and they hoped that if they seemed overly confident about Michigan that Trump wouldn't put resources there either.  They arrogantly believed that they were in control of the Trump campaign and could force him to respond to their tactics.  Trump didn't get the memo and took many trips to Michigan and even held his final rally there, the Hillary campaign never adjusted their strategy.* Hillary. Clinton fatigue, a haughty personality, a robotic cackle, a complete lack of accomplishments other than holding fancy titles, there are many reasons voters did not like Hillary as a person.  The biggest reason was the perception of corruption.  The DNC was practically an arm of her campaign during the Democrat primaries.  CNN leaked debate questions to the Hillary campaign through Donna Brazile, the vice chairperson at the DNC.  Hillary's email scandal, the Clinton Foundation pay-to-play corruption, the Democrat super-delegates all being for Hillary, election fraud during the Democrat primaries; with that much smoke people assumed there must be some fire. nan http://www.worldreligionnews.com/religion-news/arkansas-passes-bill-block-satanic-temple-statueAs resident C-Lounge religion pundit, I thought I'd offer an opinion on this.  I've had some people telling me that Arkansas' Capitol grounds should be "all or nothing" when it comes to the display of religious icons.  They tend to become a bit agitated when I disagree while still maintaining that such displays nevertheless do not violate the first amendment's establishment clause.My reasoning is first of all that there is nothing in the Constitution that says you can't erect a demon statue on state property‚Äîjust as it does not require that we banish crosses, the ten commandments, or nativity scenes on publicly-owned land.  But neither does it require elected policymakers to approve every request for such monuments.The so-called Satanic Temple is some combination of atheist trolls and (possibly) actual Satanists, as near as I can tell.  But their intent in this effort seems to be not the construction of their idol so much as it is an effort to shut down the display of religious-affiliated symbols on the Capitol grounds. The basis for their argument appears to be a misguided fairness doctrine based on the establishment clause of the 1^(st) amendment.I argue in response that policy makers are under no obligation to obsess over fairness in such cases.  Actual Satanism is connected to pedophilia and death-worship, and elected state officials are within their rights to consider that when determining what structures to approve.  This is probably a good opportunity to talk about original intent.  The framers of the Bill of Rights didn't conceive of a government that antagonized religion and kept all reference to God out of Washington.  Quite the contrary in fact, as Congress itself in 1777 was ordering thousands of Bibles imported and endorsing a Bible printed by Robert Aiken, [according to the Library of Congress.](http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel04.html#obj115)  But does this mean that all religions are entitled to equal levels of endorsement?  From a commonsense perspective, that kind of thinking just isn't very realistic or reasonable, particularly when you take parody groups like the [Satanic Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Satanic_Temple) into account.Building these statues and icons on Capitol grounds should be considered a privilege, not a right.  And this kind of privilege does not have to be extended to every group, as refusing to do so doesn't place any burden on the free exercise of religion.  I think elected officials would be within their rights to refuse to allow any religious symbols to be built at all, but they are under no obligation to either approve or reject any group.**tl;dr**  Free exercise of religion doesn't mean you're entitled to have your monument on the Capitol grounds of a state, nor does the establishment clause mean that equal permission to build monuments and statues in such places is required by the Constitution.  Arkansas lawmakers can approve or deny them as they see fit according to a traditional understanding of the 1^(st) amendment, especially when you take other amendments concerning state rights into account.Those are my casual, rambling thoughts on the matter at any rate. http://www.nationalreview.com/article/444439/neil-gorsuch-justice-scalias-supreme-successorAny complaints about this pick? Did Trump take an easy route? How badly will Democrats filibuster him?On a related note. How many justices do you think Trump will replace? Clarence Thomas is noted to not wanting to die on the bench meaning he will want to retire under Trump. Kennedy is also on the record saying he would like to retire under a GOP president (which would be nice considering his judicial history).So that would be 3 within the next 4 years if Trump doesn't look good going into 2020. If Trump looks good for 8 years Ginsburg will likely have to retire eventually. The court can finally be locked down on Rule of Law with leftists being forced to use the old fashion method of changing the law or the Constitution (by voting). nan nan nan Bigotry:>a person who is obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices; especially :  one who regards or treats the members of a group (as a racial or ethnic group) with hatred and intoleranceIntolerance:>lack of tolerance; unwillingness or refusal to tolerate or respect opinions or beliefs contrary to one's own.Sound like any particular group in America?http://reason.com/blog/2014/04/06/does-mozilla-dumping-its-ceo-over-prop-8Man donates privately to reaffirm the definition of marriage, he thinks it has a defined meaning and that it shouldn't be changed. Leftists leak his private donation and do a witch hunt to harass and persecute him. They *collude* and start a targeted boycott of the company until this man is fired. They cannot tolerate that he had a different view about marriage than they did, so he had to be destroyed (his personal livelihood). http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/19/showbiz/duck-dynasty-suspension/Another statement against Gay Marriage and a perception of homosexual behavior, though the network was overly eager to suspend him over the comment. But there was pressure that built up by leftists to fire him. In both of these examples the companies are free to do what they want, but there was a political collusion in their bigotry. So not only are they bigoted, but they are colluding to lash out at those they can't tolerate. This is KKK level activity.http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/20/pence-says-no-need-for-apology-after-hamilton-jeers-lecture.htmlAn incident where the actors took it upon themselves to call out the VP at a non-political function (where actors never call out the audience members) because their bigotry insisted that they do. Ignoring the fact that their comments were highly inappropriate strawmaning of the VP, the every act shows the bigotry. Essentially if you hold different views they hold this position: "no matter where you are we will harass you, we will destroy you."In cultural posts I have talked about their personalized tactics. And you can also witness if you debate politics on Facebook. Leftists will quickly personalize you as evil for holding your positions. It's not a matter of disagreement, it's because you're an evil person. This type of hatred and perception is why we see so much bigotry from the left. Because they are more willing to tolerate such bad behavior as long as it is targeted towards someone or a group that is more evil. Ends justify the means.Conservatives need to be willing to call out the leftist bigots. I watched a rant by Judge Jeanie on Fox News where she called them out for the bigoted action, but never put the label to it. Everyone knows that bigotry is wrong; yet the left is actively practicing it. The above two examples of collusion among bigots is why the Civil Rights bill was passed. Individual bigotry is wrong, but not necessarily breaking down civil order (as that individual and his/her choice is limited in scope). When the collusion occurs you see serious ramifications against the group that is targeted as well as a break down in our system. Don't be afraid to call them Bigots, and don't be afraid to make it clear that these were in the playbook for the KKK in how they harassed the groups they hated. It wasn't alright then, it isn't alright now. Trump released a list of 11 potential nominees in May, 2016.    * Steven Colloton, a judge on the Eigth Circuit Court of Appeals  * Allison Eid, a justice of the Colorado Supreme Court  * Raymond Gruender, a judge on the Eigth Circuit Court of Appeals  * Thomas Hardiman, a judge on the Third Circuite Court of Appeals  * Raymond Kethledge, a judge on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals  * Joan Larsen, a justice of the Michigan Supreme Court  * Thomas Lee, a justice of the Utah Supreme Court  * William Pryor, former Alabama attorney general  * David Stras a justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court  * Diane Sykes a judge on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals    * Don Willett, a justice of the Texas Supreme CourtTrump then added 8 additional potential nominees in September, 2016.    * Mike Lee, Senator(R) of Utah  * Neil Gorsuch, a judge of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals  * Margaret Ryan, a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces  * Edward Mansfield, a justice of the Iowa Supreme Court  * Keith Blackwell, a justice of the Georgia Supreme Court  * Charles Canady, a justice of the Florida Supreme Court  * Timothy Tymkovich, chief judge of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals  * Amul Thapar, a judge of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky  * Frederico Moreno, a judge of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida  * Robert Young, chief justice of the Michigan Supreme Court  Here are a few articles about the nominees:* [Separate Heritage Foundation List with six names that overlap with Trump's lists (Pryor, Sykes, Colloton, Gruender, Willett, & Lee)](http://dailysignal.com/2016/03/30/the-next-supreme-court-justice/)* [Washington Post review of the initial list](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/05/18/who-are-the-11-people-on-donald-trumps-short-list-for-the-supreme-court/)* [Heritage Foundation review of the initial list](http://dailysignal.com/2016/09/23/a-conservative-take-on-trumps-new-supreme-court-nominee-list/)* [Powerline review of the second list](http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/09/trump-puts-out-new-list-of-potential-supreme-court-nominees.php) http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/435078/republicans-didnt-cave-obamaPretty typical Trump arguments are that the GOP caved on everything, so we should acquiesce to the guy who doesn't have convictions about anything.  I thought the above article does a decent job explaining what we DIDN'T give up to an Obama presidency, and it's quite a lot. nan Is Nancy Pelosi obstructing justice by not delivering the articles of impeachment to the senate? We saw the socialists attempt to achieve their agenda by multiple tactics throughout the 20th century. Everything from violent revolutions to "peaceful" democratic tyranny.By the end of the 20th century it was clear socialism could not compete in both economic effectiveness and popularity. Their take over of higher education was ineffective as the failure of their ideology was clear to all. Russia had abandoned it as had China. Rogue ineffectual states were the only ones stubbornly continuing to use it.We saw an odd shift from left leaning groups in the 80's and 90's world wide. They pushed for unfettered immigration. This should have made conservatives wary as Democrats for instance were staunchly against immigrantion for a long time for obvious reasons; protecting the "working class".Fast forward a couple of decades where conservatives accepted this odd change in behavior. This was a new "globalist" movement. As far as fiscal conservatives were concerned this was good news. Europe has wide spread started abandoning capitalism and civil liberties. California has transformed from an all American state, purple, to a leftist hell hole. And conservatives are left scratching are heads on how such a completely failed ideology could be on the rise again. How could a population that understood socialism was shit suddenly be actively supporting a loser like Bernie Sanders.Would it surprise you to know 1/4th of the entire population of California (roughly 10 million people) were not born in the United States? That does not include illegal immigration. A good number more are second generation immigrants. In a state where "multiculturalism" was so successfully pushed.Socialists have determined that they aren't going to convince the west to embrace their horrible moral framework. Their infiltration and manipulation of academia and media wasn't enough as reality constantly contradicted them. What they have done is decided to replace populations enough that their control of those institutions will have an actual effect to over come western values. We just saw Ireland legalize abortions and threaten to defund Catholic hospitals. Ireland. EU moved significant immigrants into the country to the point that such a hardcore catholic country would betray such a core tenet of their value system.----Is there an active conspiracy by the left to replace traditional populations to achieve their agenda? Is this the reason Identity Politics is being pushed full force by the left? Are the capitalists supporting unrestricted immigrantion unwittingly ensuring their own demise?I have covered immigration and birth rates in previous posts. American and European birth rates are a serious problem. https://nypost.com/2017/10/21/the-other-half-of-america-that-the-liberal-media-doesnt-cover/Former head of NPR who did a year long sabbatical integrating into Republican culture and populations.Effectively admits the media is suffering from group think and has abandoned all pretense of neutrality. He softens the blow by claiming Republican demagogues and the president are also at fault. Because how dare they criticize a media that is beyond biased and is acting as a propaganda arm to the Democratic Party? nan nan Is it possible to legislate this phenomena away? Clearly it's free speech; but there does seem to be some criminal negligence in the activity.1. Intentionally sitting on a witness accounts for up to a year that could collaborate an accusation of illegal activities so maximize political damage to opposing party.2. Causing undue burden on public institutions and undermining the electoral process by intentionally holding off on information in order to sabotage the democratic process. Millions of dollars gone into an election and candidates to find the best leaders for our country; and media outlets/organizations having knowledge/information that could have stopped a candidate from getting to the last hurdle but choosing to sit on it until it is too late to adjust candidates.Clearly the October Surprise is morally reprehensible. Politically it is smart. Let your opposition put up someone you have dirt on; wait until your opposition has no ability to switch candidates; then dump your information. And to a certain degree opposition research this seems okay. But when you have 'victims' coming out only when it's convenient politically or news organizations sitting on video for nearly two years it begs to question what moral lines we are willing to cross for winning elections.----Is there any legal way to discourage this? Fines? Criminal neglect (allowing a sexual predator to run loose for long periods of time due to political gains)? Or should this even be addressed? Short Firewall video by Bill Whittle:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9DLGTYd5wE&t=5s"Well I think that denying the killer publicity is impossible in the age of the internet. I'm more a fan of ruthlessly ridiculing the perpetrator. Dig up all the embarrassing dirt. Don't mystify them, turn them into clowns.Ôªø"The media thrives for mass shootings and tragedies as it brings them ratings. The above quote is from a YouTube comment. You think this maybe a means of reducing these fame seekers? I have personally shunned all news on mass shootings. If there is an ideological reason; than yes the investigators and the public need to crack down on that. But suicide infamy is tempting for those who have decided to hate life and all those living. Would attacking their supposed "legacy" by making them clowns be effective? And would this in some way be harmful to the victim's families? nan We have touched up on critical thinking a few times on this board. But one thing I have noticed in life and in politics is a severe lack of self reflection by people. As in they define themselves by their externalities but don't really have a grasp about self identity. This falls into understanding ones own values and thinking through where each intersects and where they conflict. If we had a population that had better self reflection would our political climate be in a better situation?Is self reflection at odds with impulse based decision making? Would it make decisions less emotional? Would we as a society like this pushed more in schools? English theoretically is the perfect spot for people to find their "self voice"; but is it doing a good enough job to grow this? And not only grow the self voice; but also encourage self reflection for why they have that voice?Would a society that looks inward before looking outward be more selfish? Short post today. Just a snippet from the Ben Shapiro Show:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LShDealN770"Trump is only good at one thing. Trump is good at starting culture wars and winning culture wars. He's actually quite good at this." ~Ben ShapiroDo you think this is true? This is a follow up of the earlier thread I posted on this. Interesting to see Ben admit to this.

Particularly with regard to the skilled/unskilled labor piece, it seems to me that taking in immigrants based on their intended occupation is a dangerous market manipulation, not unlike regulations that try to tweak the otherwise free market and end up with unintended consequences. Making an effort to bring in skilled labor seems like it would artificially increase supply and depress wages for these skilled labor jobs. People looking to immigrate will learn a trade to earn enough 'points' to get in. Not allowing unskilled labor in seems like it will decrease the supply of unskilled labor and drive up the cost, making it a perfect storm for disincentivizing job training and picking up skilled trades among natural born citizens. I'm sure that's not the intention. If the aim is to increase the number of people learning skilled trades, I'd rather see a temporary tax credit be put into place.All in all, it seems to me that the proposed immigration plan is unnecessary manipulation of the labor markets. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-Qg_4zqpDINew Prager University video. Would Kennedy be considered a Republican based on his policies? Would he be a conservative?-Money in the Hands of the people (lower taxes)-Strong military to keep the peace-Gun rights/Minute man/Citizen soldiers-Opposed the use of abortion for population control (birth control, the primary reason abortions occur today 90-95% of all abortions)-Color blind government policies.If Kennedy would be considered a conservative today. Was he a conservative of that time? Or were conservatives of that time focused on preserving the Status Quo; instead of a return to the founding principles of the country?Finally are we seeing people who remained in the Democratic party for years finally migrating over to Republicans because they realize that the party no longer has any connection to what JFK stood for? So called JFK Democrats. And was Trump successful at getting any of them to cross over? I was answering a question for another redditor about why the highest educated demographics (postgrad) tend to be liberal and vote democratic, and I wanted to point out the least educated demographic (no HS diploma or GED) typically votes Democratic by a roughly 2:1 margin. So quickly searching for some 2016 voting demographic polling, here's what I noticed:Most sources I found aggregated high school education or less in reporting 2016 voting demographics.I thought this was kind of odd because if you look at 2014, 2012, 2010, 2008 voting demographics, they do provide a distinction between HS diploma/GED vs no HS diploma/GED. I know 2016 was unique because Trump did better among high school educated voters, whereas that's a demographic Democrats typically win. Do you think there is a polling bias to present Republicans as the less educated party after Trump's victory? Thoughts? When violence is perpetuated; people write it off as crazy. How legitimate do you think this is? Especially considering all of human history and the amount of violence perpetuated by humans onto other humans. The hand wave of "Crazy" is applied a lot. Where do we draw the line of Crazy and Evil? And does this habit of dismissing these actors as Crazy mean that there is no real moral responsibility for people who commit evil actions? nan I have recently done some research relating to the demographics of the united states of America in the coming years. What I saw was interesting, buy surprise began to turn to dread. It is estimated by the PEW Research Center that the US demographics with be as follows by 2060: 43% White, 32% Hispanic, 13% Black, 8% Asian, and 5% Other. What scares me is the increase in Hispanics and for not the usual reasons, I am not concerned about Hispanic culture or crime rates. What concerns me as of now is the voting habits of Hispanics. While the voting habits may not be the same in ~50 years the risk is that they very well could be.As we know, Hispanics have voted massively in favor of Democrats for a while now. This is bad due to the rhetoric and policies of the left these past few years. It has been made apparent that Democrats are against most of the values that America, to a point of tyranny. If both of these trends continue, it could mean a lot of crazy shit after Trump and his succesors have spent there time in power.Considering these trends, there must be a way to prevent a few of them. The Hispanic demographic growth is inevitable, but how can we turn this, at the very least, into something that is no longer a negative. If I could control this, my plan would be simple to spread, but difficult to enact. We need to defeat the left's current form, and do so as fast and as completely as possible. Then we must find a way to build bridges with the Hispanic community, as it is vital to America.While this demographic change with have its full effect in the later years of our lives, it will directly effect the lives of our children, and for some of us, our grand-children.So, what are your thoughts? To racist? To dim? Not based in Facts? nan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxOo2f2BxocThis short clip by Andrew Klavan brings up the paradigm of the left that they don't believe in objective truth. We have had discussions related to this; but there seems to be a contradiction.1. The left doesn't believe in objective truth and will manipulate language and facts in a false presentation in order to create a new "truth" that fits their narrative.2. The left likes to be the arbiters of "Truth" or "Facts". Which is why they commonly pretend as if they speak for "Science" on issues (authority of facts), they dominate academic institutions so they can teach their "facts", and they control the media/journalism so they can tell the public the "facts".So does the left not believe in objective facts? And if that is so, why do they always attempt to argue from authority about facts? Is this just a matter of their fascist nature of state centric truth/value system where they believe as long as they are an authority they can dictate what facts are and we are supposed to just accept them? Words now have new meaning because they stacked the courts and judicial activists declared them to now mean what the left wants them to mean? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uX_qbkuOzRAClip from the Ben Shapiro Show. The opening segment has list from a leftist on why "originalists" are bad on the court. It gives you an idea of how they see the court as an instrument in implementing their "social justice" and political agenda.Some issues brought up in this video regarding Gorsuch:- stare decisis or precedent seems to be something Gorsuch has made clear is the law. While we understand this; is it concerning that he emphasizes it so much? Is it possible he may refuse to overturn Roe v. Wade due to this?- Is Ben right that we really need to know if they think a previous ruling is bad or not? And does such knowledge mean that the judge will be immediately filibustered?- Does the Garland block have legs? Gorsuch seems untouchable; will they block it on the retarded principle that Chris Mathews makes that it was "Obama's appointment and Republicans robbed him of it"? I don't think that will be winning any elections.----This is going to get nasty if Beyer or Ginsburg retire under Trump. But the court needs to be righted and the corruption needs to end. I've been watching the Gorsuch confirmation hearings this week. Chuck Schumer just spoke on the floor of the senate and said he would not vote for Gorsuch, and Gorsuch would need cloture to be confirmed by the senate. He then laid out his reasoning against McConnell for blocking Garland, Trump for criticizing the judiciary, and Gorsuch for how he thought he was unfit and would rubber stamp a conservative and Trump agenda. He also said that nominee needs to be changed, not the senate rules.Should Republicans consider the nuclear option if they cannot reach cloture?Edit: I watched it on CSPAN, so I was paraphrasing, but here's links to a few articles:https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/gorsuch-confirmation-hearing-to-focus-today-on-testimony-from-friends-foes/2017/03/23/14d21116-0fc7-11e7-9d5a-a83e627dc120_story.html?utm_term=.c7998029b4d5http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/schumer-democrats-filibuster-trump-scotus-nominee-gorsuch/story?id=46328386https://www.wsj.com/articles/schumer-calls-on-democrats-to-block-gorsuch-confirmation-1490284872 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lALvmZXQVbQAbout 8-9 minutes in Shapiro covers the following:Trump Scandal Progress (Propagated by the media):1. Trump tweets something, it is not accurate, but it has a connection to reality (typical Trump hyperbole).2. The left in response takes the opposite approach and screams: "That's false, it has no connection to reality!" (apparently copying Trump's hyperbole is appropriate).3. Then the right responds with: "Well it does have some connection to reality..."4. Then the left says: "You're all liars! It's fake news!"5. Then the right says: "It's not fake news, because there are facts that show you're wrong" (which doesn't support Trump's hyperbole, but shows the left is wrong).As we consevatives learned in the primaries; Trump is very effective at dragging you down with him when you engage in his hyperbole. The media's job approval rating is at it's lowest levels ever recorded, yet they can't help themselves. It's like a moth attracted to the flame. Trump likes to say/tweet whatever is on his mind at the time. We have long figured out that there is no PR or writing staff on hand to review the tweets (as often his grammar is horrible)... Is this really genius on Trump's part as Trump Conservatives claim; or are we witnessing a marvelous social experiment that is making the left/media implode? Foreign policy is mostly ignored on this board so far. As we learned in the 20th century conflicts can go out of control and can have far reaching consequences for the United States whether or not we want to be involved.What do you think or who do you think will be a threat to the American stability for the last 70 years? Terrorism seems more like some hiccups in between some major conflicts. Leftists have been claiming scarcity will be the major driver of war by the year 2000. This still seems plausible, what scarcity will drive the world to war?We keep seeing socialism rearing its ugly head. Are we destined to continue to fight this battle for centuries on end even though it is proven a terrible idea; over and over again?I know we have a lot of libertarians on here as well. What is the correct balance of projecting power to the world to shape events in our favor? A balance between projecting power and isolationism. The Ron Paul's of the world would like us to hide behind our borders and wait until nukes are being dropped on us before acting; where do you see the proper amount of action by the United States? I think we are all fatigued from Nation Building from the Bush years.I know my post is all over the place. But try and keep the discussion to international/foreign policy. nan nan What does the free market mean to you? What regulation do you find to be necessary? Does the government have a role in breaking up Monopolies? Are monopolies are problem? Should market action ever be used for political action?Sorry for not stirring up more conversation. I'm helping to moderate a large subreddit and have limited time for reddit in general. nan nan I know this isn't /r/ConservativeMeta, but I'm more concerned about my understanding of the ideology than I am here to rant, and I trust this sub more than any other to be the last bastion of purity of ideology.I just got banned from /r/conservatives for a heated argument wherein I insisted that the first amendment protects your right to speak freely, even if that speech will make someone feel uncomfortable, triggered, threatened, unsafe, etc.I believe that if we allow limiting speech based on someone else's subjective experience, it's all fair game for legislating "hate speech" and other subjective measurements, the definitions of which are, again, subjective, and therefore vague enough to start defining things like political dissent as "illegal speech". Furthermore, if we allow exceptions to constitutional rights, then it completely justifies things like the left's demands for strict gun control. Ultimately, it turns the constitution into a suggestion.The mods of that sub, and many others seemed to share a consensus that stating intent to harm someone (even more so if you include a specific time and place apparently) infringes on other, non-enumerated, unnamed rights, and therefore the first amendment somehow no longer applies.I deeply believed that my ideal was not only shared by other conservatives, but that it was a core foundational principle of conservatism that we all took for granted.Am I wrong? Do conservatives typically see my belief as extreme borderline anarchy, as the people in that sub did?If I am wrong, maybe someone can explain it on a deeper level, because while I understand that threatening speech is bad, I don't see how outlawing it can remain morally and logically consistent with many of our other beliefs and criticisms of the left. I have a lot of my own reasons as to why I consider myself a conservative and not a libertarian, mainly dealing with the fact that I think a little government is good. A lot of my libertarian friends all advocate with the idea of Anachro-capitalism, or AnCap, I also think that they are a little bit to focused on marijuana legalization and not actually important stuff like defending the Constitution.I'm curious to hear your reasoning why you're a conservative and not Libertarian nan nan nan nan nan This is from a speech at University of Minnesota, Morris in his latest tour across college campuses (some of which barred him from showing up). This is a bit different than his previous speeches, but he covers all the relevant topics for college students.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ut7bXED9xQHere are some things I picked out from this speech:- The left does not pursue policy that is good/effective; they pursue policy that makes them feel good. He uses examples of Obama dismissing actual statistics and claiming that police need to change their ways not because they actually are racist, but that because people *feel* that they are racist. He uses the SCOTUS decision as another example. They did it because they felt the need to "give" dignity to same sex couples, not that it was necessary or good policy. It doesn't matter that dignity is earned and not given, they want to use the government and policy to make themselves feel good about these activities.- The left pursues thought crimes. They completely dismiss facts as feelings are the only thing that matters to them in terms of political discourse. And if you challenge their feeling with facts, you are a threat. I'll add on to this: The left can't tolerate competition as they know their ideas will fail. This type of activity from the left is bigoted and no one seems to want to call them out on this.----Q&A (Starts around 33 minutes in roughly)- Reading he recommends to conservatives who are looking at a good primer. He says his 200+ podcasts have a recommended book at the end of each.1. Constitution, federalist and anti-federalist papers.2. Economics in one lesson by Henry Hazlitt.- Shapiro does not think we need more than two parties, we just need non-crappy candidates (unlikely based on how our media works). He states the Libertarian party had a shining opportunity to be an emerging third party and they failed horribly by nominating Gary Johnson.- He is asked about Gitmo and holding people without trial. He makes it clear that such constitutional rights are afforded to American Citizens, not enemy combatants. That that they have been tried under military tribunals. The Geneva Convention is not applicable due to the nature of what the Geneva convention was; they wanted all combat soldiers to be in Uniform fighting away from civilian areas. Terrorists specifically do not wear uniforms and fight in civilian areas which violates the whole purpose of the Geneva Convention. So no they are not protected under the Geneva Convention and they are also not afforded rights under the Constitution.- Talks about Thomas Sowell's cultural case of "Red Neck Culture" being the predominate black culture in urban cities. This is an important distinction, as the left will attempt to declare that any culture is equally valuable (as they believe in diversity of values); and any attempt to call a culture less than optimal is just racist. The red neck culture (which originates from a part of Scotland) tends to be more violent, and the violence difference between the North and South does give credence to this theory. He further states that part of this problem is an under policing of black neighborhoods. We have seen this in recent times as race riots and the left has demonized the police, the police have stepped back their policing of black neighborhoods and violence/crime has increased. He brings up the lack of fathers in the home as a major contributor as well.- The large number of Bernie millennials is concerning for Ben, but they should become more conservative as they get older. But the fact that the country is so far "left" might mean they will be less conservative than previous generations. Conservatives will need to be actively reaching out to all demographics over the next 4 years to ensure a massive back swing doesn't take us out. He also believes that Trump needs to be a different persona when he is president or it could hurt us bad with the younger population.- He is asked why does the left use labels like "racist, homophobe, bigot" on the right when they don't agree. It's because they don't want to have a discussion. And that leads into the point I made above in the main speech section: the left cannot tolerate competition to their ideas. This is why federalism is completely ignored by them and why they pursue judicial activism and federal mandates for their positions. Why on climate change they opened the political discourse with "The Science is settled and we are right", which couldn't be further from the truth. Though they did it to shut down opposition to their political position.- He covers Obamacare, single payer option, and what should be done. He compares areas like Laser Eye surgery and how they are not involved in insurance and medical and how the prices have gone down and the services are top notch. He wants Health Insurance to exist for only catastrophic purposes only, so that pre-existing conditions are completely void. Reduce regulations and open up the markets, increase the supply (giving Nurse Practioners the power to do more). A freer market is the only correct solution for a good healthcare system.- "Love conquers all". It is much easier to argue from an emotional standpoint than and logical and rational stand point. Shapiro makes the case that you have to start with the emotional/moral arguments first and foremost to lead them out of it. I have personally believed that any person who has come to a conclusion via emotions can only be unconvinced of that conclusion by emotions. The same with logic, a person convinced of a position by logic will not be deterred by an emotional argument. I would also throw out a quote from Mark Twain "It is easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled". A logical person will attempt to convince the emotionally convinced person that they have been fooled by logic. It won't happen. So the Gay Marriage argument of "how dare you strip away their rights as any two people who love each have the right to marriage". You respond with "how dare you deny children the right of having a mother and father; as marriage has always been about procreation and you are ensuring children are denied that fundamental right". You may feel dishonest used the moral/emotional argument but it's tailoring the logic in the frame of a emotional argument (which is hard for conservatives to do).----Not more to say on this. Feel free to pick some of the topics covered and expound upon them. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umyy2VhHByUThis is redundant as I did a post similar to this before. This is a different venue in which he talked about it; I'll try and keep the list short and concise. He takes questions at 42:10 if you want to hear his Q&A section which is less redundant.1. Frame your opponent. Let their positions and biases be a declared and known factor. Do not let them pretend to be unbias.2. Frame the debate. Framing the debate is important as a poorly framed debate will have you going off on massive tangents and emotional roller coasters.3. Show their philosophical inconsistencies. This may seem like a slippery slope, but it is important to show the logical conclusion of their arguments. The leftists will never tell you what they truly believe as often the logical conclusion is repugnant to the general population.4. Don't get side tracked by their attempts to side track. Call them out on going off on a tangent, and drag them back to the debate (framing the debate will help this immensely).5. Don't be intimidated. The left will attempt to make it personal and make you hate the discussion. Be willing to walk towards the fire and don't take their attacks personally. Ad hominem is a common tool.6. If you don't know something, admit it. Table it for another time until you have had time to research that specialized knowledge. They will intentionally pull up specialized knowledge in order to trip you up and then try and claim your entire argument is flawed because they caught you making a mistake in this random knowledge that they have mastered.7. Let the other side have worthless victories. It makes you seem moderate and reasonable when you admit "You're right on that". So if you make a semantic mistake, correct yourself and let them know that they were right. They may feel like they won something, but from an outside perspective they gained nothing from it.8. Don't feel the need to defend other people that associate with your politics. You're an individual, if they did something wrong (or not) it is not up to you to defend them. This can often be used to side track the main discussion as you will feel the need to clarify how their comparison is wrong (which will nearly always be so).9. Reverse the polarity. Don't buy into the positions that they are taking. This is similar to 1 and 2. Make it clear that they are not really objective and that they have a motive/bias in the discussion.10. Body language/presentation is very important. For reddit body language doesn't exist, but the presentation of your arguments does. If you use poor formatting, poor grammar, poor sentence structure you will greatly hurt your cause and ability to influence people.----Q&A1.) Ben makes it clear he has no problem with a network like MSNBC. As they are honest in their bias. Who he's unhappy with is people like George Stephanopoulos who pretends to be objective while literally he sat on the Clinton campaign coming up with political strategy. Or CNN which acts as if it's a moderate network, where it has insanely biased reporting. I would throw in individuals like Jon Stewart who pretend as if they are moderate and it just so happens they target conservatives more because they are just "more deserving" of ridicule than the left.I first notice in my political life this to occur in the documentary "Bowling for Columbine". Today we know that Michael Moore is a far left extremist, but when he launched that documentary he pretended as if he was out "to find the truth". It's this false objectivity which is really offensive. We shouldn't find people who have differing views offensive, it's people who dishonestly represent their positions and dishonestly represent their oppositions positions we should find offensive.2.) Social issues should they be turned over to the state's in terms of federalist principles? Shapiro argues that Gay Marriage is a lost argument because we allowed leftists to uproot marriage 40 years ago, and this was just a symptom of that cultural failing. Now that we're at this junction it is best to try and remove government out of marriage completely. Abortion is an easier issue as it just requires us to educate people, where marriage requires us to roll back the common perception of marriage "two people who love each other".3.) How do we deal with the moderation bias that comes from the media? Don't put up with it. George should have never been allowed to moderate a GOP debate, where he can literally ask questions for Obama (WikiLeaks shows us the media will literally request input on questions from the DNC and Democratic Party Leadership).He states that Romney should have called out Candy Crowley for being a biased liberal and then go onto explain what he meant. Don't allow them to get away with bs biased questions, which is something that Trump occasionally got right.4.) Those who use Islamaphobe are those who want to be soft on terrorism. It's to diffuse any action on terrorism. Like when people call you a racist for supporting Voter Id.5.) Being civil gives you a tactic victory. Obama didn't come out and call Romney a racist or evil, his surrogates did. But he constantly implied it via his campaign messaging (and Joe Biden saying "Put you back in chains"). Be willing to call out leftists when they imply something about your positions. The recent Hamilton lecture of Pence showed this in a very obvious way. There were *huge* glaring implications about Pence being made that need to be called out immediately for vile and that they should apologize for. Trump was wrong to be tweeting like a crazy, but conservatives at large should have been doing that on his behalf. If they imply racism or evil; call them out.You can be "civil" while also calling them out and debunking what they are saying. Tear down their facade of civility and show their true colors to the nation. The Premise----After watching the video on BLUE (/u/DEYoungRepublicans linked to me in our climate chage discussion) and seeing a paradigm difference that really needs to be addressed: what role should the government truly provide? What does government exist to do? Really. The first governments going back in time were the predominate land owners and those that provided protection to the people who lived on their lands. Defense. They also exist to handle disputes between different parties via the courts or through standardized laws. Justice. Often these governments have also been used to "promote a public good" or as the framers stated "general welfare". Common interests.Our federal government was formed with those three principles in mind. But such principles exist in all layers of our government with more power being maintained in a federalist system. Where each more localized government (State, County, City) acts as an arbiter to those entities that resides under them while also defending the interests of those under them against other entities.But one of these three principles is actually more fundamental and is the very fabric of our Constitutional Republic; a governing body exists to handle disputes between represented parties. This is more than just two individuals fighting it out in a court room, this could be two different towns, two different states, two different parties. But more fundamentally these disputes happen closer to the people being governed. The dispute over property will be arbitered by a local court and generally governed by local laws that make sense for that given community. Conflict resolution. I recall a saying on a TV. show (forgot which one) that our system is a very bloody affair (metaphorically). There are wars and there are victors. All done without a shot fired, but wars none the less. Our system allows a conflict resolution among parties that makes real war unnecessary. Our political system is so nasty, but it is preferable to the alternative.----The Conflict----What is the paradigm difference I danced around above? To put simply, *federalism*, but it's more than that. It's a concept that individuals fighting for their own interests are best to determine what happens within their communities. Our movement, the right, or conservatives see that the most power over our lives should be determined closer to the people. While the left, or some on the left, want to see the power centralized further and further from the people that they govern.It's a locality vs. global. The individual vs. the collective. Though libertarians get it wrong in this debate as again there is still a function for the government, and they seem to support an extremist form of liberty that undermines that purpose. There is an in-between the two groups of individual and collective, and that is the "community". This concept of community is often lost in urban/city environments which is possibly why people living in cities are more leftist. We are not just individuals, we are individuals living within a community, that community forms up with other communities into counties (in most states) those counties form up into a state, and the states form up into the United States. There is a relationship that exists between each of these entities, and "rights" that exist at every level *except* federal.What is the leftist (progressive) paradigm? We have perceived it as always more and more federal power. All the way back to the 19th century when you first saw progressives popping up their goal was always an enlargement of the federal government. Though the number of people working for the federal government is less of the issue, it's the sheer power of the federal government in how it can dictate to the States, Counties, Communities of this country with implicit authority on issues they are completely oblivious about.But it goes beyond just empowering the federal government, as we saw with Hillary's comments on globalism from wikileaks they literally want to empower an even further removed authority to override the will of the people. We see things like the Agenda 21, the United Nations, the failure of the European Union. This structure is the complete reverse of federalism, and it's the paradigm the left has been set on. This path for the left has existed long before the Frankfurt school. It's a model of elite thinkers dictating how the people should live their lives. Socialism claims it will cast away all government once it's Utopia has been achieved, but that's in the reality that the people are doing exactly what these elites are telling them what to do. They want all the power centralized and far removed from the people that it governs. The further removed from the people the less the people can fight the tyranny that these individuals are about to unleash on them. The leftists don't only oppose competition within economic principles, but political and social principles as well. While we see competition between communities and between states as a good thing, they don't. They don't even like competition among individuals. Our very conflict resolution process distresses them as they can't just impose their will on us. California has laws that recognize Marriage and give some benefits/privileges to those who partake in the behavior. The courts dictate California is not allowed to decide which behaviors are good and bad and forces the state in 2005 to ensure all those same benefits and privileges are given to Domestic Partnerships. Then the court strikes again a few years later and says that the State can't just recognize Marriage as the historically known definition: a union between a man and a woman; they must accept a new definition pushed by the left (who can't democratically do this, they must use the least democratic process possible). And then Proposition 8 occurs in 2008 in order to reaffirm the definition of marriage; and the left are outraged by this action.So if the left doesn't like competition, it only makes sense that they don't want a diversified power structure (as they hate diversity of thought). So the easiest push for them was the federal government, but it clearly doesn't end there. They want a top down power structure that exists in a global body far removed from the interests of the people it governs. Shit heads like Bernie Sanders are attempting to cover up their tyrannical approach to government by throwing "Democratic" in front of it. As in, "How could it be bad if we democratically vote for our tyranny"?----The Role of Government----So does that mean that conservatives in nature should oppose a world governing body? No. Well yes, if we believe it is impossible to stop such far removed authority from usurping power from the localized authorities. The founders were faced with such a similar conflict. The federal government was necessary for the three reasons I listed in the premise: Defense, arbitration, common interests. But at the same time corruption nearly always occurs. The anti-federalists failed in their bill of rights of ensuring the federal government remained restrained. The federalists failed in their vision of an explicitly defined government. They under estimated this movement that formed on the left and its willingness to pervert the rule of law to achieve their agenda. Rule of Law was so utterly important to them that it was hard for them to imagine a society where such a large portion of the population would throw it away so carelessly.I'll go from the stand point of "No", in that we believe such evil can be contained (this is debatable and I encourage anyone reading this to argue for or against this). A world government does not necessarily need to exist as the left envisions it. I will work my way through the Role of Government *from the bottom up* as our paradigm demands.We start with the individual, with inalienable rights endowed upon us by a creator (if you believe in that). The individuals find themselves within a family, and that family formulates it's rules and does the best to deal with said rules. Individuals also exist within a community of people (unless you're a hermit out in the middle of nowhere). The community of people decided upon rules that govern their interactions; they arbitrate disputes between individuals (fighting, property, decency, environment); they come up with a means to protect the individuals in the community from harm; and they work on projects that benefit the community that is a common interest (education, roads, infrastructure, etc).As we all know even the community level government can be corrupt (and often is in some form), but it is easier for the people to mobilize to correct such problems. County level governments are less important, but does represent a broadening of scope. The common interests of the county are more generalized, though we do see that education is still a common interest but the way of going about it may not be agreeable (though most likely it is at this level of government).Next we have the State governments. We have states like California that oversee 38 Million people with vast ranges of culture, geography, and economic interests to states like Wyoming with 900,000 people in the entire state. We are seeing the first form of government that is fairly far removed from the communities and definitely far removed from the individual. Again this government *should* finds itself in the position of arbitrating between community conflicts (less so with individuals). It is also a defining attribute for people living with the state, usually a shared culture (though California fails on this front). Our Constitution leaves all the power to the States (except for powers reserved to the federal government and specifically barred to them). This seems to make sense based on the shared cultural identity found in some states.Ideally the state government would have *less* power than the local communities. But logistically and economically the states are where the main power resides (Constitutionally speaking). This is as about as far removed as you would like the major power to be from the citizenry. Keep in mind that the length of California is 800 approximate miles (840 along the coast), which is further than Rome is to Paris. Which means the formation and scope of the states really needs a process to be reviewed. Up state New York has a very different cultural attitude than NYC. How we go about reforming states is a whole different discussion and is nearly impossible based on political climate and the restrictions in the Constitution. Though article 4 section 3 does allow it.So within this framework what is the role of the federal government? Interstate commerce? Pollution traveling from one state to another. Yes again, the role of the federal government is arbitration, not dictation. Organizations such as the EPA (beyond being unconstitutional) completely violate this principle. They should only act if there is a dispute between states. And arguably their action should only be through supplying information to congress that would settle the dispute with a law passed. That law would only stand up in a court if it was clear that the activities of one state were having a negative impact on another that seem unreasonable or avoidable. The EPA should be an information hub that does it's best to keep the states informed on the best practices to keep the environment clean in various ways. They should have zero regulatory authority, and congress should only act if there is a conflict among the states.And of course they will take care of defense, but what extent does the federal government play in "common interests"? Interstate highway system? Space program? Negotiating trade with other nations? All seem reasonable with little impact on the states that they represent. What about a minimum wage or welfare program? You start to see problems, as each state has a widely different culture, cost of living, charity, etc. /u/Yosoff made the interesting point that all federal revenue should be tied directly to the states. The open ended taxation of the people allows the federal government to ignore the interests of the states while executing these "common interests", which by definition makes them not common interests. It's seems an overhaul of the federal governments ability to collect taxes is necessary in order to maintain the scope of the federal governments job.Your interests are best taken care of by you. Disputes are best handled by the community body that is most capable of handling the dispute (local or state government). What would be the point of any world government? To handle disputes between nations. To provide defense if our planet becomes one of many (way off in the future if ever). To promote global common interests. And again the left (Agenda 21) would like to abuse that common interests to something that absolutely is not a common interest. Which means any such governmental body could/should be easily vetoed by any action it takes, or have it's funding completely reliant on the nations (as the United Nations is). And as I stated before how you ensure the leftists can't completely corrupt it is debatable and maybe impossible. They are ruthless in their search for tyranny and they cannot abide differing points of view.----Conclusion----I believe the founders had the right idea. But they were hung up on the selfish interests of the states at the time which inadvertently allowed the federalist system to shine. If we could some how perfect this concept further we could truly achieve a robust and happy Constitutional Republic. nan nan nan nan Where is it? The supposed party of the rich and corporations can't seem to bring any cash to bear in elections. It made sense under Obama and Democrats, as they were the party in power so they would get all the funds. We heard over the last two years the DNC was bankrupt, yet all the special elections they outspent Republicans 2 to 1.I thought Republicans were just saving it for the mid terms. But we were outspent in the mid terms, Democrats had enough money to throw around they were throwing tens of millions at Texas which really didn't stand a chance of flipping, but their money got it close.Are Republicans at odds with typical political funding sources? Why do the Democrats seem to have endless supplies of money? Trump proved you can win without spending lots of money, but he is an anomaly.  It recently occurred to me that our legal immigration system allows is a number of people every year at the same rate in which the abortion system is killing babies (nearly a million per year for both).Is this just a coincidence? We have serious population problems in this country, if it wasn't for immigrants and them having children our over all population would be shrinking.I guess the next question is: are current rates of immigration set by law? Or is it just the arbitrary amount that makes it through the system?Lastly are leftists more pro immigration due to the fact they and their children are more impressionable to far left indoctrination in our schools? People who have lived here for generations are going to be culturally rooted and less likely to buy into their marxist crap.Attached to the last question is the rise of young Americans who do not value freedom of speech and democracy (polling shows the lowest support amoung young people ever recorded) a result of immigration? For instance even are close cousins of countries Britain and Canada shit all over free speech, how can we ecpect any immigrants to share such values?----I support legal immigration due to the fact that they bring innovation and new ideas. Without them I think we would go stagnant. The issue I am seeing is a cultural divide that is very bad for our future. Assimilation seems unlikely in the current state of this country.What are your thoughts on this touchy topic? I know we have a few regulars who are legal immigrants. nan nan okay fellow conservatives, i know you could see this question coming a mile away.i think it's fair to say that most of us believe the banning of alex jones by multiple soc media platforms (and now mailchimp!) was coordinated.many right-of-center individuals are reacting with demands for the government to DO SOMETHING. we've seen this pattern often in the wake of something unsettling or scary: fear begets the knee jerk response for the government to intervene.but governmental response may be called for in this instance. my questions to you:1. do you believe that some response by the federal government is justified here? if so, what would such a response "look like"? does it mean, for instance, turning soc media into some kind of a utility? does it mean going back to net neutrality? or perhaps there's a legal precedent or regulation already on the books that you believe can address this situation?2. *on what grounds?* in other words, what provides the legal and/or moral groundwork for such a response?i look forward to your responses.NOTE: going to link to this from r/conservative to see if i can pull some more traffic to this sub. nan nan nan The left manages to hijack the national narrative yet again with their control over the main media outlets. How easily they manipulated a tragedy into:- Gun's need more control!- Gun Violence is on the rise!- NRA is an evil, evil, organization that is killing children!- Immediate action must be taken now!It was so bad this time that even conservatives were tripping over themselves to agree to the narrative. How hard is it to reject the leftist narrative out of hand? I know that takes coordination; but we've seen the left roll out the same talking points via the media for years after every shooting that catches headlines. How hard is it for us to be disciplined and ready to just shut it down? We saw the same bullshit under Obama with Zimmerman and Charleston. The left rolled out their fabricated and exaggerated narrative about blacks being gunned down in the streets in mass by police officers. We know it's bullshit; they know it's bullshit. Yet they were still able to dominate the national narrative with the framing of the issue completely in their favor.The common response from conservatives when these tragic stories come to light (as is inevitable within our flawed human existence):- This was horrible and the person who performed the violent attack is evil and deserves no infamy from the media.- Gun proliferation is no more an issue than car proliferation. It is horrible when people die as a result of them used, but the answer is not to ban or remove them.- End gun free zones for Concealed Carried licensed individuals. These people we trust to carry weapons throughout our society, they are already around our children on a day to day basis. These people can be both trained and ready to respond to such violent cowards who choose locations they know lack the ability to defend themselves.- Not a single gun regulation the left is proposing would have stopped this attack or the previous attacks they have politicized to push their agenda. They don't care as they have a particular agenda as stated by Obama, Hillary, Biden, and Pelosi of confiscating all guns in the United States similar to what Australia did. That is their end goal; they don't care if their measures effective or not as they aren't trying to solve the issue.----As for narrative control for our solutions:https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/80djh6/i_think_arming_teachers_is_not_a_bad_idea_ivanka/duus8cd/Ivanka uses the narrative of the left to support CCW in schools. That poster nails it in terms of how it should be framed.----I had hoped with the trust in media plummeting the ability of the left to control the national narrative would be diminished. I was wrong. Here we are again where they are dictating exactly what everyone is talking about. This power is one of the major reasons Romney lost in 2012 (among his many flaws).What can conservatives do to shut down this ability for the left to dictate national narratives? Should conservatives/Republicans be better prepared for the obvious sick tactics of the left to exploit such tragedies? And should the RNC have people on standby to flood onto the leftist media and be ready to shut down their narratives? And what do conservatives keep getting suckered into this? Do they not have political strategists? I know conservatives in congress like Cruz played it correctly; but a lot of moderate conservatives within the GOP fell for it hook line and sinker. It's harder and harder for me to see any redeeming qualities from the left. I do not watch/consume conservative media this is purely from the time since this subreddit was founded and investigating root causes and positions of the left and right.I had always bought into the notion that they were just trying to do what is right. Which is correct when you look at the average Joe/Jane from the left. They feel and act on emotion and proceed with causes that they feel are good and righteous. It's a moral crusade for them and you see it in every aspect of their lives. But they were put on the moral crusader path by the intellectual backers; who know the outcomes of their actions and the disastrous effect it has on the nation and on the people and they don't care.I'll create a list of areas in which these intellectual backers are doing horrific harm to our society and can only be doing so intentionally. I'll then explore a one of the topics on why it seems to be nefarious and sinister. If anyone wants to expand out on any of these topics; feel free as I can write about each. ----- **Justice, Courts, Rule of Law**. The left intentionally and overtly tries to subvert this. It's logical for why they do so; as the best way to implement their political reform is via judicial fiat. When the majority of American disagree with you you can ignore the Democratic Process and implement your change.- **Academia, Education, Advancement**. Place to learn and share ideas. A bastion of diversity of thought to allow debates and to aggressively weed out the ideas that are less worthy. It is also the de facto filter for success in this country. As it's very hard to advanced within our current society without going through higher education. They of course have squashed diversity of thought and have pushed diversity of values (good to evil). They have done this as their ideology is not competitive and they know it.- **Immigration and Multiculturalism**. They push higher and higher immigration with no thought to how much our population can absorb. Historically the numbers were low enough that we could absorb the incoming immigrants and those immigrants were fairly determined to succeed and integrate into our society. Our birth rates have been low enough over the last half century (due to Roe v. Wade and changes in economic structure) that the native traditional Americans are being replaced with first/second generation immigrants. Historically immigration is good as it keeps new and fresh blood coming in which helps us to innovate and adapt; but that is not the goal of the left here.- **Science, Facts, and Critical Thinking**. The left has pushed Critical Theory; which like most plays on language means the opposite of what you would think. They adopt the words of something understood and respect like Critical Thinking and twist it. We have seen whole swathes of science infected by Critical Theory to the point that things that are no where near factual are reported as factual. Theories or concepts that are far from fact or even having evidence to the effect are presented as if they do.- **Language and values**. Social Justice, State Capitalism, Gay Marriage, Critical Theory. Oxymoron after oxymoron; yet used as a serious form of discussion and manipulation be the left. There are hundred upon hundreds of terms being misused and redefined to break down communication and the basic means in which people interact. The latch onto things like "rights" as everyone likes the thought of a right and applies it to everything and anything that their political movement desires.- **Media, News, Mass Communication**. Fake News. There isn't a single news paper or news network that I can watch without seeing their narrative being pushed. They aren't interested in reporting on the news... they are interested in reporting on the narrative.- **Tribal politics**. Breaking up the nation into arbitrarily defined groups that they then pit against each other. It's an evil for of politics that saw its high mark in the KKK and the Nazis. Nearly every violent socialist revolution was built on such a political apparatus. It breeds hate and division and ultimately wide spread violence.- **History**. They either ignore history as if it didn't happen (when it doesn't fit their narrative) or they refine it to fit their narrative. I asked /r/askahistorian about this hoping one of them would be brave enough to speak out about the practice of pushing modern political discourse through revised history. Not a single response from a historian. Only some leftist shill who said it was perfectly fine to redefine history based on modern perceptions. This is being considered a legitimate practice of history now; fiction.- **Political funding malpractice**. Blatant and open corruption where you can literally trace the government money leaving the States/Federal government and going into the campaigns of Democrats. As in the lies that they are funded by "individual contributions" do not match up against the reality. Unions, especially public unions, donated over a billion dollars in the 2016 election to Democrats. All of that money was mandated by states like California that force people who work specific jobs to pay dues to these organizations.----Immigration and multiculturalism is a recent one that really started to make me think that there is nothing redeeming about the left (intellectual backers, not the useful idiots). The useful idiots are kept in line as they are told any opposition to this policy is "racist".https://www.reddit.com/r/ConservativeLounge/comments/7kaatt/have_more_babies/That thread deals with the heart of it. California has seen a net loss in traditional Americans for nearly 2 decades straight; yet the population of the state keeps growing. The state over those two decades has slid further and further to the left. We all assumed this was just California always being more liberal or just becoming more liberal. Hell Berkeley was always a leftist hell hole. The truth of the matter is California has been an all American state and was fairly moderate for the last 60+ years until recently. We had Reagan as governor, and Democrats typically governed from a moderate position. It swung back and forth but was never a one sided state.Then we saw Democrats gain solid control of the state legislature and we saw the slide began. We saw the amnesty from the 80's. And now we are seeing Californians fleeing the state and being replaced by first generation and second generation immigrants.Now I'll make this clear; it doesn't matter what race they are it matters what their culture and values are. It is a fact that first generation immigrants rarely are dedicated to American values even if they are pursuing integration within our society. Their children are typically more integrated but still have some cultural hold outs from their parents country of origin. Third generation is when you see the children not really knowing the language of their grandparents and fully enmeshed within American culture.The intellectual backers of the left know that birth rates among traditional Americans is *very* low. You need a birthrate of roughly 2.1 to stay even, estimates place the birthrate among 3rd+ generation immigrants at around 1.4-1.5. Which means the population as a total will shrink over time. The highest birthrates in the country are from first generation immigrants which are what push us up to a 2.1 birth rate nationally.Democrats like Jerry Brown are aware of all of this. What they have done since the 80's (as Democrats back then and even into the 90's were very much against illegal immigration and capping immigration) was formulated a plan to push the country to the left. They do this by pushing hard for increased immigration and amnesty. They follow this on by implementing a governmental and educational platform of multiculturalism. Meaning they don't want second generation or even third generation immigrants to integrate. As if they integrate they will oppose the cultural marxist shit policies.There is no other rational explanation for their political platform on the issue and their sudden changes on immigration in the 80's and 90's to present. They found they could convert California into a leftist hellhole via this method and they want to do the same to Texas as well. They are literally displacing Americans with the intent to "radically transform" this country. I have no issue with first generation immigrants and I feel it is important that our population will continue to grow (as is only possible with immigration right now). At the same time the government should be ensuring that immigrants coming are small enough that they can be absorbed and integrated into our country. So if we have declining birthrates via 3rd generation + immigrants we need to account for that among the immigration policy as well as taking measures to try and bolster those birthrates.There is no excuse for what the Democrats are pursuing in regards to immigration and multiculturalism. Again this is targeted at the intellectual backers of the left. The useful idiots have been duped into believing a diversity on all things (except thought) is important.----What are your thoughts on the nefarious/sinister scheming of the intellectual backers of the left? Are there any intellectual backers of the left? Or it a giant cluster fuck of emotional manipulation that results in these outcomes? nan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coUxrFnm0jwAndrew Klavan 10 minutes into the video states this has been one of the greatest years for conservatives since Reagan. Do you agree? If you don't; what years have been better for conservatives (especially in regards to government and politics)?Some of the things he lists:- ISIS Defeated.- 60 judges who are constitutionalists. And Gorsuch.- Regulation roll backs.- Tax plan that helps the tax system in the direction that we want.- Democrats have finally taken their immoral sex offenders to task. Clinton no long held on a pedestal even after the horrible acts he had committed.Klavan in regards to hating Trump: "What difference does it make whether or not you like the guy. It is pure emotionalism." There are a number of people who have let this cloud their judgment and critical thinking. Emotion should not dictate the choices you make. A lot of the emotional reactionaries to Trump have leveraged the future as some known quantity. Is that fair? Newt Gingrich is out saying the end is nigh. Is 2018 going to be a bad year for Republicans? Why? Is it anything more than the pendulum swing or underdog voting patterns of Americans?What do you think Republicans/Conservatives should be doing to minimize Democrat gains? Can they do anything? Is that realistic? Republicans out performed Trump in all of their elections in 2016 making it appear that they were independent to the so called "leader" of the party. Will that still be the case in 2018?Will the economy matter? Economic indicators are good. Though every stock market analyst has been saying constantly for the last year that there will be a "correction" incoming. If no such correction materializes will Democrats struggled in 2018 and 2020?What could go horribly wrong for Republicans? What could go amazingly right for Republicans? nan It's quite simple.  Roy Moore as a senator would be the best thing that ever happened to the left.He's everything they say Republicans and religious people are and then some.  He has ignored court orders and persisted in violating the separation of church and state.  He genuinely seems to be prejudiced against gay people.  He was thrown off the bench multiple times for his actions.  And most of all, he's a loud and proud Christian who is quite likely a child molester.He is everything the left thinks of us all rolled into a beautiful bundle.Republicans would have been clubbed over the head with "Moore Moore Moore Moore Moore" for every second he sat in the senate, and years afterwards.Obviously the best case scenario would have been if he had dropped out of the race after the upstanding president Trump had roundly denounced him, but that wasn't going to happen, so this was maybe second best.Jones will never sit in a majority Democrat senate since his term expires right away next election, and Alabama sure as heck won't be putting him back in, so at least he won't be able to do too much damage.Alabamans were forced to choose between a terrible person and a terrible agenda and begrudgingly chose a bad agenda, knowing they could vote for a good one again in a year and a half.Things will be fine for conservatives. Seems like there are a few positions to take on him:- 1.) He's clearly a pedophile; ensure his opponent wins to show how principled we are. Jeff Flakes openly donated to his abortion loving opponent and posted it online. He is so contemptible he needs to be stopped now even if it harms conservative policy going into the future.- 2.) He's likely was a pedophile at some point and has a lot to answer for. He is a disgusting human being; so like Ben Shapiro recommends do a write in or refuse to vote. Nearly 100% leading to Democrats taking the seat.- 3.) It's possible he's a pedophile and makes you feel very uneasy at having him serve in political office; especially as a Republican/Conservative. But the Senate balance is important. Elect him and allow more evidence to come forward or have him resign/removed from office afterwards to ensure a Republican takes the seat. The media clearly sat on this until the general election when they could have easily revealed it in the primaries and chose not to.- 4.) The Washington post is a leftist shitrag that is a propaganda arm of the Democratic Party. Their timing is suspect as well as the testimonies. While you think it is possible he maybe guilty; innocent until proven guilty is something you're willing to stand by here. You want to see hard evidence before you would be willing to remove your support or demand his resignation (after winning).- 5.) Clearly a leftist hit job with most of the "victims" being Democrats who actively campaigned for Hillary. You think it is unlikely that they said nothing for 30-40 years when he was a judge and was in the public sphere before; and then suddenly after the primaries in 2017 decided it was time to talk.----Where do you fall on the spectrum? I think I fall on 3, with the amount of testimonies that came forward he is likely guilty of pedophile and sexual assault. Democrats will of course try and smear Republicans when Moore wins the election (which is the whole reason Franken is being forced out so they can build their "moral high ground") but I think Shapiro is dead wrong on how effective that will be (as he has been wrong on Trump). Once we secure the seat we impeach his ass or have him resign and get a Republican replacement by the governor there.I do not see it good to reward shit leftist organizations like Washington Post that intentionally sat on the story until the general election so that they could rig it in favor of a Democrat. Absolutely disgusting and unethical on their side and they know it.----Edit: https://www.conservativereview.com/articles/levin-heres-the-democrats-sickening-cynical-franken-schemeSeems like Franken will resign "after" the election in Alabama. And with the coordinated statements calling for him to resign coming out it does appear to be a political ploy. They really want an upset in Alabama as that will give them a win they can call a mandate. The win in VA was a joke and they know it (as it was biased in their favor to begin with). But if they can claim a Republican seat they can act like the Republicans did when Brown took Kennedy's seat.Democrats are all in on this election right now.

Do you feel Trump has been a net positive or negative for conservatives in the culture war? Why? Shapiro and other NeverTrumpers felt that he would be horrible in this regard as he would drag conservatives down with him. Is this true? Do people regard Trump as a conservative?How do you guys feel about his speech to Poland and to the UN? Is he making progress against the left's cultural indoctrination institutions: Media, Education, Hollywood? Are some of these institutions self destructing on Trump instead of him actually doing anything? We have several cultural individuals approaching the political scene with humor. But has this been a historical weakness of the conservative movement? We had nearly an entire generation co-opted by the likes of Jon Stewart and his disingenuous ridicule. ----Are young people more likely to get involved in politics via humor? Does the left have a monopoly on humor? We look down our noses at memes; but are memes the best chance of humorous political appeal to young people? Is this an inherent problem with young people; and can it be fixed via better culture/education? Are older people also affected by such a cultural tactic? I don't know if you all have noticed this trendy label going around. I know I used to label myself this way when I was 17, "I'm fiscally conservative and socially liberal." I see that flair a lot on reddit, and something struck me recently about that, I wonder if it's a delusion.So it first came about when discussing universal health care. I was hearing all these "conservatives" advocating for it, or at least not vehemently opposing it. Universal health care pulls government into territory in which it doesn't belong, it is expanding the government, even when utilizing the private sector.Now I can see a conservative stance that argues the inevitability of a single payer system, I can respect that and then shift the discussion towards how to best handle a single payer system as equitably and cheaply as possible while trying to let the free market work it's magic. That's fair.I can even see a conservative arguing that while it does expand the government, that it would cut costs and end up being a relatively inexpensive net gain for everyone, and simply turning a blind eye to this one, non-conservative move. I can respect that opinion and still think the person is a conservative, though I think it is really faulty logic.But what troubles me is this argument that cost-effectiveness supersedes justice (or perhaps it's equated to justice) in the minds of these people who call themselves "Fiscally conservative, socially liberal." Perhaps justice doesn't enter into this... or they look at this is social justice, which makes some sense.And so I thought on it a bit and I made the point in a threat somewhere and I asked if "Fiscally conservative" just means someone who believes in getting the most bang for your buck. Through their writing I could sense they cocked their brown and tilted their head in bewilderment, "...it's not?" And then expressly stated that it simply meant to them that it was about cost effectiveness.But here is this monicker that seems to straddle the fence between the left and the right, but I'm starting to think these are basically leftists who see that we can't just go throwing money around. They're like Costco socialists.And the more I thought about the sillier that stance seemed to be. I mean I've heard a lot of conservative ideas that allow for homosexual marriage... I've heard a lot of conservative ideas that allow for legalization of marijuana and other drugs (generally it's a state's rights issue). I've heard so many arguments that end up allowing things for which the left tends to believe they've monopolized advocacy. So I hear conservative voting for gay marriage in California, or supporting gay marriage in NY, and yet this still falls under this "socially liberal" category in the minds of a lot of people, despite the fact that many came to those conclusions through a strict adherence to conservative values.So that seems to make the term "Socially liberal" in this "Socially liberal, fiscally conservative" label useless being that both sides can argue for many of the same things.So "Socially Liberal" seems like a meaningly distinction consider conservatives have conservative reasons for supporting things like Gay marriage. And "Fiscally Conservative" isn't really conservatism in the political philosophy sense of the word, rather it just means "frugal". So when you unpack all that, does this label actually mean anything?It seems like it's just a slow ride down the socialism road, paved in the good intentions of saving people money through very bad but easily sellable soft government intervention like Obamacare.So is the "fiscal conservative/socially liberal" stance a valid one, or is it just the indecision of people who would rather not pick a side? Video by Crowder about Rights vs. Commodities (or privileges).https://youtu.be/IlnzIHmI0fEIn the past we have covered topics dealing with the left's misuse of language in order to control the narrative. "Rights" being their big "fill good" term that they abuse to its bitter end on almost anything that they want. Want Marriage redefined? Call it a right. Want basic social definitions like gender to no longer be used? Call it a right to have a subjective description.When the left claims a right to a commodity; like healthcare, is that just another term for Socialization of said commodity? If the Constitution gave a right to attorney at all times; and not just in cases of criminal defense; you have just socialized all law firms. You don't see the vast legions of lawyers who support Democrats making this argument. Instead they have declare that healthcare services are a right.So what happens when you declare a good or service a "right". You have taken something that has fundamentally limited quantity and extended it infinitely to all people for as many times as they wish to use it. It ignores scarcity and it ignores incentives to provide for those scarcities. This inevitably leads to shortages. ----So what is a good way to confront leftists on subjects like that? The left rolls out the feel good "well you don't want people to die right? Think of grandma!""Ignoring scarcity and incentives to address scarcity leads to shortages. Not only will grandma still die but so will little Timmy."The left then responds with "Well we can have a regulatory body that ensures scarcity is addressed"."Central planning has been proven a failure in comparison to markets 100 fold over. It takes too long for data to reach bureaucrats and then for those bureaucrats to process the data and to finally issue regulations to address the scarcity. And by the time they issue a regulation to address the scarcity; it is no longer scarce and they are regulating the over production of a service/good that is no longer needed".I have already seen this type of narrative being pushed. Problems with ACA? They want more regulations and more central planning to address the problems caused by what they implemented. It is a fundamental distrust in a free market; and this distrust in the free market is going to slowly destroy this country. They would rather do what feels good or do something that makes them feel in control of the problem; instead of doing what works the best which is the free market system. nan nan Open discussion. Talk about what's on your mind. Thinking we may do a countdown here.  We'll start with the second half of the 20th century this week.  I think it would be cool to have these things indexed by time period.  We've got a lot of interesting stuff politically and culturally in the latter half of the 20th century through the present. nan nan Okay, broadly and philosophically, I'm looking for a new Milton Friedman... but you just don't get someone like that every generation, do you?But specifically, I'm looking for any youtube video (or book) where Friedman details his opinion concerning publicly owned/operated utilities, like power, gas, and phone services. He's not only (basically) always right, he does a better job a breaking down to the lowest common denominator the REASON why he's right.... and I'm working on reevaluating my opinions on this particular topic.Anyone know of anything? Any topic welcome. Yosoff appears to be on vacation.  https://www.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/FBIStatementfromthePressSecretary20170509.pdfhttps://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/politics/fbi-director-james-b-comeys-termination-letters-from-the-white-house-attorney-general/2430/Looks like a solid set of reasoning from the deputy AG. Thoughts? Win for the rule of law? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLI-RxLBnVUWe have talked about leftists and their misuse of words many times in the culture war threads. He attacks it at the root here; communism is not compassionate misguided people; it is greedy narcissistic people who feel that everything they want should be provided to them. He also makes it clear (though does little in this clip to back it up) that this is not a "fringe" movement on the left. This is dominating most college campuses as well as the Democratic Party Platform. Bernie Sanders nearly won the primary and a lot of people who voted for Hillary only did so because they though Hillary stood a better chance of winning not that they disagreed with his evil ridiculously inept platform.As previous culture war threads have talked about we conservatives should not cede the moral authority on these subjects. Don't let the left dress themselves up as compassionate, especially since in the same breath they are typically claiming we are greedy and evil. Losing the moral argument makes our effectual based arguments of logic and rational near useless as large parts of the population will tune us out because of the perceived moral failure.This does seem to be in conflict with my posts regarding Rules of Radicals. Which I state that we should be cautious with moral purity positions. You can have the high ground morally, without having a perceived purity test that can be used to undermine you. From the infamously stupid quote "I have the high ground"; it has merits within this philosophical discussion. If you have ceded the moral high ground no matter how good of a political argument you make won't matter. nan Heard that something that was going on with him. Prager University Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzbJn2UAoIs----Relevant to the culture war of repeating a lie until it is accepted as fact. This rules of radical tactic is being used by the left on nearly every subject and should be confronted and debunked before it takes root in common culture. The current conspiracy theory campaign about Russia and Trump is one such example. And while their lunacy seems like it will be harmless it does have far reaching consequences if we let them go unchecked. The intellectual backers know they are lies and are intentionally pushing the lies as it benefits their political agenda. The useful idiots take them and run with it while often times knowing they are lies but they just don't care. Meanwhile apolitical people hear them enough they start repeating them as commonly known facts.You can find this tactic used by the left successfully from Climate Change to discrediting non-leftist media outlets. It is commonly believed now that Pence support electroshock therapy for gays and that Cruz is a Dominionist. That is how effective this tactic is. Intelligent people are not immune to this form of manipulation.----Crowder and other culture warriors do a good job of debunking this non-sense. But they have limited viewership and reach. It is important that we all recognize this tactic from the get go and be wary of it. That doesn't mean what they are talking about doesn't have hints of truth; but more often than not it is a large turd of a lie with a few dressings of truth to try and make it appear legitimate.What's some of the left's most egregious uses of this tactic? What are some instances of the right using this? What is the best way to insulate the population to this type of propaganda? nan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dd5YhWzJjgSome interesting points brought up in the video:1. The number of people who were added to medicare (Obamacare's biggest success) was actually much smaller than what was reported. Most of the people who signed up were already eligible... So the "increased coverage" being the biggest talking point of Democrats is highly exaggerated.2. Research indicates that the "defenders" of Obamacare generally came from 100 entities on the internet. This follows the trend of fully paid for shills that we come to expect from the left. Astroturf and fake to its very core.Republicans still haven't repealed what should theoretically be an easy repeal to do. Are the Republicans as cowardly as mentioned in this video or are they politically wise enough to see a political storm as a fallout from the repeal? Should a replacement be ready before they repeal? Or should it be repealed purely on the merits of its terrible passage, its terrible implementation, and the fact that it's a failure on nearly all marks? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FU7uei4HtXwInteresting discussion point brought up by PragerU. Are these iconic revolutionary stories critical to the "American Identity"? And have the left intentionally undermined ignored them in order to destroy the American Identity? I'm 32 and I do recall learning about Paul Revere in history; but I don't believe this poem was ever read in either History or English.----Paul Revere's RideHenry Wadsworth Longfellow, 1807 - 1882 Listen, my children, and you shall hearOf the midnight ride of Paul Revere,On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-Five:Hardly a man is now aliveWho remembers that famous day and year.He said to his friend, "If the British marchBy land or sea from the town to-night,Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry-archOf the North-Church-tower, as a signal-light,--One if by land, and two if by sea;And I on the opposite shore will be,Ready to ride and spread the alarmThrough every Middlesex village and farm,For the country-folk to be up and to arm."Then he said "Good night!" and with muffled oarSilently rowed to the Charlestown shore,Just as the moon rose over the bay,Where swinging wide at her moorings layThe Somerset, British man-of-war:A phantom ship, with each mast and sparAcross the moon, like a prison-bar,And a huge black hulk, that was magnifiedBy its own reflection in the tide.Meanwhile, his friend, through alley and streetWanders and watches with eager ears,Till in the silence around him he hearsThe muster of men at the barrack door,The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,And the measured tread of the grenadiersMarching down to their boats on the shore.Then he climbed to the tower of the church,Up the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,To the belfry-chamber overhead,And startled the pigeons from their perchOn the sombre rafters, that round him madeMasses and moving shapes of shade,--By the trembling ladder, steep and tall,To the highest window in the wall,Where he paused to listen and look downA moment on the roofs of the town,And the moonlight flowing over all.Beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead,In their night-encampment on the hill,Wrapped in silence so deep and stillThat he could hear, like a sentinel's tread,The watchful night-wind, as it wentCreeping along from tent to tent,And seeming to whisper, "All is well!"A moment only he feels the spellOf the place and the hour, and the secret dreadOf the lonely belfry and the dead;For suddenly all his thoughts are bentOn a shadowy something far away,Where the river widens to meet the bay, --A line of black, that bends and floatsOn the rising tide, like a bridge of boats.Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride,On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.Now he patted his horse's side,Now gazed on the landscape far and near,Then impetuous stamped the earth,And turned and tightened his saddle-girth;But mostly he watched with eager searchThe belfry-tower of the old North Church,As it rose above the graves on the hill,Lonely and spectral and sombre and still.And lo! as he looks, on the belfry's height,A glimmer, and then a gleam of light!He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,But lingers and gazes, till full on his sightA second lamp in the belfry burns!A hurry of hoofs in a village-street,A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,And beneath from the pebbles, in passing, a sparkStruck out by a steed that flies fearless and fleet:That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light,The fate of a nation was riding that night;And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,Kindled the land into flame with its heat.He has left the village and mounted the steep,And beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep,Is the Mystic, meeting the ocean tides;And under the alders, that skirt its edge,Now soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge,Is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides.It was twelve by the village clockWhen he crossed the bridge into Medford town.He heard the crowing of the cock,And the barking of the farmer's dog,And felt the damp of the river-fog,That rises when the sun goes down.It was one by the village clock,When he galloped into Lexington.He saw the gilded weathercockSwim in the moonlight as he passed,And the meeting-house windows, blank and bare,Gaze at him with a spectral glare,As if they already stood aghastAt the bloody work they would look upon.It was two by the village clock,When be came to the bridge in Concord town.He heard the bleating of the flock,And the twitter of birds among the trees,And felt the breath of the morning breezeBlowing over the meadows brown.And one was safe and asleep in his bedWho at the bridge would be first to fall,Who that day would be lying dead,Pierced by a British musket-ball.You know the rest. In the books you have read,How the British Regulars fired and fled,--How the farmers gave them ball for ball,From behind each fence and farmyard-wall,Chasing the red-coats down the lane,Then crossing the fields to emerge againUnder the trees at the turn of the road,And only pausing to fire and load.So through the night rode Paul Revere;And so through the night went his cry of alarmTo every Middlesex village and farm,--A cry of defiance, and not of fear,A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,And a word that shall echo forevermore!For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,Through all our history, to the last,In the hour of darkness and peril and need,The people will waken and listen to hearThe hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,And the midnight message of Paul Revere.----Does this poem illicit anything from you to a rooted culture and terror of that time? Or are we too far removed to care about such things anymore? The British aren't so bad; they're our best allies now? Is it hard for us to imagine a time of such tyranny that it once was on our door step?How do we ensure that this culture and shared history does not fade away and that our National Identity remains? Do we lack more modern and relevant stories? Star spangled banner being from the war of 1812 means nothing to generations of people who live today; though still a touching anthem to hear. Even the pledge of allegiance seems to be something that no one takes seriously or even cares about. And do all of these things require an external threat in order to generate emotion and unity among the population? Without real and credible threats; are the concepts of actual rights and liberties and of our national identity impossible to impart to the people of today? nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan This thesis covers the history of the Ninth and Tenth Amendments from the pre-Constitution guiding principles and the intentions of the Founders through centuries of legal challenges to the modern (mis)interpretations, from an originalist point of view.One can definitely tell this was written by a younger Ted Cruz.  Many parts have the conciseness that defines his communication style, while other parts struggle to reach complete clarity.  It is thorough, well-documented, and insightful.  Overall, it is one of the finest guides to understanding these amendments you will ever read.---- The title fittingly alludes the the James Madison quote;  "*If men were angels, no government would be necessary.  If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.  In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.*"He starts by defining "powers" and "rights" within the context of the Constitution, because, "*Each concept is distinct, and it is only through laxity of language that they are confused.*"* Rights - Rights are legal claims against government exercising of powers.  Rights have two characteristics- against what government it is claimed and against what power it is claimed.  A right to free speech is a claim against government suppression.  * Powers - Powers are the ability to control another; it is "legal authority."  Governments have powers and exercise them over people, institutions (collections of people), and subsidiary governments.  Hence each of the three can have rights in relation to the government exercising power.  Obligatory discussion of the Federalists/Anti-Federalists debate over the Bill of Rights.  The Federalists argued that because the federal government had no powers outside of those explicitly enumerated there was no need to explicitly list rights.  The rights were already protected by the lack of powers.  The Anti-Federalists argued that governments naturally expand their powers over time and that essential rights could be violated within the already enumerated powers through the *means* chosen to exercise the authorized power.With the creation of a Bill of Rights there was a concern that the presumption would be reversed, implying that the federal government suddenly had the power to do everything not explicitly prohibited.  Thus the need for the Ninth and Tenth Amendments.* 9th: *The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.*  * 10th: *The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.*Notice that the Ninth deals with rights (claims against government powers) while the Tenth deals with powers (legal authority of government).* The 14th was interpreted to expand the rights of the first eight Amendments to be claims against the powers of the individual states.  *...No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States...*After ratification, the Ninth Amendment was ignored, not becoming a part of a majority Supreme Court decision until a Ninth Amendment claim was rejected in 1936.  The first time a Ninth Amendment right was affirmed was in 1965 when the Supreme Court struck down a Connecticut statute on contraceptives in *Griswold v. Connecticut*.  Prior to the Fourteenth Amendment this ruling would have been impossible as the Bill of Rights did not provide claims against state powers, only against federal powers.  In addition, the Tenth Amendment reserved unenumerated powers to the states, giving the states the power to ban contraceptives if it so desires.  Suddenly the Supreme Court had discovered vast new authority with the combination of the Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments.  It could declare a new unenumerated right through the Ninth and apply it against state power through the Fourteenth.  This completely bypasses the delegation of powers to the individual states through the Tenth Amendment, rendering it toothless.Through the pretext of protecting individual rights the Supreme Court grants the Judicial Branch of the federal government new powers against which the subsidiary states have no rights."*The fourth thing to consider is the damage to the structure of the Constitution that would be done (or is done) by construing the Fourteenth as conferring upon judges unlimited power to create new rights, i.e., invalidate other government powers, at will.  Such a construction would render meaningless the checks and balances in our government, would skew the separation of powers, and would alienate the republican principles of the Constitution by giving greatest authority to non-elected, non-representative judges.*"  "*Additionally, the Fourteenth should especially not be thought of as applying the Ninth and Tenth Amendments to the states. To apply the Tenth would be completely non-sensical, and to apply the Ninth would be to treat state governments of general jurisdiction as if they were governments of enumerated powers.  It would essentially apply a limitation of federalism against the very states meant to be protected by that federalism.*  ***The Ninth and Tenth are rules of construction - of construing the powers of and the rights against the federal government.  Therefore it is foolish to think they can or should apply to the states.***"While Ted Cruz stops short of calling the Supreme Court self-appointed philosopher-kings with carte blanche authority, he strongly hints that they may become that if they haven't already.----[PDF "for research purposes only" version is available for $5 from the Princeton University Library.](http://dataspace.princeton.edu/jspui/handle/88435/dsp01js956g50t)  The order process is a bit odd, but they are quick and polite. If you didn't already know an article V allows for 2/3rds of the States to call for a Constitutional Convention and make changes to the constitution. I have three things I'd change *1) Balanced Budget, *2) Get rid of the Militia section of the Second Amendment and *3) Term Limits (maybe 6 years for house, 12 for Senate and obviously 8 for President) Note: *This is an opinion post.  The purpose of this post is to provide a starting point for a substantial discussion.*  ----  ***Principles***  * The immigration policy of any country should be based solely on what is in the best interest of the current citizens of that country.  * There is a significant difference between legal immigration and illegal immigration.  * Illegal activity should be punished, not rewarded.  This includes illegal hiring practices.  * The chance of conviction and punishment must be sufficient to deter illegal activity.  * Immigration policy should not discriminate based on race, religion, or country of origin.  * Immigration policy should factor in the applicant's ability to provide for themselves (and their family), ability to assimilate to American culture, ability to contribute to society, health status, and criminal history.  * Immigration policy should require proof of identity, criminal history, medical history, and any other relevant information.* The conjugal (nuclear) family unit is the foundation of society and keeping families united should be a consideration.  * All people are endowed with Natural Rights and should be treated with respect and dignity.    ----  ***Political Realities***    * Democrats have already reneged on securing the border as promised in two separate immigration reform deals.  The assumption must be made that they are negotiating in bad faith.  Guarantees, verification, and enforcement of all aspects of any deal must be ironclad.  * Nobody knows the current size of the illegal immigrant population.  The estimation of 11 million has been tossed around for nearly a decade.  It could be anywhere from 10 - 20 million.  * The American public, with a manipulative media, will not tolerate the forced deportation of 10 - 20 million people. * Encouragement for self-deportation is politically feasible.   * The majority of illegal immigrants would vote Democrat if they were to become citizens.  The Republican Party cannot support any deal that would grant citizenship or voting rights.  * Increasing the supply of labor, whether low-skilled or high-skilled, reduces the cost of labor (wages).  * Big donors and lobbyists looking to reduce labor costs hold a great deal of influence over both parties.  * The United States is nearly $20,000,000,000,000.00 in debt and the entitlement programs are already at a breaking point.  * The United States currently accepts far more legal immigrants in real numbers than any other country and there is a limit to how many immigrants the country can support.  A 2012 Gallup poll estimated that 150,000,000 people would immigrate to the United States if given the opportunity.  The U.S. currently has a population of 319,000,000. Not everyone who wants to come here can come here.   * Excessive immigration has had a strong negative effect on many school systems.  * Excessive immigration has had a strong negative effect on the American culture and identity.  * American drug policy has been part of the problem.    ----  ***Potential Solutions***    * Secure the borders first with whatever force is necessary to completely stop illegal immigration via border crossings.  * Implement a Visa tracking system.  Crossing the border is not the only form for illegal immigration.  The tracking system has already been mandated by law; it must now be implemented to prevent people from entering on a Visa and staying illegally.  * Restrict entitlement programs to citizens only.  Cut all entitlement funding to states which do not enforce the citizenship mandate.  * Implement and mandate a national employment eligibility verification system.  * Once the policies listed above have been fully implemented and verified, grant legal permanent resident status to all remaining illegal immigrants.  This status will have no path to citizenship.  In order to gain citizenship they will need to apply from their country of origin (embassies do count) and start at the back of the line like everyone else.  * Implement an English as the national language law with the option for individual states to declare secondary official state languages.  * Reform the existing legal immigration process to streamline immigration for people with critically needed skills and throttle immigration for people with skills that are in low demand.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPgDUE8ky_oI'm not fully through this video, it's a old one from a few years back with Ben Shapiro talking about his various books and his life. The following are points brought up by Shapiro that I think are interesting and worthy of having a discussion on. Feel free to talk about any of these topics.1.) Conservatives bad at telling a story? (**Culture**) Rate yourself at this. Do you feel that when making arguments you fail to develop a story to support your argument? This is 100% emotional, but maybe incredibly important for a persuasive argument.a.) Conservatives are bad at presenting a good image? (Culture) Obama being a media trained politician (teleprompters) was acutely aware of this strength. As Shapiro points out in the video that Republicans often come off as tired old assistant principles. Should Republicans be a lot more focused on presentation than they currently are?2.) Conservatives bad at character arguments? (**Culture**) Rate yourself. When attacking Democrats should Conservatives be better at making character arguments against them since the left is continuously using them against us? It shows time and again that those who play nice during an election tend to lose. Look who came out on the Republican side? Trump who used character assassinations from the get go on any opponent that got in his way. Look at the Democratic side? Hillary who has also done the same. Shapiro brings up the good point that Reagan was very effective at driving character attacks on Jimmy Carter, he wasn't just all sunshine and rainbows. Both McCain and Romney did the "play nice" method and allowed the left to character assassinate them while Obama skated through the election unharmed. Should we continue to play this high ground?a.) Conservatives bad at appealing to emotions? The "feelings" of the voter. (**Culture**). Is this the reason we are losing the culture war as we rarely appeal to emotions? The pro-life movement definitely does appeal to emotion, but many of the other positions in regards to foreign policy, immigration, entitlements we come off with effectiveness arguments and lack the emotional arguments to win over people to our causes.3.) Individual actions have a severe impact on the person performing them? (**Social**). This is a social conservative argument, I know we have a lot of libertarian conservatives, feel free to express your opinions on this. Shapiro makes the point that every action a person takes has a serious impact psychologically on the person taking them. Teenagers having oral sex via peer pressure, a young woman talked into an abortion by Planned Parenthood (which has an above 90% rate in which they counsel women on pregnancies that end in an abortion). We have a culture of "let them do whatever they want" without any consider for the damage being done to said person and the ultimate damage being done to society because of it. Regardless of whether or not you think the government should be involved in it, as a society/culture should this be something encouraged or should it be discouraged?4.) Conservatives lack an enemy after the fall of the Soviet Union (**Culture**). The three legs lost a common cause (Social/Fiscal/Foreign Policy) Democrats have always cast conservatives as the enemy and who Americans should be afraid of. So conservatives have nothing really to unite them while Democrats continue to demonize conservatives as their rallying point. Shapiro makes the point that by every metric voters thought (via exit polls) Romney was better suited to be president than Obama. Yet voters feared what he would do. They would rather have an incompetent president like Obama than a competent president that may be out to get them personally. Where back when the Soviet Union existed and Republicans used that as their Boogeyman for unification there was a real fear of the Communist State and their military/nuclear power. Terrorism kind of acted as the unifier shortly after 9/11 but has failed to maintain a hold (which is why Democrats undermine Terrorism every chance they get get, as they know that Republicans/Conservatives greatly benefit politically when terrorism is a top concern for Americans). Should we be demonizing the left and their cultural immoral root of socialism which they represent?5.) Is it legitimate for the government to lend a helping hand to those who are severely disadvantaged? A child who is born to a 16 year old with a 4th grade reading level? That child is pretty much fuck in terms of our society. What can be done? What should be done? (**Fiscal, Social, Culture**)6.) College indoctrination. (**Culture**) if a kid leaves for college without a solid foundation on principles and beliefs they are most likely to be a liberal when they leave is an argument Shapiro makes on a regular basis. Wouldn't a huge national push by conservative to institute good clubs and educational programs at high schools be the best method to counteract liberal indoctrination in colleges? I know that I had conservative positions as early on as Jr. High and was a staunch conservative before I went to college. So my hyper liberal professors attempts to persuade my class to their positions was very obvious and had no impact on me. ----Again I'm attempting to encourage discussion. Be willing to challenge your own beliefs and perceptions as we are all conservatives there isn't some threat to it. This subreddit doesn't exist as a echo chamber to just pronounce your beliefs on a subject. Where is the benefit in that? You should understand your values and positions all the way to their root and debating/discussing the subjects is the best way to flesh that out. And if there is a subject you just aren't very knowledgeable on feel free to ask questions.Edit: Oh and if any of these subjects look really interesting we can branch out into their own posts if we want. The CBO projects the Federal budget baseline to include automatic adjustments for inflation and anticipated increases in program participation. [The baseline increase is typically around +5%.](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/images/pubs-images/49xxx/49892-land-table1.png)The GDP growth rate for the 2nd quarter was 1.4% and the 3rd quarter is projected to be 1.1%.This means that if the Federal Government is left on autopilot it WILL collapse the economy.The particularly nasty thing about baseline budgeting is the politics.  If a politician wants to increase spending by only 3% instead of 5% they are villainized as a crazy tax cutter who hates the poor and elderly.  On the flip side, if politicians agree to only increase spending 4% then they will pat themselves on the back and tell the voters how they are fiscal hawks who cut spending and saved billions. nan We've created a game called ‚ÄúVirtual Congress‚Äù (VC) on Discord. You start out as a member of Congress that can create and vote on legislation and nominations to the cabinet or supreme court. You also can run for president or try to become a leader in Congress. It‚Äôs a fun way to debate policy or create policy and see how other members think about it. Also, we have a budget so if your bill passes and it affects the budget, you can see the consequences. Check us out! https://discord.gg/eZVzzrS  [https://youtu.be/asO9HFHeeeg ](https://youtu.be/asO9HFHeeeg)Mick Mulvaney and conservatives are launching an all out war on Republicans and Democrats working together to create a federal budget. Their goal is to cut government spending by getting the government to extend continuing resolutions indefinitely. On the other hand, both democrats and republicans want to pass a budget, but‚Ä¶ as you can imagine, they have a few things they need to work out if they‚Äôre going to agree. The recent sudden dismissal of all charges in a clear and obvious corrupt way had everyone left and right screaming about it.Seems pretty convienient with the bomb shell release of the Mueller report destroying the leftist myth of collusion between Trump and Russia. A story that if it dominanted the news cycle could cost Democrats across the board in 2020.Is it a coincidence? nan I recently got invited to join the civilists sub and after researching them a little bit they come off as monarchists with a touch of national socialism and populism mixed in.  Because of this I told them that I couldn‚Äôt be associated with there movement in good conscious.  Is my surface level glance at this accurate?  Did I judge them wrong?  Has anyone else received similar invites? nan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7oFbWhGwNwKnowles makes this quote around the 2 minute mark. Is this true in politics? Does this come from not letting the opposition ‚Äúset the narrative‚Äù or the ‚Äúcontext of discussion‚Äù. Ben Shapiro talked about this years ago and has recently completely failed in regards to this. In the matter of politics and media responses, if you are in a position where you have to ‚Äúexplain‚Äù something do you lose politically?Knowles seems to suggest this is a part of Trump‚Äôs genius as he ensures he never has to explain himself to anyone. Yeah he blusters a lot, but he does that every day. Thus he never falls into the tap of explaining within the context of the hostile question. nan nan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZnAneMJg5E&t=0sThis guy does an interesting rant on inherent value in regards to human life and abortion arguments. A lot of his conclusions are right where mine are at that I had come to on my own (as I'm agnostic and evaluated it from my own basis of ethics).His points out that their biggest failure of an argument for pro-abortion is that a unborn human is "not a person". Not just because it is wrong (as is all their arguments) because even if you accept this premise it still fails.----What I think he fails to understand is that the left *does not value human life*. His assumption is that they do. His example of bald eagle eggs or sea turtle eggs illustrates this. They value endangered species more than they do another human.Nearly all leftist movements from communism to Fascism devalues human life as it must come secondary to their agenda and goals. But that isn't the only driver there. We have talked about this before on this forum: Agenda 21. A UN political thought that focuses on Over population and resources scarcity. The left has been screaming about this since the 60's; and entire generations of Americans have been raised with this garbage taught as fact.It's stems from their inability to predict the future in chaotic systems; thus because they cannot predict dynamic feedbacks they perceive humans unable to alter their behavior before catastrophic outcomes occur. Thus central planning, ivory tower elites, must plan and "fix" these problems for the "masses" for their "own good".Why does this lead to the inherent value of humans been diminished? Because their greatest fear and threat to Earth and everything is *more humans*. Quite literally humans are the evil; or as the Matrix's Agent Smith stated "A Virus". If the very growth of our population is evil; then there is no inherent value for human life. Eugenics starts sounding appealing.----The idea that the left does not agree that human life has inherent value is so abhorrent this man is unable to comprehend it.What do you think? Obviously this is a "broad stroke". When I refer to the left I refer to the intellectual backers for the left. Not the useful idiots or every day Joe that associates with leftist politics. Most of them have not thought through it and are being manipulated by emotional appeal. Those who have thought it through and maintain their position do so because they do not believe in inherent value of human life.There was a poll conducted a few years ago. A majority of millennial when faced with their own dog drowning and a human stranger; they by a significant margin opted to save their own dog over the human stranger.Outside of my own arguments; what did you think of the video author's discussion on inherent value? http://www.theimaginativeconservative.org/2018/04/new-barbarism-learning-twenty-first-century-schools-tony-williams-timeless.htmlI think we can all agree that schools are one of the most important institutions in our society.  I think almost everyone agrees that our schools could be drastically better than they are currently.  Is returning to a more classical style of education an answer?  Is this something conservatives should be pushing for? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=743EjjA_iO8Good dicussion on the left's tactic of shutting down discussion. I know personally I started to see this on Climate Change for the first time; but I imagine that wasn't the first topic the left abused this on. "The debate is over" is what they said. "Science is settled".  Al Gore refused to debate anyone on the topic; the left pretended as if they had already won an argument they never had. It's an assertion of truth, knowledge, and a false fact of intellectual rigor.----What is free speech to you? At what point is dumb speech not worth dealing with? Is there ever a point in terms of public political discourse for one side to claim they have no reason to engage their opposition? For instance the left says Capitalism is a failure and needs to be abolished. We may from the outside think such a statement absolutely absurd and ignorant; but if there are a number of people who believe it we should always be willing to engage in discourse to show them why and how they are wrong. nan nan I was watching some of the Louder with Crowder "Change my mind" series and there was a common issue that came up in the discussions. "Well my statistics say this". Crowder was doing the same; though his sources were better sourced and were usually involving national data bases like the FBI but it still led to an impasse in a discussion.----In a debate statistics are important as they bring a non-anecdotal basis for a societal argument. Then there is the problem of Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics. It is very easy for leftist think tanks to produce statistics that are either completely made up or so incredibly context cropped that it produces the conclusion that they are going for.One metric we have been obsessing on in recent years are "polls" in an attempt to capture human metrics on various positions. And just like statistics; these are manipulated by how the questions are asked. One prominent example that I have been using myself is Pro-Choice vs. Pro-Life. Everyone believes that the country is near evenly divided on the issue of abortion; and this couldn't be further from the truth. Yearly polling from Gallup shows "identification" of Pro-Choice and Pro-Life floating around 50%. This is true; because that is how the question is framed. And in modern political discourse if you're a Democrat you are likely to say you are pro-choice without knowing what that means; the same can be said of a Republican. It's a very partisan issue.Though when that same poll dives down into specifics such as: "No Restrictions", "Few Restrictions", "Few Allowances," "No Allowance" you see the true break down of the population on the abortion debate. For the last 20 years nearly 55-60% of the population has been solidly in the "Few Restrictions" and "No Allowance" category. 40% coming from the "Few" category which typical allows abortions in an extreme minority of current cases like rape, life of the mother, severe genetic defects, etc.Yet in public discourse if you asked a Democrat what they thought the population break down on the issue was they would tell you that Pro-choice makes up 55% of the country (of a even larger percent that is completely disconnected from reality).----So how then do we talk to people who don't even deal in the same realm of "facts" as we do? You're going to cite the statistics/facts and they are gong to cite their statistics and facts. Then they are going to cite their "fact checkers". Now Steven doesn't bother to go down that rabbit hole in his discussions. And I don't either. I find link spamming really takes away from the discussion; even though the facts are relevant and are necessary for forming an opinion. At the same time I spam 20 links; and they spam 20 links back telling me how my links are wrong or are "propaganda".Critical thinking is clearly the skill set that needs to be employed in this dilemma. But many Americans are severely lacking in that department.----What are your thoughts on the fact that any discussion can be googled and their "Talking Points" and "Statistics" can be regurgitated as facts where both sides are obviously contradicting each other on them? President Trump has asked the Justice Department to compose a law that would ban accessories that modify semi-automatic weapons to behave similarly to fully automatic weapons.Example: [Bump Stock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6oaRAgdslE&feature=youtu.be&t=2m0s)  Example: [Gat Crank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jif4Wo0LDX8&feature=youtu.be&t=2m34s)Both can easily fire over 600 rounds per minute which is the rate of fire of a [fully automatic AK-47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egmmrHG8XZo&feature=youtu.be&t=1m18s).----Things to consider:The effectiveness of such a ban.Constitutional / Second Amendment issues at play.  The incrementalist approach to degrading those protections.The political impacts. I said [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/conservatives/comments/7sn7fd/patients_dying_in_hospital_corridors_uk/dt65onx/) over in another sub. My question is in the title of this post. Does the federal government have a role in public health and, if so, what are the limits on this role? Should it get involved in research and if so, what are the "bright red line tests" that should circumscribe that involvement or indicate that it's time for the federal government to step in?should this be limited to the states and are there similar limits to when state governments should get involved? case in point, the hep A crisis in san diego.the obvious context for my remarks is the H3N2 virus but we can take this in any number of directions, from cancer to HIV to PTSD.curious to hear your thoughts. How should immigration be handled for the United States?----- Educated or Wealthy?- Those who can perform work Americans no longer want to do?- Culturally adaptable/similar?- Numbers based on American birth rates? Linearly correlated or inverted?----The left has made it the case that it is our moral duty to accept any and all refuge or immigrant who wants to come to the United States. We on average accept nearly a million immigrants into our country *every year*. We have many temporary immigrants on top of that who go to our schools, use our infrastructure, and work at our companies.What type of immigration requirements should we have? What factors in the United States should influence the numbers of immigrants and where they are coming from? Is there a problem with accepting too many of the "best and brightest" from other nations? So a large number of nations voted to condemn the United States for daring to recognize something the League of Nations put down into legal treaty that the United Nations was required to enforce.Many of our NATO allies openly voted against us.What are your thoughts on this? Some commentary from Europe is that they fear destabilization of the middle East with Iran building up tensions. Apparently taking a strong approach to unresolved issues is not the method Europe would take.Do you think Trump's foreign policy is a bull in a china shop? Or are we seeing resolution on conflicts dragged out for 70 years? Does strength and boldness matter? Or should we continue to appease in order to avoid war?Clearly my questions are biased. I understand there are libertarian conservatives that want a minimalist U.S. presence abroad. Feel free to state whether or not the UN and our NATO allies opinions matter and if Trump made a mistake that previous presidents had been avoiding. It's possible we will see Trump push for a massive infrastructure spending package in 2018. Big spending is never something conservatives like to see. But if we had to...----What infrastructure should the *federal government* be involved in?- Expansion/repair of highway system? Is it needed?- Mass transit?- Levees, hydrowater resources (with fresh water depleting)- Nuclear Power? Eventually energy prices will go back up again.- New networks such as vast fiber optic lines or wireless. (Addresses Net Neutrality whining).No an all inclusive list. Or would dumping states/local governments be the best method of "fixing" infrastructure? Or does that risk those entities being corrupt and sucking it up without anything to show for it?----This post assumes it's going to happen even if we don't want it to. If the spending was going to happen; where should it be going to in regards to infrastructure? nan nan The United States was never defined by geography. It was people who believed in certain principles and were sworn to that ideal. We are not defined by race, border, or religion. We are defined by a creed that spread aggressively in the 19th century via manifest destiny.At the end of ww2 the Japanese were convinced we would make them into additional states. After the reconstruction the people there were actually quite open to the idea. But we never did it.----Assuming the United States returned to the constitutional contraints that once existed. Is there any reason not to continue to add new states of areas that match our values and want to join?What standards should we impose? And if a country across the planet wants to join and meets tge requirements do we allow them due to distance?What does the United States mean to you? Are we just a geography? Does it mean anything anymore? nan nan nan nan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1mNMiS5kqkInteresting video about culture and its impact.- Early on the video Dinesh mentions that there has been a "black flight" that followed the "white flight" of the 70's. Where the black middle class has abandoned the "underclass" of poor blacks. He also points out that blacks perceive the federal government in a very different light than Americans typically do; due to owing much of their progress historically to federal government action. End of segregation, many government jobs, civil rights, etc. This sense of debt  tends to make them view the government a lot more favorably and can be a good reason why blacks typically don't align with conservatives.- Dinesh about half way through the video talks about two conflicts. A cab driver uses rational discrimination against a black youth to protect his cab and his life (with the knowledge of knowing that a black youth is much more likely to be violent/criminal). Then there is the law abiding black youth who is not treated fairly due to the color of his skin. Dinesh suggests the right of the cab driver supersedes the moral right of the black youth. Do you agree?- Dinesh makes the point that the black middle class and political class are greatly dependent on the very poor black communities due to affirmative action. Even though they come from good families and have good jobs; the fact that there is a incredibly poor community they can identify with continues to benefit them. If those communities were solved or made better they would suddenly find that the political power that benefits them would disappear over night.- Dinesh makes the point that the taboo nature, pc culture, and empowered the David Dukes of the country. If people cannot freely talk about race or the issues; they can make the claim that tens of millions of Americans feel like they do but are two scared to speak about it. The subject has become completely toxic; and no one is willing to address the issues for free of being called racists. Interesting side note we see that the cultural figures who have taken this on in recent times all have an "immunity" card. Ben Shapiro (Jews), Dinesh D'Souza (Indian), Milo (Gay). Essentially the only people who can loudly and publicly take on these issues are ones that have an immunity from the leftist attacks. Unfortunately Blacks already have a cultural term for undermining such intellectuals: Uncle Tom. Which is rather weird because Uncle Tom was a fictional character from a book that had a large impact on the abolitionist movement... It's almost as if they don't know their own history.- He lays out an interesting "remedy" which is ensure that government and government institutions are color blind; but allow the private sector to discriminate freely. His argument is that some of these groups cannot compete in a purely color blind society; as in they do not have the skill sets to succeed where historically these groups were successful due to their own discrimination practices. He mentions a Korean restaurant; where nearly all the employees are Korean. I think I diverge strongly from this. As I agree that *individual* discrimination is not as harmful as the left makes it out to be; *colluding* discrimination is incredibly harmful. He is on the right track while talking about the government; but he fails to realize the government is a problem due to the power it can have over peoples lives. Collusion, or organization, can be just as harmful to a people.----Interesting side note. Do we have a segregation that occurs between the poor and the middle class? Is this a bad thing? Does integration between these two groups help the poor to move up on the economic ladder? A subject that has deep rooted and damning impacts on the 20th century as well as the 21st century but is some how ignored in public discourse. Population Control. A concept found among Central Planning based ideologies. Both Fascism and Communism. But also among progressives here in the United States. Movement such as Eugenics (which was very strong in California among progressives) was built off of such a moral quandary as population running out of control. What are the fears?- Depletion of all the Earth's resources. More specifically resources that *we* currently depend upon. Be this water, air, oil, food, electricity, etc. - Increased war and disease. Populations more dense; more room for conflict.- Limited Wealth (tied to resources). Leftists believe that wealth is finite; thus the more people the more poor and worthless our lives will be.What political policies are currently driven based on Population Control?- Abortion. Not only do they want free and wide spread access to abortion they want to pay for free abortions internationally. - Climate Change. They have found a way to directly create a doomsday based on human activities; CO2. If they can crush economic growth they can crush population growth (though this is false; as the poorer a society the more children they typically have).There are other political agendas that can be tied to this. There is the Agenda 21 which has been dropped in congress and in the United Nations by leftists. The goal is to greatly slow down the growth of the human population; and eventually have birth rates so low across the planet that we will see the population start to shrink. Eventually have roughly 200 years they want to see the world population reduced to roughly 200 million people.----Now these fears are based out of the same fears central planners always have. They want to be in control and can't understand or grasp how to solve these "problems". We were supposed to be at peak oil decades ago. We were supposed to have mass famine and disease decades ago. None of these problems materialized.As conservatives should we give a fair review of population control? Their methods have been horrendous to life and liberty; and complete devaluing of human life. Even though they are anti-human in their approach to these issues; does that mean the issue shouldn't be considered? Do we let free markets determine how much population we can support? Will free markets react in time or will it lead to catastrophe as the left keeps predicting?We as humans are very bad at predicting the future; especially in regards to scientific advancement and human innovation. At the beginning of the 20th century horse manure was going to be a serious problem due to the amount generated in cities. All the great minds of the time were trying to figure out a way to deal with it. Then along came the automobile and what seemed like an insurmountable problem; was suddenly a non-issue.----What are your thoughts on population control? Is it just a misguided End justify the Means movement? The road to hell paved with good intentions? We can all imagine a point in which there are too many people. Is that point coming soon? Will that point never come due to market demands which will slow the growth of populations?How do we as conservatives confront this? Elites among the left fully 100% believe in this and have done so for decades. It's not something we can ignore.  Democrats like usual are dishonest in their portrayal of this subject. They often look for fringe anecdotal cases in order to provide cover for their over all argument.----What are conservative solutions to dreamers? Dreamers being defined as people who were brought here as children by their parents who have no/little association with their country origin (language or culture).Legally they are in the wrong; though it was not due to a decision made by them. Will their country of origin even accept them back if we attempted to deport them?This question will come to a head in the next 6 months. If conservatives are to relent on Dreamers; what should we get in return? What compromise would be sufficient for us to support passage of a amnesty for such a group of people? National id? Permanent increased funding for border security and expired visa response? Clearly we gave them amnesty in the 80's and they screwed us over. So we need to make certain that if we relent on this; that the problem is solved. nan What are your thoughts on his actions under the Obama era immigration platform (unconstitutional)? Did the Sheriff take things too far? Was he horrible and corrupt long before that time as leftists claim?----Please keep this discussion focused on the Sheriff; not on Trump or the recent pardon. Is tearing one down an aggression against a particular culture?Does the context matter of the monument?  Do the ideals behind it matter?If tearing down a monument is okay, what reasons could possibly justify it, and at what point do we stop?  Where does the line between historically significant  marker and white nationalist rally point start and stop?Some very general and open-ended questions - figured it might be good to hear some different opinions on this (don't feel any compulsion to answer any directly if you don't want, and feel free to weigh in on Charlottesville in particular if you want...) nan nan Open thread, talk about anything. Andrew Klavanhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHlOLikSe4AAt around 25 minutes Carrie Lukas a self-described libertarian works through questions of why women tend to "lean left". It seems as if she is suggesting that conservatives don't do well at personalizing why their pursuits are better for people and their families. So we can state: "Reduce taxes and regulations and we can see 5% GDP growth" which doesn't mean a whole lot to women. Meanwhile the Democrats can say "The reduced taxes will kill care to the elderly of your community and poor who cannot afford care and the reduce regulations will result in your children being poisoned".This seems to fall into the emotional/moral arguments that conservatives need to work on. It's not enough to have an effective policy; we need to emotionally tie it the people.----Are women more prone (on average) to emotional/moral arguments? Does this explain why more women vote Democrat than Republican? Klavan jokes that if women weren't given the right to vote Democrats wouldn't have had any power in the last 50 years. Is it an issue that this demographic is more likely to make decisions based on emotion? Or is this just a failure of conservatives to interact with this demographic better?I was helping my wife with her W-4 form for her new job and she was infuriated with how much money was being taken by taxes. At the same time she recently expressed opposition to the Republican healthcare plan because it was going to cut back on medicare/medicaid and she works with a lot of poor people who are in desperate need of care. Both of these are emotional responses. And when I expressed that the need to fund those programs requries higher taxes she responded with another emotional response of stating "Well if I'm paying for all of it; I might as well support single payer healthcare as I'm paying for anyways". I of course have to point out that taxes would have to go up significantly more to afford such a system; but the emotional responses for these issues are touchy. It also seems as if it is very easy to mislead people with emotional arguments.How do we best go about making the emotional/moral arguments? Lay out the facts and follow them up with a personalized narrative? Old discord server seems to have gone offline. New one:https://discord.gg/FPtcB32/u/Sordiax has offered to host it. It is now hot linked on the sidebar.---- https://discord.gg/Fs6bWdD/u/McDrMuffinMan and /u/Sordiax are admins for it. This is going to combine a few of the elements discussed on this board. And I know conservatives in general don't like to engage in these elements; but I ask that you put your creative faculties to work :).Emotional Arguments----People in general are influenced by emotional and moral arguments when they make their decisions. Conservatives like to think we're above that and fail to engage in that arena allowing our opposition to have dominance among that demographic of the population. Emotional/moral arguments (unless they are genius) need to be tailored to the groups in which we are trying to *persuade* to our way of thinking. Reagan's "Shining City on the Hill" was a genius emotional argument that forms an ideal and imagery that sucks this demographic into his cause.My wife who has typically identified as an objectivists (due to her love of Ayn Rand) often succumbs to emotional arguments even though objectivists should theoretically be a group least prone to them. She works as a Nurse and often helps out with rural health; as such she is impacted by the notion that if the new Healthcare Bill passes medicare/aid spending will go down and she see's that as a direct impact on the poor people she serves. Logically she knows the ACA was horrible for the hospital system and has turned many nurses into glorified secretaries (doing paperwork all day) but at the same time she sees very ill people that rarely see doctors who might die if they do not continue to get as much funding. When I attempted arguments of the nature of "the government does not have the money" or "the ACA is driving costs through the roof greatly impacting this demographic and others" they appear to fall on deaf ears.The Future and The Past----I recently dropped a "semi-conclusion" that intellectuals lean left due to the fact that their fields are rooted in a form of "progress". They can look at the history of their field and see where they started and where they are now and see that they are in a much better position. They apply that same *emotional* mental framework to government and are looking to see "progress". Thus they are upset when Congress is in a deadlock; as they see that as failing to progress the country "forward". Note that they have a notion of what forward is; and we need to understand why they have that notion.The idea I had is that conservatives lack that "shining city on the hill" future in which to progress towards. We need to have an emotional framework that shows that we are working towards a future; not just reverting things to how they were in the past. Why this is important is that the past has a lot of negative connotations associated with it. This is why the left is so thoroughly anti-American. From a political stand point the more they can make the population at large be disgusting with the past; the more it makes it hard for conservatives to win the culture war and political battles that follow.To be honest there are lot of bad things that have happened in our history. And it is very easy for the left to associate those bad things with the systems we as conservatives propose (emotional arguments). So any argument that states "I want things to be how they used to be in regards to x" can easily be quote cropped to "I want things to be how they used to be". The left can effectively pulled up horrible occurrence of racial disparity, worker rights, wealth inequality, etc and claim that you just want the country to be just like that. You propose empowering the states via State's Rights? They point to the confederate States (even though the North also used it's state based powers to nullify slavery within their borders).At the same time the left is rooted in policies that have been around since the 19th century. But they have created the impression that what they are doing is new and is "progress". They are not "rooted" in any past; as conservatives naturally are. But they should be. Conservatives attempt to call them socialists in an effort to tie them to that. The reality is progressives are more akin to Fascists than Socialists. The Assignment----Your mission if you choose to accept it :):What is an "ideal society" that projects into the future something that represents conservative principles and philosophy? A narrative in which to work *towards* that creates the *emotional* sense that we are "progressing" "forward". This vision should have a series of "Goals" towards that end.The founding fathers looked back before they looked forward. Many elements of the nations founding were based on principles found throughout Europe and there are a lot of parallels to the Roman Republic/Empire.----Based on the few posts I have seen. I doubt conservatives will have identical visions; so it's probably a good idea that we take this mental exercise to see what it looks like. Three days late bitches.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9Pj8gqaQVEAt about 9 minutes into the video Andrew covers how easy it is to make an unsubstantiated statement and have people believe it. People would rather accept a premise that fits their narrative than they would demand that any speculative comment/statement be proven. It is often much harder to prove a negative if not impossible compared to making the claim in the first place. This is why conspiracy theories never go away. This is why Trump collusion with Russia will never go away. They have no evidence of anything of the sort; but they assert that they do. There is no discourse and those making the claim have no need/basis in our society to actually provide evidence for their absurd claim before making it.What should be the approach in general (without sounding like a concern troll) to ensure that people making claims back them up? How do we define what is common knowledge vs. speculation? Is seems like a sad state of our political discourse that conspiracy theories are actually main stream politics.At about 24 minutes he has James O'Keefe on and interestingly he restates some of the comments I have made in the past about the media. The republicans are deadly afraid of the media and its ability for controlling the narrative. He feels the general control the media has over voters and the population at large has greatly declined; but the GOP continues to let themselves be controlled by these organizations.He follows on that the media is invested in their narrative on the Russian collusion story. They will ride the ship down if they have to. I have made a comment recently on /r/conservative but the media is not the "news". Which is why they are considered "Fake News" (Shapiro disagrees with this). It isn't that they don't report real facts on occasion; it's that they don't actually report the news. What does that mean? The News reports on the facts to the people. The media reports on their narrative to the people whether or not the facts support it. Shapiro seems to think that we should lend them credibility because they occasionally report on some facts. The problem is that they are a propaganda outlet for Democratic narratives where occasionally they will incorporate the facts into their coverage. While can admit to any facts brought up you are under no obligation to accept them as a news source.At 30 minutes roughly he talks about the so called "editing" myth the left uses to try and debunk his Project Veritas videos. As anyone with a brain knows; all media has to edit the source to fit within a consumable story. This nefarious use of "edit" or the eventual nefarious use of "doctored" is a deflection tactic to hide the ugly underbelly of the left and the organizations that support them.----Is this just a matter of following the ratings? People in general would rather hear a narrative than the news? Would it be more beneficial if these outlets stop pretending as if they were the news? Where is the disconnect? Highly intelligent people can get it wrong; and history is listed with them. But what is causing intelligent people to support unintelligent positions? How do we have a bastion of knowledge such as Boston that leans heavily liberal? Insanely elite, trust fund money out the ass, and a very high quotient of education. When you get such concentrations of intelligence you would expect well intelligent conclusions to rise to the surface.----Educated does not mean intelligent. That's a good explanation for a large portion of academia and the number of PhDs that prescribe to leftist philosophy. But truly intelligent and educated people can fall on that side of the spectrum. What is causing this? Some claim Cultural Marxism and indoctrination through schools. I'm sure in part that does occur. But does that explain all of them?Is intelligence being used loosely here? There are many forms of intelligence and even many forms of education. Often enough a very educated person is so specialized in knowledge that they lose sight of basic principles outside of their field of expertise. So we could have a person who is very intelligent on mathematical principles and applications; but doesn't have the faintness clue about human behavior (Sheldon from Big Bang theory?) Or someone who might have the intellectual capability of understanding human behavior who has crammed through head so full of their specialty that they are not really educated on other areas so they make uninformed opinions.Assuming the above is true. Are intelligent people just as likely to make uninformed opinions? There is a matter of human nature for people to always have an opinion on a subject even if they know very little about it. Once you formulate an opinion; you have a stake in said opinion. People in general tend not to want to be wrong (whether smart or dumb). This is even more so a problem among people with large Egos. So an intelligent person can be biased into holding an opinion and due to Ego stand by that opinion and defend it?Is this all a matter of Ego? Or is there a truly warped sense of values? People not knowing their own values (as I've discussed on here before) and being able to apply them accordingly. ----What are your thoughts on intelligent people supporting ill conceived notions of government from leftist ideology? We saw many intelligent/educated people support Eugenics around the globe and the Nazis propaganda machine in Germany.This post isn't necessarily about the "Intellectual Backers" of the leftist ideologies. As those individuals are specialized in political pursuits and are intentionally nefarious in how they go about this. This is about intelligent people who ended up being "useful idiots" for the leftist cause. Short post. But most people just call the celebration by the date: "Happy 4th!" Does it even fill appropriate to celebrate independence after this amount of time. No one seems to care about the revolutionary war anymore.Would it be more appropriate to have a foundation day or Constitution Day instead? The birth of a nation? Independence day sort of celebrates this; but clearly there was a large gap between the Declaration of Independence and the drafting of the Constitution.  Prager University video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8RA1e88BWsI have railed on this in the past; and it has to do with the inherent bigotry of the left. This video touches up on it; but doesn't fully address the issue. They blame appeals to transparency instead of the reason why such transparency is a problem. Say I donate to a political cause; people are aware of it and understand who stands behind it. Seems legitimate in a honest and tolerant society. The left are not tolerant; they are bigots who cannot abide people who have a different opinion and seek to destroy them. They are not okay with disagreeing or battling within the realm of ideas; their opposition must be destroyed, their livelihood lost, and they must be humiliated and shunned.The video links this to the Civil Rights of 1964 which is spot on. The reason those bills were necessary (though Constitutionally questionable) is bigotry as a form of collusion in order to destroy the targets of said bigotry. Individual acts of bigotry were not the problem; it was an orchestrated campaign of bigotry between government and hosts of individuals to hurts and destroy the targets of their hate.The unions want this knowledge to hurt those who go against them. This is why Unions want votes to be public knowledge so they can punish union members who dared vote against their party line.Mozilla CEO Brendan Eich was forced out of the company due to making a private donation that Democrats in the government leaked. The bigots came after him and harassed him and his company until they fired him. He did not use his power within Mozilla to make a political statement, he didn't even talk to the press as an employee at any point and make a statement on the issue. He *dared* to have opinion that contradicted the left and he needed to pay for it.Some conservatives call this a "free market" and allow this type of bigotry to run amok. This isn't individuals making decisions; this is a colluded effort. A bar tender refusing to serve gays is a single act of bigotry. A bar tender working with an organized group of bar tenders to ensure gays can't drink at bars is where this becomes a problem and the 1964 Civil Rights act was necessary.----Is the video correct in telling people to avoid the appeal of "transparency" as while it sounds nice it ultimately leads to evil activities? Or are they off mark and are focusing on the symptom of the problem: Leftist bigotry? And if the ladder; what can be done about it? When we pursue policy are we approaching it from the perspective of the individual or the community? Is a collective a real thing or a manufactured entity? Is there a difference between a community and a collective?I would say that a community is made up of individuals; where a collective assumes a standard among them. What would be a collective need? The military? Defense being a collective need? Is a collective a community of communities? Does that mean the individual is less representative at such a level?As conservatives it seems as if we value the individual much more so than the left. But on both sides of the spectrum the community is mostly ignored or lost. Are the culture problems we face as a nation based in this loss of community? Are cities inherently opposed to a community due to their size and high density population?To you what do you value from each of the elements above? How do we rebuild the community aspect of our society? Or should we? Is the individual vs. the collective a false debate? anyone with info on this? What are your thoughts on Puerto Rico finally becoming a state. Large numbers of them serve in our armed forces, they receive welfare from the federal government, and many of them come to the U.S. to work. I personally have always thought we should make them a state but there are obvious draw backs to it.1. Will be a Democratic stronghold. Low taxes and high welfare is the wet dream of leftists of getting people dependent and that has been the environment there for decades.2. Weak economy. Though this may improve if they become a state...----If you are against Statehood for them what would be a compromise that you would be willing to accept on the issue? Merging two blue states to shrink their Senate votes? Creating the State of Jefferson out of Northern California and Southern Oregon which is very conservative?The merging of two blue states will never happen though Rhode Island shouldn't be it's own state... This is based off of earlier posts I have made about the left and their eagerness to be the arbiters of the truth/facts. It first starts off with them using post modern arguments of no objective truth/morality and that any perspective is equally correct. After they have created this uncertainty they move in to positions where they can perceive to have authority over subjects and dictate to the masses their "truth". They ignore the philosophical and moral standards in which made those institutions great in the first place and run them into the ground in their political crusade.----Examples:- Science - More specifically climate science; though it is found else where. Institution based on a process of being skeptical and of understanding the various aspects of our world/universe. You had NASA spending large portions of its budget doing the job of the NOAA. You had the director of NASA under Obama claiming that it was a top priority for his organization to teach Muslims that they have a rich history in science/mathematics. Areas that are not scientific; but are pushed as such from trusted organizations. The left embeds itself within these institutions, within academic, within editorial boards for prestigious journals and they work to push a narrative. Is this collusion or just a natural byproduct of the left's ideology? Is this more prevalent now due to the internet and the ability to network/collude much easier before email/forums/chat rooms. - Court of Law - Institution that exist to apply the rule of law perverted/corrupted into philosopher kings that can push their political agenda. A *nonpolitical branch* made political by the left because they could see themselves as arbiters of truth/facts even though their positions were not. They don't want to be told that what they perceive as "right" is not a constitutionally mandated position. They want no disagree and those who disagree must be squelched. - Academia - Perfect place for them to corrupt as it allow them to seed their terrible failed ideas into impressionable minds that don't know any better. A place where they can dictate "facts" and cannot be contradict nor can they be fired due to tenure for such unethical behavior. - Journalism - A place for them to inform public opinion and form national narratives on events/people. Always biased; but now a collusion with a specifically political purpose.----All of the above institutions have a perceived objective integrity that was once held as absolute and necessary. Is this a failure of our culture that these institutions reflect or is this intentional perversion/corruption by the left so that they can dictate their nonsense as facts?Is there a power to all the above institutions? And is it that power that breeds corruption? How do we diversify that power and provide checks and balances upon it? Or should we? nan nan nan nan I usually one to favor Trump on issues like this, but I'm fairly certain that the wiretap didn't happen. I don't think Trump is perpetuating it out of malevolence, I just think that he made a mistake, and now he is in damage control, he does want to admit he lied, either because he wants to keep his approval ratings, because he wants to preserve his ego, or because he thinks he did wring and does not want to deal with that burden.I think this happened because Trump hasn't been in politics before, and this means he doesn't know what he is doing. This would mean that Trump is acting out of ignorance, not malevolence. Trump is beginning to realize that getting support from the people he works with is not easy. There is a possibility that most of Trump's failures are not out of him being unwilling, or worse yet being of malevolent intent, but because he simply doesn't know how to police his rhetoric.What helps Trump within his support base, is hurting him outside of it. Basically, the problem is that Trump being vocal and unpoliced makes his base happy, this happens because his base was, and still is tired of the uncensoredness, not to mention that his more hardcore followers are already solidified in. At the same time, when Trump messes up, people who support him to a lesser extent, like many people on this subreddit, are turned off, and all it gives is the Mainstream media more ammo to solidify their base, and even gain some.Trump does not know how to behave as president. I am not going to ascribe motive becuse presently I have no evidence to back up any statemeny. I will state my opinion, and that is that Trump is doing this because of he is partially unwilling to learn the rules, as that will sacrifice his base, but also is to ego based to retract his statements.The simple and unlikely solution to this is for Trump to apologize for wrongdoing, and what I would give to be able to make him, much let alone help him do that.Trump is still early in hsi presidency and who knows what may occur, maybe he will turn out to be the best president ever. Maybe he will suck to high heaven. Whether or not there can be a consensus on this is reliant on Trump to behave like a president. He may, either accidentally or on purpose, needs to behave more presidential, at least to the extent that he will verify information that he sees prior to tweeting about it. Trump can't just take something down once its on twitter, its going to backfire due to the amount of people against him.Trump, you have need to control your behavior. At least start by making sure what you see is backed up by evidence, I know you can do better than this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDYpRhoZqBYFull length movie produced by HBO some years back that is fairly accurate on a lot of issues within DoD Acquisition. The movie has a political bias to it, and the ending had some falsehoods that were further pushing that narrative.It covers the Bradley and how many problems were introduced to the defense program and the issues that arose from it. All the characters are based off of real people and this was a real incident, though many things were dramatized for entertainment purposes.----Do you think the the General pushing the Bradley was necessarily bad for supporting the program (ignoring the subversive tactics he used)?Were you aware or do you even care that defense acquisition programs generally take a decade or more to get off the ground? Meaning fielding weapons and systems for future threats is neither easy nor something we can be reactive on?Do you think the government's mandates (by law) of LFT&E (Live Fire Test and Evaluation) activities from the 1980's (and further refined over the years) will help to avert future Bradley's or M16's from entering service and costing American lives?Movie was generally good over all and gives some insight on DoD problems. It also shows how Ego can easily drive projects that appear to be scientifically driven (Climate Change debate). nan It is important to know some of the opposing ideology acts, and what we need to do to counteract it. The following is an except from "Rules for Radicals" on tactics:----1. "Power is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have."2. "Never go outside the expertise of your people. When an action or tactic is outside the experience of the people, the result is confusion, fear and retreat.... [and] the collapse of communication.3. "Whenever possible, **go outside the expertise of the enemy**. Look for ways to increase insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty. (This happens all the time. Watch how many organizations under attack are blind-sided by seemingly irrelevant arguments that they are then forced to address.)4. "**Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules**. You can kill them with this, for they can no more obey their own rules than the Christian church can live up to Christianity."5. "**Ridicule is man's most potent weapon**. It is almost impossible to counteract ridicule. Also it infuriates the opposition, which then reacts to your advantage."6. "A good tactic is one your people enjoy."7. "A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag. Man can sustain militant interest in any issue for only a limited time...."8. "**Keep the pressure on, with different tactics and actions**, and utilize all events of the period for your purpose."9. "**The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself**."10. "The major premise for tactics is the development of operations that will **maintain a constant pressure upon the opposition**. It is this unceasing pressure that results in the reactions from the opposition that are essential for the success of the campaign."11. "If you push a negative hard and deep enough, it will break through into its counterside... every positive has its negative."12. "The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative."13. Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.  In conflict tactics there are certain rules that [should be regarded] as universalities. One is that the opposition must be singled out as the target and 'frozen.'...     "...any target can always say, 'Why do you center on me when there are others to blame as well?' When your 'freeze the target,' you disregard these [rational but distracting] arguments.... Then, as you zero in and freeze your target and carry out your attack, all the 'others' come out of the woodwork very soon. They become visible by their support of the target...'     "One acts decisively only in the conviction that all the angels are on one side and all the devils on the other." (pps.127-134)----I bolded some of the tactics that have been very relevant in the modern culture war. For instance number 5 was the weapon of choice for Jon Stewart on the Daily Show, who was highly successful at manipulating millions of young people to think a certain way. It wasn't just "ridicule" as this states; it was *dishonest ridicule*. What can we do as conservatives to lock down some of these tactics so they are not effective? Are any of these tactics just being smart and something we should adopt ourselves?

I previously talked about the "swiftboat" tactics; do we think they will use their tried and true methods or will they find a different angle?They don't seem to be moderating and it would be nice to predict their angle of attack against Conservatives. Obviously they will attack Trump every second of every day; but people will likely go tone deaf to the screaming. Will they attempt to do what they did to Milo? Get conservatives to turn against each other? I don't care for Milo that much; but he has done a good job of trolling the left.Love or Hate Trump, he has done a good job of neutering the media. We've needed to take the attack to the media for years. All my posts following the 2012 election were about controlling the narrative and finding a way to defeat the media on this front. Will the media re-establish it's dominance of the narrative and will that be the vehicle in which they will assault us?Shapiro on the media getting attacked.http://www.dailywire.com/podcasts/13647/ep-256-what-do-conservatives-stand-ben-shapiro# nan nan The president is saying that millions of illegal immigrants voted for Hillary Clinton. I can't find anything to support that notion and certainly not that number. He won the election but he's still contesting the results. Can anyone explain the reasoning behind this? Is he just playing the media for some other purpose? nan nan nan What do you think is the proper balance between the above two? Are small gains better than staying 100% true to your principles? Can you accept a minor evil to achieve a greater good? Kevin Williamson wrote a great article in National Review about the cult of American presidency, loss of republicanism, and transition of Americans from being citizens to being subjects. Here is the full article:http://www.nationalreview.com/article/443402/barack-obama-presidency-cult-worrisome-trendThe part with which I agree most is the following:>The idea that a large, complex society enjoying English liberty could long endure without the guiding hand of a priest-king was, in 1776, radical. A few decades later, it became ordinary ‚Äî Americans could not imagine living any other way. The republican manner of American presidents was pronounced: There is a famous story about President Lincoln‚Äôs supposedly receiving a European ambassador who was shocked to see him shining his own shoes. The diplomat said that in Europe, a man of Lincoln‚Äôs stature would never shine his own shoes. ‚ÄúWhose shoes would he shine?‚Äù Lincoln asked.>As American society grows less literate and the state of its moral education declines, the American people grow less able to engage their government as intellectually and morally prepared citizens. We are in the process ‚Äî late in the process, I‚Äôm afraid ‚Äî of reverting from citizens to subjects. Subjects are led by their emotions, mainly terror and greed. They need not be intellectually or morally engaged ‚Äî their attitude toward government is a lot like that of Trump‚Äôs old pal Roy Cohn: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me what the law is. Tell me who the judge is.‚ÄùMeanwhile, Chris Ladd at Chron offered a different take back in August 2015, with which I agree as well. His argument is that we are treating politics and government as merely another business of which we are consumers. Here is his article:http://blog.chron.com/goplifer/2015/08/trump-and-sanders-offer-consumer-politics/He hits the nail on the head, in my opinion, with the following:>Listen closely as enthusiasts describe the appeal of Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump and a disturbing pattern emerges. You won‚Äôt hear much about policy proposals...>What you will hear are complaints. Other candidates ‚Äúaren‚Äôt listening.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe system‚Äù is dominated by money. My candidate is the only one with the courage to tell the truth...Deconstruct comments from the two candidates‚Äô supporters and they all revolve around the same core of abstract grievances.>Both candidates are offering voters a chance to address a single, pressing grievance ‚Äì our political system is failing to respond to my needs. Forget the policy platforms, or lack of one, both candidates are offering a political program that replaces the citizen with the consumer.**What are your opinions? Do you agree with Kevin, Chris, or both? Are we reverting to becoming subjects? Are we reaching the age of consumer politics? Feel free to discuss.** nan nan nan nan nan So, suffice it to say I wasted a ton of time on a political question/debate sub last night. https://np.reddit.com/r/askableedingheart/comments/5f8o33/how_is_wanting_to_keep_what_you_earn_greed_but/ I'm a little perturbed at some of the perspectives on there regarding income tax and "earning".  A common theme seemed to be that no one can really earn anything fully because:1) uncertainty exists in outcome and initial conditions2) there are some shared Commons that everyone takes advantage of.  Namely, things like not being shanked by one's neighbor in a state of chaotic Hobbsian human nature is one such boon of the state.The point I've tried to make was namely that no, the government doesn't own the fruit of my labor in any sense: moral, legal, otherwise.  Even though I have obtained part of it under the umbrella of a pretty cool society made possible by the best government ever conceived, I don't owe anything to the state a priori.  An example I gave was three guys haggling on their own land over a chicken. The government isn't entitled to a fractional chicken: I own that.  We can abolish the chicken tax, and there is no moral quandary, because I own the chicken and I decide how to fund the government.I suppose there are some broader topics here. Does the state actually "own" anything?  Should there be any movement on the notion that the percentage by which one pays taxes ought to scale with the percentage by which one profits from the Commons and/or boons of the state?  Does it make sense, for example, to tax Internet commerce at a higher rate because it occurs on something developed by government funds?Edit: updated link Check it out.  Our Illustrious Orange One [has issued a brief statement about his upcoming policy priorities.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xX_KaStFT8)  I'm disturbed by the fact that he and his people have a "list of executive actions" they want to roll out right away, which smacks of overly-active executive government, but we shall see.  I was also bugged by some of the things he didn't include, like say, the prospect of defunding certain superfluous government-funded organizations.   However I was quite pleased at the idea of freeing up domestic energy/fuel production.  What do you guys think? nan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7lpN3EhXoLike many of the videos I post, these are a bit old. This was an event where the President of CSU (California State University, not University of California) LA decided he would cancel Shapiro's speech until they could have a more "diverse" panel to speak on the issue of diversity. The president attempted to do this without actually scheduling the new event which essentially meant he was squelching the opinion of someone he disagreed with. The video starts off with Ben being very much angry.----Some observations (as I'm prone to do, feel free to comment on any of these or about the video itself):- The left (a professor) projects onto yaf and Shapiro as being racist and "Fascists". Meanwhile the professor threatens violence, actively move to strip down posters for this free speech event, harasses individuals interested in visiting this event to the point that they can't even use the front doors to enter the venue. True ideological fascists in the works, yet they immediately project it onto the target of their hate. Pure bigotry.- The left claims they want tolerance? It is clear that they don't based on what happened at this event. But perhaps "tolerance" is a dog whistle for something else? Tolerance in the way they use it means, "your judgment on values is no longer valid and is hateful and not acceptable". A word taken over by the left, "tolerance", again misused and conservatives have allowed them to co-opt the word.- Three forms of diversity and my opinions of Shapiro's initial break down: 1.) Diversity of ethnicity 2.) Diversity of thought (view point) 3.) Diversity of values. The first being nearly irrelevant, yet is the hallmark of diversity that the left has pushed. The second is important for civil discourse and to learn, probably the most important diversity to promote within a free thinking society (yet the left hates this and attacks it). The third form of diversity is the most damaging to society and needs to be avoided at all costs (yet has been actively been pursued by cultural Marxists and the left). People who live together within a nation who fail to share values because you injected a diversity of values are fundamentally going to clash and never agree.- Martin Luther King Jr. lost, and Malcolm X won. Never thought of it that way. I don't think this is necessarily true until Obama. Obama has empowered the race baiters who were complete jokes in the late 90's and early 2000's and made them relevant.- Racial diversity is a proven hypocritical position by the leftist institutions. Shapiro shows that CSU LA has a disproportionate amount of women, Asians, and pacific islanders based on the demographics of LA. We see this hypocrisy on the "wage gap" myth and the "justice system is racist" myth. Ben has mentioned elsewhere that hypocrisy arguments are not good arguments as people change over time and based on circumstances. I would argue these hypocrisy cases are happening at the exact time and subject. They choose to ignore these facts that contradict them because it doesn't support their agenda (End's justify the means).- **Arbitrary groupings a hallmark of the left**? I come across this problem when dealing with leftists on abortion. They formulate a group on some arbitrary nature, skin color, sexual orientation, gender, mental illness, whatever. They use that arbitrary grouping to make their argument seem more legitimate. "Well it's not a person". What is a person? It's what they "feel" it should be. They don't care what science has to say, or consistency because that defeats their argument. I think this is a subject that we as conservatives need to delve into more deeply. This definitely falls into the "controlling the narrative/language" discussion. But this maybe the root of all leftist logical fallacies.- Diversity of values is just plain wrong and dumb. Some values are better than others. That doesn't mean we shouldn't evaluate our values from time to time to see if they could be better. What it means is the values from 3rd world medieval equivalent Muslim nations are not equal to our system of values and are in fundamental conflict with our perceptions of liberty. Again advocated by the left.- Ben makes the point that the left wants to abolish **responsibility** (individual). This seems like a direct path to collectivism. A value oriented society is centered around individual liberty and responsibility. If they can use moral relativism and "diversity of values" they can destroy the core of this nation. This is probably another topic worthy of discussion among conservatives.- Diversity of point of view seems to be the only diversity the left actively tries to squelch. And you see it in the form of their bigoted targeting of the Mozilla CEO because he dared to have a different view on the definition of marriage. You see it in this video. It's harassment, it's nasty, and it's evil. And it's KKK level bigotry. Supposedly all those evil people came over to the Republican party (projection) yet they are still using the same tactics that they used from the beginning.- In the Q&A he brings up the misuse of "rights" by the left. "Positive" rights are things you can demand from others and force them to do for you. Essentially not a right, but a form of tyranny/slavery (the opposite of what a right is). I've seen this misuse of language elsewhere: Social Justice. They add a word in front of a term that completely contradicts the second word, yet they act as if it has as much legitimacy. State Capitalism. An oxymoron, they can use to deflect failed socialist states and pretend as if it was another form of Capitalism (different intent from the other misuses).----Interesting points brought up on diversity. Thoughts? The more I look into this the more nefarious the left seems on a whole host of subjects. Whoever the intellectual backing is of the left is in no better terms evil. ["With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation‚Äôs wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan‚Äîto do all which may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations."](https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=mal&amp;amp;fileName=mal3/436/4361300/malpage.db&amp;amp;recNum=0)As a graybeard millennial, I don't have the anecdotal experience to back up the following claim, but I still think it's accurate:This is the most divisive campaign in living memory!Not only is right fighting left, republican against democrat, but we have brother fighting g brother: the split of the conservative right is nearly complete. A similar, though not as extensive, split can be found in the liberal left.There are proTrumpers and NeverTrumpers, PrincipleOverParty and AnyoneButHer. Regardless of how you vote, the next week will bring a close to the campaign season.But can it bring a close to the divide in our Republic?  The country has seen great division before, whether it be the claims of a hermaphroditic claims against Adams or the warning that 'your young daughters will all be raped' against Jefferson; be it the blue coats or the grey coats; we've seen division before.So the question, the call for debate: Can we heal as a nation? If not, why not? If so, how do we bring this healing wind about?What action do we, as conservatives, do to restore unity and peace to our country?Does the method change depending on who next week's winner is? Why? How?  (This conversation is also available on my website, [www.BrokenDad.com](https://jaredlanny.wordpress.com/2016/11/03/reconciliation-reparations-and-seeing-each-other-as-people-again/) ) Here's an article from the Foundation of Economic Education about the new overtime rules that will take effect in a month.https://fee.org/articles/new-overtime-rule-threatens-the-side-hustle/4 years ago, when I was between college and medical school, this was a law I absolutely despised. I was working at a clinic as a Medical Assistant, trying to build my CV so medical schools would find me an experienced and capable applicant.The more time I spent evaluating X-rays, administering treatments, and interviewing patients, the more of a leg up I got on my competition. Medical schools have notoriously low acceptance rates, around 1% for out-of-state applicants, and I needed every opportunity to show I was different.Additionally, while my parents were doing everything they could to help me, they were falling into difficult times. My father had a small business in a market that had just crashed. All the money I earned would go towards living expenses and traveling across the US to interview.I told my employer this and explained that I'd work 60 hours per week if she'd let me. Even better was that she wanted to hire me that often as well. I remember when she was filling out the schedule for the month, she had me in for 3 days of the week and a Saturday - 36 hours. She needed someone to fill in for another day of the week and Sunday. I volunteered. But, she couldn't fill me in for those slots because she would have to pay me 50% more for "overtime."I understood that she was a small business owner who was barely keeping afloat. She had cut costs in the past by firing half of her staff and picking up the work her secretaries and techs did herself. It increased her workload, but it was necessary.I was absolutely livid. I wanted to work at the same wage and get the extra hours and pay. She wanted to hire me at the same wage for the extra hours. But, the government made it illegal for us to engage in this mutually beneficial agreement.Further, I was livid that the government dictated that working more than 40 hours per week was overtime. Just because others view 40 hours a full-time work week doesn't mean I have to subscribe to that notion. I believed, and continue to believe, that 60 hours a week for me, is normal. I enjoy my work and I enjoy the money I earned and will earn for it.This governmental policy legislated money I could use for interviews away from me. I tried to pick up part-time work for another employer, but my schedule for my "full-time" job changed every week. This was inconvenient to the prospective clinic I'd work part-time, and the owner decided not to hire me. I can't say I blame him.As a result, I had to turn down about a third of the interviews I received. It is unheard of to do this because receiving acceptance to medical school is such a blessing and the acceptance rate *after* interview is ~50%. Thank God I eventually got into a medical school, but I will never forget this execrable policy, its impact on my own life, and the impact it will have on other millenials who are just starting their careers, eager to earn a living for themselves and the families they're just starting to create. nan nan The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote. The electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures.When vacancies happen in the representation of any State in the Senate, the executive authority of such State shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies: Provided, That the legislature of any State may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct...This Amendment changes the election of Senators from State Legislators choosing, to a popular vote, the same as the house of representatives.Supporters of the repeal say that Senators no longer take the states needs into account. My question then becomes, aren't the people the states? I, being from Utah, have different needs than guy Joe from Massachusetts, but similar to my neighbor down the street. so my senators represent me and my neighbor and by extension my state. Am I missing something?  Over the past year or so, I've seen a shocking number of conservatives rally against free trade. I don't mean the conservatives who point out that trade deals aren't free trade and wish we had sincerely free trade. I take issue with the ones who argue that a trade deficit means that we're losing, or that tariffs are an economic priority because free trade is a net loss.The mentality belies a deep level of misunderstanding of economics or a more sinister desire to garner votes the way Democrats do - that is, by concentrating the benefit, in this case among people who are laid off for a multitude of reasons including competitive, efficient production abroad, and dispersing the cost among the rest of the citizenry.Benjamin Powell is one of my favorite modern-day economists and he addresses the multiple fallacies that have popped up this election cycle head-on. Here's the article in which he does so:https://fee.org/articles/no-free-trade-does-not-hurt-the-economy/I've had long arguments with people over whether or not free trade is a net gain or loss, and even if we discount the immorality of trade barriers and discuss only their effectiveness, the best argument I've heard against free trade goes something like this:"Yes, in a free market when people are laid off, labor resources (people) are freed up to move from non-competitive industries to competitive ones, thereby increasing productivity and benefiting consumers. However, with the system we have, when an American is laid off because American consumers choose to buy cheaper foreign goods, the laid off worker goes on unemployment benefits, i.e. welfare. This is a strain on all Americans through taxation, so as long as the Welfare State exists, protectionism must be instituted."While this didn't pass the smell test to me, I respected the fact that there was an internal consistency to this line of reasoning, so I decided to look up the number of people who have applied for unemployment benefits over the years, as well as the percentage of applicants who are accepted for them.Here is the chart for 4-week averages of jobless claims since the late 1960s:https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IC4WSANote here that the most recent peak was after the recession, which makes sense, but if free trade were so detrimental, then it should be higher than other peaks before the passage of NAFTA and other deals that have moved us towards freer trade.Instead, the peak is the same as the one after the late 70s/early 80s recession when the [trade deficit was $69 billion](http://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/28/business/1983-trade-deficit-hit-69.4-billion.html), despite the fact that [2008's trade deficit was $696 billion and 2009's trade deficit was $381 billion](https://www.epi.org/publication/international_picture_20100211/). Similarly, the lowest trough of unemployment claims came in 2000, nearly identical to the trough in 1988 before the passage of NAFTA.Here is the chart for US unemployment insurance (UI) recipiency rate:http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/03/13/1370628/-Percentage-of-out-of-work-Americans-receiving-unemployment-compensation-now-a-paltry-23-1Keep in mind that the percentage of unemployed who receive welfare is a policy dictated at the state level. So, as long as conservatives are winning at the state-level, that welfare program and incentive to stay out of work and on welfare is greatly diminished. The 20 states with the lowest UI recipiency rate are as follows: SC, SD, LA, FL, GA, AZ, TN, NC, VA, OK, IN, MS, AL, UT, MO, NE, TX, NH, KY, OH ([Source = Figure C](http://www.epi.org/publication/how-low-can-we-go-state-unemployment-insurance-programs-exclude-record-numbers-of-jobless-workers/)). Nearly all of them are Republican states.As seen from the above charts, it turns out that both of these numbers are rather cyclical. They have no relation to NAFTA and other attempts to free up trade between American consumers and cheap producers abroad, nor have they increased in recent years when politicians have decided to gin up feelings of resentment.Myth. Hopefully. Debunked. Title says it all. How do we turn states like California conservative? It once voted Republican, and it still has large numbers of conservatives in the state (myself included). But what needs to happen to win the culture war?It doesn't seem like Republicans or conservatives have a plan for this. We do have juggernauts like Ben Shapiro who live in LA fighting for our cause. But it doesn't seem to make a difference. nan nan [Twitter in deep](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-former-twitter-employees-and-saudi-national-charged-acting-illegal-agents-saudi-arabia) nan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMz9xpPQlTk 1791 video analyzing the appeal of AOC and Trump, and how both have a loose hold on the facts yet are very popular with their base. He follows that their arguments are an appeal to emotions, that speaks on an moral/emotional appeal to their supporters and that the little details were irrelevant to that type of discussion.I would argue Obama‚Äôs entire 2008 campaign was based on this. AOC did not invent this, and neither did Obama. It is populism. If you listen to a single Bernie Sanders speech (it is incredibly painful) you will find few actual facts, yet it is loaded with buzzwords and emotional language. He appeals to the morals of the people ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not right‚Äù as he completely lies his ass off on each subject. I remember listening to one of his speeches late in the 2016 primary and thought I was listening to the ramblings of a mad man. Yet the democratic/young people crowd cheered widly as if what he was saying made actual sense.People want someone to stand up on the stage and project their moral indignation. Why did Trump seem like a fighter and more able to handle the problems of D.C? Because he expressed the moral and emotional outrage of large segments of the country. All the people who were pushed out of manufacturing due to globalism who were left to ‚Äúlearn how to code‚Äù were pissed as they saw their way of life and culture destroyed by the coastal states. But even more than that, people who are upset need someone or something to blame. Having a political leader stand up there and put voice to your anger and give it a target can have a strong impact.Conservatives up until Trump have failed to engage on this level, which is often why they fail to reach any sustainable numbers with certain demographics (young people). I have made the argument previously on this subreddit that conservatives need to learn to be able to play on multiple levels. Have a philosophy and policy structure that is based on sound evidence and rationale. Be willing to talk on the moral and emotional level of the topic. It is not enough to show that high taxes lead to poor outcomes, you need to show the moral decay of stealing from others or lack of work ethic or responsibility. These need to be hammered home.But not only that, (and this is where my argument becomes borderline Tribal Politics, which I abhor) there needs to be a target to hate. Or maybe to love? The left have made Conservatives/Republicans enemy number one. People are dying in the streets because conservatives are blocking universal healthcare! Bernie Sander‚Äôs stated that if conservatives repealed Obamacare 9/11 * 10 people would die every year because of the reversal (which is non-sense). Notice that it‚Äôs tied to a moral truth everyone accepts (people dying = bad) to those who oppose their arguments (also invoking 9/11).----Can Conservatives rebuild the positive message of Reagan, or is it no longer possible? Shining city on the hill, American Exceptionalism, Force for Peace and Justice? Young people are ideologues. The problem is when we invoke such unifying and positive messages they seem hollow because the left and their vast propaganda arm of the media have been attacking and undermining such messages since Reagan. They don‚Äôt want another Reagan Revolution where young people in droves flocked to Conservatives. Even after 9/11 when the country unified Republicans won *big*. Obama spent his entire presidency dismantling unity and pushing tribal politics with a seeming understanding that unity does not benefit the left what so ever. His administration pretended as if terrorism was over, that ISIS was a JV team and not worthy stressing out over, that Republicans were just racist which is why they wanted to stop illegal immigration. Their goals were to attempt to ensure no national unity would form around external threats like terrorism while also demonizing Republicans for caring about those issues. Culturally it was devastating as it worked two fold to further divide the country while also shutting down any means of unifying; that was the evil of Obama.Another Conservative emotional/moral appeal has been external threats. This seems to be the outlet that Trump has focused on. He does not turn his attacks on other Americans like the left does, but focuses on CHINA, and ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, and ‚Äúallies not carrying their weight‚Äù. Romney‚Äôs one instance of this in 2012 was to bring up rationally that Russia was mobilizing to affect American interests, which was dismissed by Democrats as ‚Äúgetting his foreign policy from the cold war‚Äù. The problem with Russia was that the young and emotionally driven demographics have no connection to them what so ever. While it was factually true, it had no weight. Illegal immigrants had weight as they were here by the tens of millions, there were drug cartels, murders, rapes, and whole slew of things that could be pointed to drive the moral and emotional appeal these demographics can latch onto.Now compare that to the Russian ‚Äúexternal threat‚Äù used against Trump. It‚Äôs not that Russians are the threat, it‚Äôs that Russia worked with Trump to steal the election. This fed the emotional/moral outrage the democrats felt for losing an election they were all but promised was theirs to win. How could Trump have won? He must have cheated (same thing implied about Bush in 2000). So democrats took something that was relevant to the emotional/moral outrage of their base (losing an election) and tied it to conservatives and an external force. This would be similar to if after 9/11 Republicans tied the Al Qaeda attackers to Democrats and claimed that since Clinton intentionally didn‚Äôt have Osama Bin Laden killed it led to the devastation of New York City. You take the moral/emotional outrage of what happened, and then you place the target on your political opposition. We see this with every mass shooting. Democrats gleefully skip to the podium through the blood and gore of each tragedy to claim ‚Äúif only Republicans would enact our gun laws, these kids would still be alive‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt matter that gun laws would have 0 percent chance of having stopped the tragedies, it is about the emotional/moral argument being made.----What has failed in both Trump and AOC is the personal attacks on them. It does nothing to dissuade their supporters or their popularity. But I think we do have an example of what can. Sarah Palin. She captured an emotional/moral up-swell that launched the Tea Party. The left and the media relentlessly attacked her from the moment she appeared at the RNC convention. Insulted her intelligence, her looks, her family, you name it. What finally killed Sarah Palin in terms of popularity and national recognition? Gabby Giffords shooting of 2011. It had done what all the other demonization could not have done which was tied her to a moral/emotional bad event. Rationally we know that Sarah Palin had 100% zero actual relevance to the mass shooting. But the media had successfully tied her to it, Obama implied she was the one at fault, and she made the mistake of seeming abashed and responsible. After that instant Palin fell off the radar and was dismissed by the public at large (though still maintained a small following).So an effective attack on a moral crusader such as Bernie, Obama, or AOC would be a moral failing that their base would find egregious. The problem is the left never apologizes for anything or take responsibility for anything so this may be hard to achieve. Bernie bro did a mass shooting at a Republican base ball game that could easily have been tied to Bernie‚Äôs explosive rhetoric. Was it a failure of Conservatives/Republicans not taking the chance they were given to torpedo Bernie and his movement? Yes it is morally wrong to tie the actions of a raving lunatic to a leader like Bernie, but from the political angle of stopping a populist/demagogue it maybe the only way to stop a movement based on zero rationalism.----This post goes all over the place. The main thrust here is how to deal with the segment of the population that is driven by emotions and moral arguments. Obama was confronted with the indisputable fact that raising Capital Gains taxes was bad for everyone. Meaning the poor, middle class, and rich would all be worse off. What was Obama‚Äôs response? ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter, it is only fair to raise those taxes‚Äù. His base *loved* him for this response. Rationalism and facts are distant thing to these types of people, that doesn‚Äôt mean we aren‚Äôt obligated to having a good rational basis for our positions. But if *we* do not speak in an emotional or moral based frame work we lose. And we lose hard.We are also confronted with the fact that the only way we can defeat these ‚Äúmoral‚Äù crusaders who lack any facts what so ever is by torpedoing them with a moral taboo. Something that is unforgivable to those that support them. Governor of Virginia talks casually of infanticide, this caused significant public backlash. As numerous people born or have children can imagine themselves being killed under such a policy. Yet the ‚Äúblack face‚Äù controversy seems to be what the Democrats and Media are attempting to punish him for.Is there a way to knock a moral crusader down without using shady tactics like blaming them for a mass shooting that they are only loosely related to? This is becoming increasingly important as the Democratic party is going to double and triple down on this type of tactic. And the longer we let nuts like AOC run loose the more minds she warps to her insanity. By not engaging in the moral/emotional background we are literally fighting with one hand tied behind our back. Which considering we have lost Academia, Hollywood, and the Media is not something we can afford to do.For those on your high horses about getting dirty (like Trump Conservatives have been screaming for) what are your solutions? Often times the high horse conservatives think that people will just hear their enlightened words and review the evidence and follow the facts. Reality suggests there is a lot portion of the electorate this is not true for (and yes they vote). If you are unwilling to get dirty are you willing to let this country get destroyed by progressive policies just so you can fill morally superior by not engaging in the mud?----I‚Äôll wrap this up with what I always say. The left is intellectually and morally bankrupt to their very core. They have no basis to exist as a party. Quite literally if we were a sane society it would be Conservatives vs. Libertarians as the two contesting parties. I disagree with Libertarians on a significant number of issues, but I can understand the intellectual rigor that goes into their arguments.So why have the left managed to not only survive but thrive when they lack an intellectual and moral foundation? Because they fight in an emotional/moral frame work dishonestly while conservatives barely put up a fight there. They are nearly uncontested in an arena that tens of millions of Americans solely pay attention to. Humans are emotional creatures first and foremost. We are failing to use the most basic of tools due to feeling that they are beneath us. And until we learn to use and fight with these tools we are doomed to watch generations of people get duped by a movement that has been debunked for nearly a century. If you are sitting on a high horse right now, you should feel like garbage considering what we are up against and how badly we are losing to it. nan It occurred to me that very few people actually take the time to look at a candidate's platform. [Michael Snyder](https://web.archive.org/web/20180106201451/https://www.michaelsnyderforcongress.com/issues.html) had a very descriptive platform that the Tea Party and other conservative groups would certainly have yearned for, yet in the end he lost overwhelmingly in the primary.Another example is the drama unfolding in Delaware's Congressional race. [Scott Walker](https://whyy.org/segments/gop-nominee-for-lone-delaware-congressional-seat-is-one-unusual-candidate/) had no platform, no website, and is known for simply making hand-made painted signs and hanging them anywhere and everywhere he can, legally or otherwise. The State GOP [distanced](https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/politics/2018/09/21/republican-u-s-house-nominee-scott-walker-renounced-delaware-gop/1382634002/) themselves completely over his random and presumed racist Facebook posts. His opponent [Lee Murphy](https://web.archive.org/web/20180905225819/https://gomurph.com/positions/), which lost, did have a platform, although a rather weak one.Do platforms have any real impact on elections? Does the average voter simply not care about the issues? nan nan Since Disney got in trouble with this a few years back I‚Äôve watched H1B issues for a while and with conservatives now in a position to do something I‚Äôm actually curious where conservatives stand on the matter.On one hand we have free market force.   On the other, we have what I and what I imagine conservatives (with nationalist ideals) would consider a violation of immigration laws and a violation of what H1B visas are for.What say you Conservatives?Is this a issue that we should take up?Most recent Article on the topic that got me thinking about this today:https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/08/21/h-1b-visa-reliant-cisco-secured-visas-for-foreign-workers-instead-of-hiring-u-s-citizens-report/ nan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-hkODj36CICalifornia conservative who is a part of the Hoover Institution. He has many great lectures and discussions that can be found on YouTube. In this one he addresses illegal immigration and how the parties have come to where they are at. Anyone who has been around for a while should remember that Democrats were not very supportive of illegal immigration. As in the primary demographic that they catered to was working "class" Americans who were being impacted by illegals.The interesting point made, though I believe is understood by many conservatives, is that this changed due to Obama's political discourse. He changed the Democratic Party into the party of Identity Politics in 2012. It always existed within their party, but hadn't been a major player until Obama. This change to identity politics is where Democrats completely betrayed their constituency on illegal immigrants and securing the border. Though I would argue the Democrats were never serious about addressing illegal immigration based on how they acted under Reagan and through the 90's.Was Obama the figure that made Identity Politics the hallmark of the modern Democratic Party (Obviously the party used identity politics throughout the late 19th and early 20th century)? The parties have raced to appeal to the growing Hispanic demographic for several decades. nan I was talking with a friend of mine who went to school for history and was surprised when he didn't have a favorable view of the abolitionists. He was of the opinion that the Civil War only came about because of the hard line in which the abolitionists polarized the subject and that they were hardly necessarily for ending slavery (and were actually counter productive). This kind of surprised me as I figured the abolitionists were viewed widely as a positive movement.I'm also currently going through the book Black Rednecks and White Liberals by Thomas Sowell and he has a very similar opinion on them. In his book he makes it clear that people like Abraham Lincoln were not abolitionists; they were anti-slavery. The divide being big enough that the abolitionists refused to back Lincoln in the presidential election and split the anti-slavery vote by running a third party candidate. Lincoln only won by a plurality in the election because of it; instead of a majority. And even after Lincoln freed the slaves; they still questioned whether they should vote for him in the next presidential election.Why were the abolitionists such a problem? Polarization of the issue and forcing the South to become hardliner on slavery and to ideologically justify the evil they were partaking in (as no one wants to be called evil). Abolitionists would not accept any "peace offerings" or "middle ground" that would help to slowly end slavery. They wanted all or nothing.Abolitionists were quite hated in their time and not just in the South. Sowell lists several instances of lynch mobs forming in the North to take out the abolitionists; in places where slavery was already illegal and the vast majority frowned on the institution. Why? Because the abolitionists were directly threatening the Union and were dividing the country. There were quite a few popular anti-Slavery people in the South, including Robert E. Lee the famous general who led the confederate army. Thomas Jefferson fought long and hard throughout his political career to end the salve trade and the expansion of slavery throughout the United States. But both of these figures valued the Union and wanted to ensure it survived the slow demise of slavery. Also the more moderate anti-slavery figures in the Union were concerned about how to deal with millions of former slaves (making up 1/3rd the entire population of the South) once they were freed. Abolitionists on the other hand had no care for consequences; only that it be ended immediately and severely. They even opposed slave owners being compensated in exchange for freeing their slaves (which is how the British Empire managed to peacefully end slavery across its many territories over the 19th century).----Slavery was an evil institution that spanned the entire globe and goes back to the earliest civilizations. Were the abolitionists in the wrong as my friend and Sowell concluded in terms of how they went about it? And can we learn something about that in regards to a vastly evil institution of Abortion and how we go about combating that? That issue is incredibly polarized to the point that people who are pro-life identify as pro-choice due to being Democrats.When you have such evil institutions ingrained within your society; what is the correct path forward to addressing it? The emotional response is to go on a crusade and end it immediately. But as Americans found out; the Civil war cost 1 life per 6 slaves freed. And the monetary cost was through the roof. Had the U.S. adopted the British method of paying off the South in exchange for freeing their slaves it was concluded that 1 year of 50% US GDP was necessary to achieve. Which is one of the main reasons that route was not approached. Though the cost of the Civil War was even higher. nan Why did Russia fail at Capitalism? We saw wide spread corruption and powerful oil companies take over in Russia after the end of the cold war. And while the country was technically better off than it was under Socialism, what did the Russians do wrong? What can we learn from their mistakes?Is this just a matter of culture/values? As in Capitalism and Democracy requires the people to have an intellectual and ethical foundation to be successful? We saw similar failures and corruption in Iraq and Afghanistan as we were "nation building".----Short post. But it's something conservatives should be thinking about to ensure a similar failure does not occur in the United States. nan I'd like to get some discussion here because what I have seen elsewhere has been light on details and explanation. These sanctions on Russia passed Congress almost unanimously and President Trump has apparently said he isn't going to enforce them. Do we know what the rationale is for not enforcing the sanctions?  nan Recently Sargon of Akkad had a debate with Richard Spencer, and while I think Sargon did win with his fair share of mistakes, but the Alt-Right came out en masse to defend Richard Spencer. Many of which tried to convince Sargon that the Alt-Right is not an enemy. I thought about that idea for a bit. Should we attack the Alt-Right or should we use them as useful idiots? nan conservatism is not about freedom, it's about the preservation of culture and a particular version of the good life. libertarianism has no concern for the nation or community; it is about maximizing individual freedom while minimizing harm to others. the notion that conservatism is anti-statist is reductive and confuses CLASSICAL liberalism, the philosophy upon which libertarianism (and the declaration of independence) is based, and conservatism when in fact CLASSICAL liberalism was a repudiation of conservatism.what say you?(classical liberalism: john stuart mill, john locke, etc.) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5L74zlKgHlQOver the last year I have posted several topis in relation to this. Might as well bring it back up again :).The above link is a 10 minute video by Dailywire Michael Knowles and he is covering this topic from subtle relabeling of topics in order to partially lie or confuse people. He refers to this as "soft language" and how it is deceiving as it takes away any edge of what that word/label means.The common leftist defense of anyone questioning them on this tactic is we are just "arguing semantics". Semantic is defined as:"relating to meaning in language or logic."Meaning it is a very important argument especially when the left abuses language to push their politics. They know they are wrong; so they misuse language in a subtle way so as not to look completely retarded while doing it. If they misused it too much people would just laugh at them and how ridiculous they are. But subtle misuses allow them to slide the discussion into their favor.----I have referred to this in the past as "Framing the Discussion." Or as Shapiro has stated when you are in an argument never allow them to frame the context of the debate. When they misuse words that is *exactly* what they are doing.One of the greatest achievements of the left using this tactic was in regards to "Gay Marriage". We are not facing it via gender and other redefinitions to suite the world view of the left. Gay/Same Sex Marriage was an oxymoron, in the sense that the left used it.Same sex marriage; gays were perfectly capable of getting married but they typically would not want to. What marriage was; as used for thousands upon thousands of years was a "Union between a man and woman." A definition that quite literally can't have same sex at its core. I could write a 20 page discussion on this topic alone; so we will leave that there. I am actually quite surprised to see Michael Knowles make this case; as I have been making it for years (before proposition 8 passed). Conservative let the left frame the debate with "Marriage Equality" or "Rights" and we lost sight of what they were doing there.A more recent one is "State Capitalism". Another oxymoron; but sounds good and the useful idiots believe it. They are calling the horrific situation in Venezuela "State Capitalism" after it became apparent how it was collapsing how how horrible it was there. Capitalism is defined by *no state ownership of the means of capital*. It is quite literally built into the definition. So they throw "State" on the front and they can tie the failure there to Capitalism while pretending as if socialism still needed "proper" implementation.Or how they renamed "Supplied Side Economics" which doesn't dispute demand; but only suggests that supply is being hindered and that policy relaxing supply side restrictions will be a boon to the over all economy. They call it "Trickle Down Economics". A made up term with a sinister suggestion that the people will just get the run off from the super wealthy and rich. At no point does supply side claim taxes or regulations cut will just fall into the pockets of the poor. It only suggests the economy will be more healthy and vibrant meaning more opportunities for all and more growth for all.----Social Justice Warriors are an effort to ensure this; but it seems a bit too obvious and is blowing back in their faces. Have the social justice warriors had an effect for the left that is positive? Or has it created this reactive element among Trump supporters due to being too obvious?Social Justice itself being a lie. It sounds good do to its name right? We all like to hear and support justice. Social Justice has the opposite meaning of real justice; yet they use it. It takes definitive made up groups and associates different standards for them. As in a Hispanic who commits murder would not receive the same time in jail as a white man who commits murder because he comes from X victim group. That is the opposite of what Justice is.Obama made it clear he saw the SCOTUS's job to ensure Social Justice. Let that sink in. Part of the reason I've been really happy with originalist justices being put on the federal courts this year in record numbers. It is down right scary what the left is attempting to do there.----Should conservatives care more about this? Does it seem nit picky? Is Trump good on this aspect of the culture war? Is it easy to just say "Who cares?" This soft attack on culture has huge impacts on everything in life even political discourse. Being able to manipulate language as a political movement is a huge power we should stop at all costs. Especially when they use that manipulated language to enshrine it into law via Judicial Activism.This is a long post. Feel free to take a jab at any part. The ten minute video is pretty on point; I just went on a few tangents for this discussion. nan nan Looks like it will be passed tomorrow. I see one of the chief arguments against it being the CBO 1.5 Trillion over 10 years increase in the debt.Conservatives, specifically Tea Partiers, ran on cutting deficits and paying down debt. Are the lack of tea parties resistance of this bill hypocrisy? Or do the positives just out weight the negatives?Should spending cuts even be addressed in a bill that is focused on "tax reform"? Is it disingenuous to claim it should be tackling the deficit when conservatives believe the only true way to do that is through spending cuts and entitlement reform?Why do Democrats suddenly care about deficits? Is it like how they suddenly cared about Russia when ignoring it for 8 years?While economists are very pessimistic on the laffer curve and our location on it (many think we're on the left side; while conservatives typically believe we're on the right side) do you think we will see a growth in deficits based on tax cuts?Lastly early on in the Obama administration when Republicans took hold of the house there was polling done that showed conservatives opposed tax increases even if it meant sizable government spending cuts. I forgot the exact ratio; but would you support a 2 to 1 ratio if it meant getting spending under control?----Or just general thoughts on this one successful bill out of Congress (hopefully)? http://time.com/4585232/white-deaths-exceed-births-united-states/https://www.rt.com/usa/us-white-births-census-613/http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/02/07/second-generation-americans/>Given current immigration trends and birth rates, virtually all (93%) of the growth of the nation‚Äôs working-age population between now and 2050 will be accounted for by immigrants and their U.S.-born children, according to a population projection by the Pew Research Center.----I can't find the study I had read a few months back that showed the birth/death ratio of different demographics but the above links give you an idea. You need roughly 2.1 ratio for the nation to grow or at least stay stagnate. Europe is way below this; Russia is at like 1.3 and its population in 50 years will be much smaller than it is today. Which for a resource hungry China means they will likely get into a war with the Chinese and lose horribly.From that study it showed that the only demographic in the United States that has consistently had the higher birth rates are first generation immigrants. White people based on the above links are floating around 1.4 (meaning in 50 years our total population will be less than today if the rate stays consistent). Mean while the only reason our population grows is due to the 1 million immigrants we have a year. The only reason our birth rate is viable is that those immigrants are having lots of children.The immigrant (legal, not talking about illegal) group with the highest birthrate are Hispanic Americans. After the first generation we see a drop off in birth rates among second and third generation immigrant families. ----So what's the problem you ask? For one: Multiculturalism. In 50 years time a *very* sizable portion of our population will be first and second generation immigrants. A lot of those being Hispanic especially if we keep cheating immigrants and granting amnesty. Which explains the vast pandering by both political parties to that group. The left has gone out of its way to *ensure* new immigrants are not assimilating and integrating within our culture and society. More than that the cultural Marxists have figured out they can pander to these groups as they are typically from a lower economic position and can warp the cultural perception and interests. We will have more and more Americans who are not rooted in traditional American culture as the predominant population and it's approaching quite rapidly.The other problem is a population that does not grow will have significant economic impacts especially when dealing with the care of a large burdensome elderly population. Though we must consider over population as a problem; but at the same time India, China, and vast swathes of the world are not slowing down population growth. So our population control measures only act to breed our population out of existence/dominance.----60 million babies have been aborted since the horrific ruling of Roe v. wade was decided. Based on the age of that ruling; many of those babies would have had babies, and some of those babies would have had babies.Is it in your mind a bad thing that our culturally rooted populations are being replaced? Will those new immigrant populations integrate even though the left is determined to see that they are not? And how much population control should we worry about? Are conservatives in serious trouble as we are rooted in a value system that will inherently not be something the immigrants value. Thus putting us and their children into conflict?Are there any actions we can do to avoid this? GOP pandering? Amnesty? Free cookies for all? Hi everyone.I'm working on evaluating my previous conclusions.I'm hoping to have a discussion about Israel and Palestine. Unfortunately, those who are on the right, generally support Israel universally, as if they've never done wrong; and those on the left generally support the Palestinians universally, as if Israel has never done right.It's hard to get information presenting any sort of balance.I've generally been in the first camp.However, I recently (tonight) watched a video made by a fellow (in response to Paul Joseph Watson) with whom I generally agree. He's a bit further to the libertarian side than I am, and seems to be forcefully in the "moderate middle" on every issue, after his libertarianism.... this bugs me, but it's not a deal breaker. At any rate, He's one whom I have generally found to be informative and (usually) accurate. When he's not accurate, he's usually at least well thought out.Here's a link to the video, for those who want to watch it:http://justinking.org/jerusalem-palestine-israel-and-infowars/Anywho, he seems to fall further into the typical "left" column of "Palestinians are the victims of an Israeli aggressor," which seems... contrary to his many other stances.So... forgive my rambling: I'm hoping to have some measure of balance on the issue from those who, like me, are on the "right." I am not interested in partisan anti-Israel pandering (which has made my searches on this topic frustrating), nor am I interested in those who's pretense is "Israel can do no wrong," and then attempt to go from there.... even if my bias leans me toward believing that camp.Why might the move of the embassy to Jerusalem be a wrong choice? What is the defense of civilians moving into the settlements, what is the current stance of Israel on the settlements, settlements, settlements, settlements.... why are the numbers of Palestinian children's deaths so high by IDF forces?What's wrong with a divided Jerusalem, for both Israel and Palestinians? Who supports that idea, and who opposes it?I don't want to imply that I'm coming into this ignorantly, I'm not, but I also want to be careful not to have my presuppositions supported because they aren't countered... you know? So... if there's distinctly 2 sides to an issue, or one where the right has it wrong.... eli5.Prager U's videos on the topic are informative, and I've watched them all... so... if you're going to post them, would you also give me your take on them? Anyway, thanks everyone. Hopefully this isn't just a "your such an idiot" question, and can actually be a good area for conversation. Help me challenge my ideas! There is a substantial amount of disdain for Trump due to his lack of respect. He talks over people, he insults people, he makes up and exaggerates stories about people. It's something we as conservatives value and try and follow in the daily interactions of our lives. It's a good rule to follow; as people who treat each other with respect will be able to work towards common goals and we will typically be happier for it.----What is respect? The following two definitions seem to be at play in this reference.1.) : an act of giving particular attention : consideration2.) a : high or special regard : esteemb : the quality or state of being esteemedc respects plural : expressions of high or special regard or deference paid our respectsWe would like to give consideration to those around us in what they say and think. Do we necessarily give high esteem to those individuals? No but we do give high esteem to free speech and diversity of thought/view. While we may disagree we value the ability to disagree and hear each other out.There are two things that need to be taken into consideration first though. Often respect is earned and nearly always in order to garner respect you must also show respect for the individual you are interacting with.  What happens when you show respect to someone who does not respect you and has done nothing to earn that respect?Respect is a two way street. If only one side is showing respect to the other there is a serious problem. Now you might say: well the person showing respect will garner support from the masses in terms of political discourse. In politics that *never* seems to be the case (anymore at least).McCain and Romney were good, honorable, and very respectful to Obama in their elections. Meanwhile they were met with ridicule, slander, and outright insults. Debates; the decorum where you would expect individuals to be more respectful and knowledgeable. Obama was awarded "winning" a debate against Romney by ridiculing him on foreign policy instead of actually dealing with the issues he was clearly incompetent on "the 80's want their foreign policy back".Not only in political discourse between candidates; but after the 2004 election we saw the media drop all pretense of respect for Bush. He continued to show them respect and held his office with dignity and honor. The media went after him relentlessly which led to the rise of Pelosi and Reid in congress. When the Bush administration had come out to state that Iran was seeking a nuclear program and the Democrats leaked old CIA intel contradicting that; an Anchor on CNN called him an idiot. We know he was correct now; but it didn't matter. It was the complete and utter disrespect from the media of a sitting president.----Trump supporters were infuriated with Republicans as they would never hit back. They would respect the media and their opponents who in turn mocked and scorned them. This seems to be the divide between various conservatives. Shapiro has addressed this in many of his college campus lectures (specifically about debating); if the person you are interacting with is not willing to be respectful you need to point that out and hit them back. You are not going to have a reasonable discussion with someone that does not respect you or your right to have a different opinion.I have seen several posters on here and on /r/conservative that have made it clear that Trump's mannerisms (disrespect) is of high importance to them. McCain who prides himself on his stately manner and respect holds that grudge against Trump as well. But is that truly respect? When Romney was disrespected repeatedly by Obama; he was rightly upset about it. But did the public see it that way? No; they thought something was wrong with him. As who would take an insult or slander like that and not hit back? There had to be something wrong with him.To put simply; in your personal life would you continue to show someone respect if all they did was jeer you, spit at you, and insult you? As that is the metaphorical effect of what the media has been doing to Republicans for over 10 years. You wouldn't necessarily spit back and jeer them; but you would show them complete and absolute disdain for their actions. Funny enough you see McCain doing this Trump; but has *never* done this to Democrats or the media who are constantly spitting and jeering him.----At this point in political discourse the time for showing the opposition respect is past. Until which time as they are willing to show us respect; it is only harmful to show them respect. In a sense when you show a particular person or group respect you legitimize what they are doing. As I have brought up in previous discussions: who would you rather support the incompetent person or the evil person? When we show respect we disagree and tell people they are wrong or ignorant on the subject. When they respond with we are evil or we are out to get specific groups with our policy it has a negative effect. We project a good intent onto them; while they project an ill intent upon us.Trumpism may not be the specific tactic to use. As we don't need to be jeering, spitting, and name calling like the left does. But at the same time we need to ensure that respect is only given to those who earn/deserve it (which Democrats have not in recent years). In effect; we need to be "hitting back". How we hit back is important and how the Republicans have handled it so far has been poor.----And finally. How do we break this cold war of disrespect and hatred between opposing parties? I have mentioned in the past that we stand up to the bad behavior until the left realizes the destructive nature of their movement. But when there are political gains for such destructive nature at the cost of our country; what is to stop them? Appeal to their patriotism? They have none. Appeal to their love of their neighbor? Non-existent due to their tribal politics; their neighbor is out to get them only the state can help. Clearly this isn't all Democrats; but their current value systems no longer align with ours for the most part.Respect is crucial for a Democratic system as ours to thrive and survive. But respect is a two way street; if only one side is showing respect that isn't truly respect. You're only disrespecting yourself and everyone sees it. Bush did garner some respect from Democrats in the aftermath of 9/11 in terms of how he responded and led on the issue. Though they lost substantial political power when the country united in that way. Does the country need an external threat?----What should conservatives do to foster respect; and how should it guide our political discourse? If the opposition has thrown respect out the window; what options do we have left to us? Is showing respect to someone who doesn't respect you a form of virtue signaling that does more harm than good? nan nan nan One of the pure wealth taxes we have in this country. The money has already been taxed via income to generate that wealth.The only reason to support an Estate/Death tax is via  a moral argument as far as I am aware.- People should work for their wealth. Inheriting over $5,000,000 sets a person for life. You would have to be the stupidest of the stupid to not be fairly comfortable and wealthy for the rest of your life.- Transfers of vast wealth creates a form of "Nobility" that the founders were not interested in perpetuating in the United States.Based on the Cruz vs. Sanders debate; Cruz made some good arguments about the people being hurt the most are the scenarios with Business capital and the "wealth" making it so that business cannot continue. Assuming this wasn't the case (as in a new Business tax code that no longer lumps individual wealth with business) what other reasons should we oppose the Estate Tax? Bill Gate's children for instance will never have to work a day in their lives and be left wing political activists for the entirety of it. In a sense we dislike parasites at all levels of society, or we should, and the lack of estate tax does seem to perpetuate the leeches at the top.----This post is intentionally set to challenge conservatives. As we all oppose the Death Tax. Please feel free to explore this. nan "The act or practice of reasoning or decision-making by a group, especially when characterized by uncritical acceptance or conformity to prevailing points of view."Recently we have seen cracks in the groupthink of "Climate Science" finally start to break open. It is a fascinating test group as a large number of those involved in the groupthink were scientists. We're talking about highly intelligent people who should be avid critical thinkers. The very concept of "Consensus" and "Settled Science" were being pushed by the political elements were mostly supported by the climate scientist alarmists even though such principles violate the very core of scientific theory and the process in which science is approached.----Are scientists not taught appropriate amounts of critical thinking or is that critical thinking some how lost in their pursuit of their Phds? Or is Groupthink a much more powerful force that even highly intelligent people with high critical thinking skills can still be sucked into?We have talked about intelligent people in general being too specialized. And in science yes; they are specialized in their specific fields. But at the same time their willingness to accept this is not normal; even in a normal group of people much less people of their caliber. How do we go about identifying Groupthink (even among conservative movements) and how do we go about dismantling it? If you find someone who has been sucked into such a phenomenon; what is the best way to wean them off of it? Is groupthink ever a good thing to allow or to employ? Does our K-12 education system automatically teach groupthink as a normal pursuit of knowledge and truth? For a while we have noted a severe lack of critical thinking skills in the population (which is why the internet has not ushered in an age of enlightenment).----This discussion should be focused on Groupthink and not climate change. Climate change was only used as a point in which to start the conversation and is not the topic for discussion.

With ever growing confirmation bias among our population it is clear that is a significant cultural problem with our country right now. People would rather read sources that show that them and their "team" is correct than read the truth or an opposing opinion. Regardless the media itself has abandoned all pretense of unbiased journalism or attempting to just "report the news". They have been in a game of controlling the narrative and pushing political spin towards the left. They have always been biased; but there is orchestrated efforts by the media to do this now (made possible by community organization via the internet).----1. What should journalism be like?2. How can we help encourage journalism to take that form?3. Can government help? Such as the annoying regulations for medicine that forces the companies to list all their side effects. A regulation that journalists identify their biases and affiliations before every story; and editors/papers do the same.4. As I mentioned in the beginning this is a cultural problem. How does our culture need to change in order to facilitate a better exchange of news/opinions where confirmation bias doesn't run amok? nan I know it cannot relate to Conservatism itself, Liberalism, and ProgressevismConservatism is relative to what is being conservedLiberalism to what you are liberating fromProgressivism to the progress you are trying to makeWhat defines left-wings policies and right-wing policies outside of those 3 which I have (kinda) debunked? nan nan Do you support the death penalty?

What are your thoughts on this? Personally I have been rather annoyed with Google and how Youtube has been acting in recent years against conservatives. They are a far left organization that seems to show no qualms about throwing in the with the left every chance they can get.I saw something like this recently happen with Netflix a few years back. Shortly after Netflix started it streaming side of the company (which exploded in marketshare) many movie/t.v. studios jacked up their licensing rates as soon as they could come up with a "competitor" to the streaming giant. Netflix took the path of creating original content and is doing incredibly well with its subscription base. Youtube's subscription based service is a large flop and their advertising could be devestated by this latest corporate war.Crowder has had a few videos annoyed with YouTube's targeting of conservative content releasers related to the the above video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kAYODuIPro&t=144s nan nan nan Hey, I was wondering whether or not this community would want a discord server.

I thing, due to the level of discussion in this community, I think that setting up a discord server isn't to crazy of an idea.So, would y'all want a discord server? If so, what purposes should it serve? If not, why?Note: All rules of r/ConservativeLounge will apply and all moderators would retain there position on the discord server. From the LA Times (I guess my link didn't work).  Here's the link again **[LA Times Opinion](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-friedersdorf-democrats-own-california-20170303-story.html)**.Here's the full article:By Conor FriedersdorfPartisans cherish a persistent illusion: Everything would be fantastic if it wasn't for those dopes in the other party. Yet, as one side gains power, its ability to pass the buck invariably wanes.In Washington, where Republicans now control the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives, there is no one else to blame if the healthcare system, the tax code and the economy do not improve, or if the environment deteriorates and our foreign enemies assert themselves. For the next two years, the GOP owns every federal policy success and failure. Many Californians fear the worst from the GOP‚Äôs virtual monopoly. President Trump is unpopular here. So are the Republicans. In fact, Golden State officials have positioned themselves as a bulwark of "resistance" to significant parts of their agenda.Gov. Jerry Brown is defiant on environmental policy. Sheila Kuehl of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has encouraged people "to engage in any way they can to slow down anything that might come from the federal departments and Congress,‚Äù declaring that "you can‚Äôt just be dormant when fascism is growing.‚ÄùWe're a case study in what a political community looks like when Republicans wield little or no power.  On many matters, state and local officials ought to oppose the Trump administration's populist nationalism, in accordance with the United States‚Äô federalist system and the 10th Amendment.At the same time, California Democrats cannot cast themselves as a mere resistance movement, for the simple reason that, in the Golden State, their power far surpasses the Republican advantage in Washington.California voters have elected a Democratic governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state, treasurer, controller and insurance commissioner. The state Senate has more than twice as many Democrats as Republicans. So does the state Assembly. Democratic mayors preside in San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, Long Beach and Los Angeles.  We're a case study in what a political community looks like when Republicans wield little or no power ‚Äî and an ongoing refutation of the conceit that but for the GOP, the United States would be free of dysfunction.Sure, the Golden State gets a lot right. It‚Äôs the sixth-largest economy in the world.But California ranks in the lowest fifth of states in education. Housing costs are out of control. Our major cities face a crisis of homelessness. Our police officers kill citizens at rates comparable to the rest of the country. Our infrastructure is severely overstressed due to underinvestment. The bullet train project meant to connect L.A. to the Bay Area is a national joke. Our counties, cities and schools are being crushed by an unsustainable pension burden. Our taxes are already among the nation's highest.And it is no longer plausible to blame any of this on Republicans. For the foreseeable future, Democrats own every Golden State success and failure.That ought to be a wake-up call, even if the California GOP remains too incompetent to win.Most California public servants are nothing if not earnest in their horror at the direction President Trump is taking the country. Few seem to realize that they're in a position to oppose Trumpism in a manner much more powerful than defiant statements and fleeting acts of resistance. They are in a position to govern well in the nation's biggest state.They can be the change they want to see in government ‚Äî and demonstrate to the country that Democrats know how to improve American communities.To govern badly is always a failure of the public's trust. To do so now, as a public servant in California ‚Äî to ignore dysfunction in deference to a special interest group or kick problems down the road to avoid the difficulty of solving them ‚Äî isn't just a betrayal of the public, it is high-octane fuel for the ascendant Trump coalition.The national GOP is deeply flawed. Until Democrats acknowledge that those flaws are mostly inconsequential when it comes to what ails California, the Golden State will fall short of its potential, and the rest of the country will reject even the best of what we have to offer.Positive leadership by example will always be more compelling than mere opposition.Conor Friedersdorf is a contributing writer to Opinion, a staff writer at the Atlantic and founding editor of the Best of Journalism, a newsletter that curates exceptional nonfiction. Not too long of a video from CPAC from Cruz on various topics concerning conservatives.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ00yFEYmkUTopics Discussed:----1. Ted Cruz nails the 9th and 4th District courts for complete lawlessness. They completely failed to cite the statute by congress giving the president the power (or not); but instead just stated they didn't like it. And the 4th district court pretty much pulled up a rule out of its ass completely contradictory to what the founders actually wrote the 2nd amendment for.2. Regulatory state according to Cruz allows the people to be regulated without any discourse. If the legislators had to vote on each regulation; they would be accountable to the people for their actions. Cruz seems to suggest that Trump will face legal challenges as these agencies are not 100% answerable to the president. They act as independent regulatory agencies (even worse) that have zero accoutability in how they were setup.3. The third topic is about how the left has gone off the deep end. Cruz has stated that they are in opposition over every thing, even mundane activites such as "approving the journal" (which he claims he has no clue what it means). The lesson from this election that Democrats have taken away it is that they were "too moderate" and that Hillary was "too moderate" and that was why they lost. They are afraid they will be primaried if they are seen working with Republicans at all or even worse Trump. Now this seems eerily familiar to some Tea Party type activism. Was the Tea Party this bad?4. Cruz moves on to talk about solutions. He mentions first confirmation, which deals with the nuclear option that Reid used. He doesn't actually addresss the other two options to tackle leftist opposition as he seemse to have gotten distracted.5. Supreme court vacancies, they mention the obvious fact that Scalia was a defensive seat for us to replace. We were on the defensive in ensuring his seat remained originalist. The left will make the case that the next one is "their seat", as in (Levin makes the quip) we can only have so many people faithful to the Constitution on the court. Cruz believes this new opening will occur this summer and that the will throw everything they have at stopping Republicans as it will be a huge shift in the court function back to Rule of law.6. Cruz transitions the Rule of Law discussion to the border. I'll take a moment to note for those of us discussing the Culture War and "Trump Conservatives" this is how we entice them into adopting more conservative positions: Rule of Law, Constitution, Border Protection. Trump conservatives are all about the border; and if we keep connecting them to the Rule of Law, which further connects them to the Constitution we will have many new recruits in the future. I won't side track this anymore ;). Cruz mentions that the very perception of Trump has made is so illegal crossings have literally dropped by 50% since inauguration.7. Cruz's last topic is about congressional productivity and what he see's as their job. And he encourages members of CPAC to keep both the Media and Congress accountable. The following are 2017 items he thinks should be accomplished: 1.) Repeal the ACA 2.) Confirm a "strong conservative" to the Supreme Court 3.) Pass fundmental tax reform, ideally a flat tax in his opinion 4.) And the less likely one, defund the United Nations until they start acting in a lawful fashion (in recoginizing the League of Nation accords).----Seems like the repeal of ACA (and presumably the replacement) along with the tax reform will be the large legislative items for this year according to Cruz. nan nan nan nan nan I was just on the sub /r/fuckthealtright.  It spews a level of hate on par with white supremacy.  They're like the Westboro Baptist Church of liberals from what I'm seeing.  They have around 14k subscribers (right now).My question is this, in looking over the posts there, where do most progressives draw the proverbial line from what is a (say) '*mainstream conservative*' to where they label you with their version of the n-word "**altrightist**"?Is gay tolerance that is their burning bush?  The mods seemingly self-identify as all being gay: which I have no problem with.  Is it support of President Trump?  Is their argument that if you support Trump - you're alt-right?  Because by my estimation, and that of most traditional conservatives, Trump is a centrist (social liberal - married twice - son-in-law is a Jew - daughter converted).What value is it that a Conservative supports that goes over their line?  Or have they simply labeled *everyone* on the right, the alt-right?  It would seem to me, the same way they've basically labeled *all* white people racist, all gun owners lunatics, all Christians zealots and all men sexist pigs they've simply decided we're **all** horrible people.  SMH.  They're the extremists.  Just look at the posts.  It is easy for either side to grab headlines of the worst from our ideologies and paint everyone with that brush.  So if we (as conservatives) have to take ownership of idiots who shoot people in the name of racism, then wouldn't by similar logic, the liberals have to own all their criminals too?  Then, wouldn't their ranks be littered with a much greater number of killers, thieves and people who hate tribally?They seem lost. nan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prIHlv9ohfcInteresting video on the culture war by Andrew Klavan. As conservatives we witnessed this type activity before (which Klavan doesn't address here) which is what the media did to Bush between 2004-2008. Yes I know quite a few people dislike Bush for the actions he took in those years on the conservative side, but there was a much larger cultural war being waged against him.John Gibson (talk radio host I used to listen to early on in the Obama years) wrote a book on it called "How the left Swiftboated America". It is completely on point to what the left is rolling out again (they didn't even change their tactics) against Trump. No matter if you dislike Bush or Trump, you need to understand these tactics and take them seriously as it has serious repercussions for actual conservatives (whether or not you think they represent conservatives).Gibson's book talked about a tactic used by a 3rd party group called the Swift boat Veterans of America and their campaign against John Kerry in the 2004 election. John Kerry is one terrible human piece of trash for the activities he engaged in after Vietnam and through his political career, but his military record was pretty reasonable. This political group repeated plausible lies over and over again to undermine his character and his honor during that war to the point that most people doubted that he hadn't been a coward during the war who had nearly betrayed men serving under him.After Bush won that election the left learned this political tactic and employed it across all their venues. Major media outlets, Hollywood, comedy shows, major politicians all ran with the narrative (as we now understand they act as a propaganda arm of the Democratic Party). How?1. Attacked his intelligence. Compared him to monkeys. Brought on people onto news shows that would imply that he suffers from some mental damage which is why he has speaking problems. Bush was a bumbling idiot who is a disgrace and embarrassment to us and the entire globe is laughing at our "monkey" president.2. Attack his principles. Bush due to 9/11 was considered a very principled individual who wanted to ensure that American would remain safe. They fabricated "Bush Lied People Died" and spread it to every corner of journalism and Hollywood, to the point that Americans started to believe it. There are still leftists to this day that repeat this nonsense even though it has been debunked nearly a half dozen times. This is more nefarious than the 9/11 Truthers (which were also a fringe leftist movement with insanely worse implications than the Birthers) that main stream democrats actually played along with (even those who we know for a fact had the same intelligence as Bush and voted to go to war with Iraq, Pelosi...)3. Constantly protested him. It creates the facade of wide spread dissatisfaction that the News media was overly eager to cover. Notice how the protests never once repeated under Obama (not fucking once, those hypocritical fucking cock suckers). Also notice how the media stopped covered "death tolls" in the wars once Obama was elected. It was nearly a daily barrage by the media to undermine that terrible toll Bush's decisions had (as all presidents decisions have).This frames the issues. You undermine the competency of the person, then you undermine their credibility/respectability, then you organize mock outrage and protests. You keep repeating these lies daily and eventually a large enough segment of the population will start to believe it. Leftists will be energized and motivated as having a "true cause" to fight for. Moderates will be convinced that "Republicans" at large fucked up and have done horrible things so we should put those incompetent Democrats back into power. And finally Republicans are demoralized as their person who is fighting for their cause just seem so shitty (more so than they actually are).I'd also like to point out that the left was rolling out these type of attacks against Cruz. So before you just state "well they were just shitty", you're allowing yourself to being blinded to the culture war that is happening right in front of your very eyes. Cruz at the start of the primaries was considered a principled uncompromising zealot of a conservative. Annoying for the GOP leadership, but something most people could respect (and they did). Once Cruz looked like he had a serious chance of becoming president the left (which wanted Trump as the nominee, and also feared a Cruz presidency) started rolling out the character attacks (on social media, journalism, and comedic shows). He became a religious zealot (not a constitutionalist, or conservative) who wanted to enact religious law and was a Dominionist (a made up word by leftists in the early 90's in order to fear monger against religious people pushing back against their secular fascism). Then they started claiming that all of his stances were "made up" and that he was an opportunist that just wanted power. And finally with the help of Marco Rubio and Donald Trump they were able to smear him as a liar. These things were and have stuck to Cruz and even conservatives (supposedly principled ones) I saw repeatedly that shit latter in the primary. That is how effective this cultural war tactic is; it's not even politics it more nefarious than that.This was also effectively employed against Sarah Palin (who had many flaws) but you can see how they went after her. I won't extrapolate on that campaign by the left.Now arguably Trump and Bush have major flaws in the eyes of conservatives. But they always have had those flaws. This cultural war tactic of "Swiftboating" has long reaching affects that need to be counteracted immediately by conservatives. Do what Ben does and call out the "Good Trump" and "Bad Trump"; but you need to proactively call out the shitty tactics on play here. They have another "woman's march" coming up in march, it's non-sense. Do not be afraid to call it out as such on Facebook or to any person you talk to. Point out the tribal politics and the evil of such a divisive action. When the left blows up over every little mis-step of the Trump administration, don't feel the need to jump on the train. Yes admit it was dumb, but do not give them the control of the narrative which is "Trump administration is in Chaos" (as all the leftist headlines have been pushing for weeks now).This isn't spontaneous protests over a YouTube video. This is planned and orchestrated by the intellectual backers of the left and they are using the useful idiots to be their tools. To quote Rubio "The left knows exactly what it is doing". This tactic was incredibly successful from 2004-2008. Bush went from being the most popular president ever recorded (yes he didn't deserve that) to one of the least popular due to this cultural war tactic (which he also didn't deserve). The left wasted no time in employing this successful tactic against a new Republican president, and they will use it to destroy our congressional leads as well as potentially capture the presidency in 2020. And while Trump "makes it easy" for them; they would be pulling this on Cruz, Rand Paul, Scott Walker (as they also did in his state), Rick Perry or any other candidate that became the president.It is said that generation Z is the most conservative, the culture war will be the most effective against the young. Let us not lose the advantage we have to right this country. nan nan nan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0G96ixwKsE&t=0sShapiro starts talking with him about 5 minutes into the video.Thoughts on this so called traditional democrat? Dump the income tax in favor of larger estate taxes (though only for the "obscenely rich"). Should we care about the Paris Hiltons of the world? This is mostly a moral/ethical discussion. Is it alright that there are people so far removed from doing anything good or productive yet they are insanely rich?On /r/conservative I have made arguments about how conservatives seem to only "care" about the leeches on the bottom of the economic ladder. But there are leeches at all levels of economic ladder. From the work of fiction from Ayn Rand we saw some characters that represent these at the "top". Should conservatives endorse any system that reduces leeches? Or should we not care? nan nan nan nan This quote is from Russell Kirk's "The Conservative Mind""The Modern South cannot be said to obey any consciously conservative ideas- only conservative instincts, exposed to all the corruption that instinct, unlit by principle, encounters in a literate age."What are your thoughts on this quote? It was written in 1953, but I think it is juast as if not more true today than it was then. nan nan nan The more I look into this issue the more I realize it's more complex than you would assume and that there isn't a simple solution.The most common conservative solutions involve school choice (voucher programs, & charter schools).  The idea being that competition will force public schools to either reform to compete or be replaced by more competent schools.  These reforms have had limited success.  Private schools (usually religious - Jewish, Catholic, Baptist) perform the best, then non-profit charter schools, then public schools.  For-profit charter schools are surprisingly inconsistent, ranging from near the best to near the worst.  However, the difference in student performance among the different types of schools, while often significant, usually does not live up to expectations.  * The problem with for-profit schools.  For-profit K-12 schools are dying off nationwide.  It's simply a business model that isn't going to work.  The concept behind for-profit schools was to reduce administrative costs through efficiency.  The problem is that the laws are different and often conflicting from state-to-state and for each local district within each state.  Most states also have laws preventing one company from controlling too many schools, meaning the only way to expand was to spread out across more states.  The regulatory compliance burden is more expensive than any efficiency savings. * Get the parents more involved.  This seems to be the first answer of every teacher I've ever met.  It is a valid for most students that the more involved the parents are the better they do in school.  However this is an empty excuse when it comes to the students whose parents will never be involved.  We're now often dealing with third generation kids from failed schools.  Their parents and grandparents dropped out of school themselves and many are borderline illiterate.  These are the kids who most need education to improve their lives.  We need a solution that educates kids regardless of their family situation.* The impact of charter schools on public education.  When new charter schools open in a district guess which kids are more likely to attend.  That's right, the ones with involved parents who can work through the process.  The charter schools also have the benefit of being able to hire whichever teachers they want and they often take the best teachers from the local district.  This leaves the kids who are most in need of help stranded in the public system with fewer resources and the lowest quality teachers.* Teachers Unions  Teachers unions are an enormous part of the problem.  With teachers unions everything is based on seniority instead of performance.  Schools cannot remove ineffective teachers who do the bare minimum.  When layoffs come around the young teachers are the first to be fired regardless of capability.  A California district famously laid off their teacher of the year due to lack of seniority.  The unions also fight nearly every attempt at reform while only offering "more teacher pay and benefits" as a solution.  With the entire Democratic Party in the union's pocket and every major city under Democrat control school reform might simply be impossible outside of 'right to work' states.   * Money  Local taxes are the largest source of school funding at 44% (state 43%, national 13%).  This puts poor districts at a severe disadvantage as they lack the tax base and have expenses other districts do not have.  On the other hand, Washington DC spends the most per student by far at $25,000 a year and ranks only above Detroit in student performance.  More money is not the silver bullet, but insufficient funding and large class sizes are a large problem.  In summary, many solutions also create new problems and are less effective than expected, there is immense institutional resistance to reform, and most reform ideas completely ignore the most needy children. nan nan nan I know everyone probably wants to talk about the current election and shake up. But I'll keep pumping out some discussions unrelated to it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaFAnSKHNgsShort video by Ben Shapiro who states that you should speak in the language of morality, or more importantly speak their language. This will provide a rude awakening to them about their positions.----He makes a few statements of fact.1. The left is totalitarian. Is this an exaggeration? I recently read that the left has convinced people that tyranny is actually liberty. As in the government stepping in to control the internet is actually freeing people and giving them liberty. As in that don't realize what "rights" mean in regards to governments and force. Apparently forcing one group to do what another group wants is a form of liberty. The founders may have called this "Tyranny of the majority" except the left is not a majority and they aren't even using a democratic process in order to implement their tyranny.2. Efficiency arguments will win over nearly no one to your cause. Shapiro uses the example of Obama admitting that Capital Gain's taxes are bad for the economy and everyone in our country, yet he would still pursue them as it would be "fair". We conservatives see this as lunacy, yet there are more Americans that accept that argument than an efficiency argument. I would also make the case that logical arguments are also bound to fail if people don't care about efficiency. If this is true, the United States is in a very sad state.3. The left has effectively projected its weaknesses and evils onto Conservatives. Racism? Failed schools? Criminal violence? This may tie back into points 1 and 2: failure to use moral and emotional arguments. Blacks think conservatives are racist because they "don't care" about their plight. Conservatives don't care about human "life" because they are against taxing people to pay for more government programs to "help" (aka the so called compassion of the left, that it is anything but compassion). Conservatives support immoral violence because they won't allow "reasonable, common sense, restrictions" on guns. Problems that were started by democrats and maintained by Democrats they can project under Republicans and our efficiency arguments convince every day Americans that this is true.4. 80% of Americans thought that Romney cared less about them than Obama in 2012 exit polls. That Obama and Democrats admitted that they were ineffectual on a lot of fronts, and that they were *deeply* sorry and really wanted to make things work. It was okay that Obama was incompetent, because he cared and he was "trying". I have seen other polls similar to the one Shapiro mentions here regarding young people that nails this sentiment to a T. They admitted Obama had been bad for them as a demographic, but they still overwhelmingly voted for him because he was "trying". If that doesn't put a nail in the effectual arguments from conservatives I'm not sure what does. That is an incredibly scary reality that we have entered into. It no longer matters what you do and the consequences of your actions, as long as you "intended" to do good.5. The average American (especially young) doesn't have the time to read the entire editorial page in the WSJ. They have the attention span of 5 seconds. The ideas from the left are: "Horrible evil ideas, that went completely right in X country", "Immoral", "Evil", "*Unfair*", "Discriminatory", "Violation of the 10 commandments" (basic appeal to religion that the vast majority of support Americans are religious and would understand the fundamental evil that is the left). If you're unable to make them feel good about being conservative (which you should try) you can make them feel *really* bad at being a leftist.----So this discussion seems to tap onto a few of my previous posts: Controlling the Language, Character Attacks, and Emotional Arguments. I've gotten quite a bit of push back on the character attacks aspect of this, as clearly we all know it to be wrong. But at the same time it is used against us relentlessly. Should we stop giving the left the benefit of the doubt? We have been doing it for decades and they keep shitting all over us and we are losing control of the message. Either we fight back or have a strong way of destroying their vehicle of hatred. I'm happy to have been introduced to this sub!I, like many other reddit conservatives, have found my voice increasingly silenced  for speaking conservatively. I know that many of you have experienced similar things, but we remain a small group in this sub.The big conservative sub has 65,000 members, surely there are others who would like to join us in conservative thought and conversation; without having a tightly controlled propaganda-type narrative pushed by moderators. Discussion in that sub has gone from active, and sometimes heated, to entirely stagnant and almost non-existent in just a matter of months.While I'm sure there are some who are just burned out of political discussion (who doesn't feel that way?) I imagine the majority of those have gone quiet because of the moderation (not to be confused with the moderates) in that sub.What can we do about it? I'd propose an handful of ideas:1. Actively, but quietly, recruit conservative commentators on the other so called conservative subs by PMing them, inviting them to the discussions here.2. Actively, and less quietly, advertise this sub on the other so called conservative subs by commenting links to this one (this would need to be done by those who, unlike me, have not been banned in those subs)3. A meta post inviting others to this sub inside the so called conservative subs (I'm not sure what that would look like... would those ban-happy mods accept such a challenge to their power?)So the discussion and question is this: since a base tenet of conservatism is that of "more voices, not fewer," "more speech not less," how do we.... for a lack of better word... *proselytize* this sub? How do we grow this sub? How do we increase the *actual* conservative discussion on Reddit?  nan This statement, wherein [Trump threatens to break up the media conglomerates that cover him unfavorably](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/statement-on-monopoly-power-of-new-media-conglomerates) brings up an interesting general topic.  What should the government's role be in Trust-Busting?  Does it do too little?  Too much?  Which institutions should fall under this system of control, if any?  I imagine we will have a lot of disagreement over this one even among conservatives. What do you believe are the Constitutional Limitations, if any, of religious beliefs/dogma propagating into the public sphere or the government itself? Do those limitations actually apply to the states? Let's say a state decided that evolution would not be taught, the bible would be taught, and daily prayers would be held at public schools; ignoring the court precedent, do you find this a violation of the Constitution? ----1st Amendment of the Constitution:>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment14th Amendment, Section 1:>All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. **No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law**; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxivJefferson's letter that the Supreme Court used to build its current precedent under the bigoted KKK Justice Black (who hated Catholics with a passion):>To messers. Nehemiah Dodge, Ephraim Robbins, & Stephen S. Nelson, a committee of the Danbury Baptist association in the state of Connecticut.>Gentlemen the affectionate sentiments of esteem and approbation which you are so good as to express towards me, on behalf of the Danbury Baptist association, give me the highest satisfaction. my duties dictate a faithful and zealous pursuit of the interests of my constituents, & in proportion as they are persuaded of my fidelity to those duties, the discharge of them becomes more and more pleasing.>Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, & not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should "make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," thus building a **wall of separation between Church & State**. Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties.>I reciprocate your kind prayers for the protection & blessing of the common father and creator of man, and tender you for yourselves & your religious association, assurances of my high respect & esteem.>Th Jefferson**Jan. 1. 1802**.Emphasis on the date, as this was not an opinion declared during the Constitutional convention, but a long time after. Yet this is the legal precedent on which the court has based its opinion off of due to Justice Black.----I'll let others respond first and then share my full opinion. I imagine you can deduce what I think based on my links above. The federalist papers have a lot to say on this, feel free to tap into those in making your arguments. Though remember that the federalists papers were the opinions of only a few of the members of the Constitutional convention; and there were many disagreements among the delegates. So the opinions of a single individual does not dictate law. Multinationals currently hold $2.6 trillion dollars in profits made overseas which will never be invested in the United States because of our preventative corporate repatriation tax rate of 35%.Let's try to put that 35% into perspective. A multinational earns $100 in profit in Ireland.  Their goal is to turn that $100 into $110.  If they reinvest that $100 in Ireland they will hit their goal if they can make a profit of 10%.  However, if they invest that money in the USA they must first pay a tax of 35%.  This leaves them only $65 to invest.  In order to hit their $110 goal they must hit a profit of 69.2%.This tax policy is insane.  We *want* multinationals to invest their money in the USA.  Investment creates jobs and spurs economic growth.  There would be far greater tax revenues off of employee income tax alone than is currently collected from the corporate repatriation tax.Most other countries simply exempt the foreign-source income of their multinationals.  If the United States wishes to compete in the global market then we need to do the same. nan [Brennan created a task force](https://trendingpolitics.com/report-former-cia-analyst-says-brennan-created-secret-task-force-to-destroy-trump/?utm_source=star&utm_medium=twitter) As conservatives we know that price based economies are the most efficient/effective distribution of scarce resources that humans have invented.What are areas of our lives/country where price based economics just doesn't make sense? How is the scarcity resolved? Here are some examples:FamiliesMilitary UnitsMonopoliesReligious InstitutionsTry to take a good stab at it. We know there are areas of our economy like Healthcare that completely lack pricing, perhaps there is good reason for it? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8gqHnCB3QgCaught a clip of Tucker agreeing with Bernie Sanders on corporations and the richest abusing our welfare programs to supplement their employees. It almost sounded leftist. What are your thoughts?It does seem that the super rich in this country are sliding further and further to the left. Why is that? Is it because they know more regulation and higher income taxes make economic mobility harder, thus they are safe at the top?If we look at some of the biggest corporations from Tech, Banking, Investment, Retail, etc they seem to be loaded with leftists. nan I haven't read through the opinions of the recent 5v4 opinion that rule that public unions cannot be forced onto employees of the state as it violates their freedom of speech.Is this a stretch in terms of interpreting the first amendment? Precedent dictates that money = speech \*in politics\*. As your ability to spread your opinion via press or speech is directly related to the money you spend doing so. So you couldn't pass a law that states "No one can spend money on printing opinions contrary to Republicans". Clearly that subverts the meaning of "freedom of press" by claiming you are restricting money not the actual press.The court seems to be suggesting here that since Public Unions are obviously and blatantly political entities a law that forces you to give your money to them violates the first amendment. This also seems to go along the lines of a "Freedom of Association" which is not a Constitutionally protected freedom but falls into that vein.\----What are your thoughts on this ruling? I haven't had the time to read the majority opinion so maybe that has a better clarity on why they decided this. As a California Conservative this is big news as Public Unions have had this state bought and paid for. As conservatives we believe (and the data suggests) markets are the best economic model in which to exchange goods and to get the most innovation out of our society.But there comes a point where the most immoral person in the room will and can win out. George Soros being an example of that. But in pure theory it makes sense.If there are no checks on a market; the players with the least moral limitations are the ones with the most advantages in terms of beating out their competition (who are limited). Now you might say the consumers would stop buying from the immoral player. That assumes that 1.) People pay attention enough to such behavior 2.) That the immoral person isn't smart enough to pay attention to what people back lash against and avoid that.That begs to question that if such a system in indeed the best mechanism of moving capital and driving us to a better society; what checks do we put on it? The left would scream "Government" because that is their answer to everything. And the government can play a role to a certain degree here.----How does a society thrive using a free market system? What is the best way to gain the benefits from it without allowing the worse actors to climb to the top? nan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mRnbB12YFYMatt Walsh talks about higher education and the inherent problems with sending our children there. One aspect of his rant that I found interesting was the concept that education cannot be unbiased. Not that it's impossible for an educator to be unbiased; but that the very nature of educating has a world view associated with it.His argument is we are sending our children to Universities that are teaching world views opposite to our own. Deconstructing our children and brainwashing them with a new world view and this is incredibly harmful to the children and our society as a whole. Our goals should be to ensure our children are going to good universities; and these bad universities have no incentive to change their ways as we keep giving them money and sending our children to them.He makes the case that we have sacrificed our moral standards and principles because we have allowed ourselves to be dictated by a perceived economic need (which is dismisses early in the video) of our children having a diploma from higher education. Essentially for them to compete and be successful they must going through the indoctrination of an opposing world view. Do leftists have to send their children into schools that challenge their children's world view? Yes there are some of us that come out of the system well-grounded and stronger for it; but for every one of us there are likely 2 that get washed away in the hateful manipulative tactics of the left.I think Matt here misses some aspect of this. The problems are rooted far deeper than higher education; and are found throughout the education system itself. And parents have far and wide given up parenting and instilling these important moral values and principles. Not only that; choosing which college their kid goes to isn't always up to the parent. Yes the parent can refuse to pay for their kid to go to Fresno State due to the shit culture and educational standards there (world view). But that doesn't mean it will stop their child from going. He even makes the point that kids are swimming in debt to get these diplomas; which makes it clear many are not even being financially supported by their parents. I graduated in 2007 from college; I didn't receive a dime of money from my parents while in school. I supported myself, worked, fought for scholarships, and took out loans to get a degree where I could get a job. I even paid for my own SATs in high school so I could get into higher education (money I earned from summer jobs). So the extent of what parents can do in that regard is limited; but we as conservatives as a whole should be putting pressure on these universities to end this non-sense. Or to ensure there are enough conservative world view schools that new generations of students will have the options available to them to go to a principled and ethical institution. ----Higher education has become a requirement for many jobs in the United States (even if it isn't necessary at all). What can conservatives do to counteract this indoctrination of our youth with a world view that contradicts our own? Can education be unbiased? Or is all knowledge framed in a certain light/world view? How do we deal with a system where leftists out number conservatives 12 to 1 and hope to maintain an ethical and principled society? The left controls the gateway to knowledge (education), to careers (diplomas), to information (Media and Information Technology). How do we expect to ever have any shred of success against such odds stacked against our philosophical world view? The left has successfully pushed Christianity out of the public sphere (I'm agnostic; but this is apparent) through the bullshit of Separation of Church and State. Social conservatives are hated on by the left in an unfathomable amount of bigotry.  This is one of those issues where both sides seem to be making good points and I don't know what to think.  Does anyone have a better handle on the issue?I'm starting to think that tariffs will be somewhat disruptive, depending on the industry, but nobody has a clue whether that will be a good thing or a bad thing.Right now we have more than a $800,000,000,000.00 a year trade deficit.  If someone wants to explain how that's a good thing for the U.S. then I will politely ignore them, because there's no way that's a good thing.  Taking steps to reduce the trade deficit is a logical and urgent matter.The main issues with tariffs is that countries might retaliate and that they are paid by the consumer, so it's a cost of living increase to the people.When it comes to retaliation, [the U.S. currently has one of the lowest tariff rates](https://i.redditmedia.com/Lv6HAL4zX8gmK9dtRHOfMJiG6bbJO6tToOHxg970IJg.jpg?w=888&s=81f07022b82301cd6db388e22795ad19), so it could be argued that this is simply us retaliating.  The European Union currently has a 10% tariff on American cars while we only have a 2.5% tariff on cars.  Raising tariffs is completely justified in that case.  Chinese steel is heavily government subsidized.  We can't compete because they are undercutting the market.  Tariffs don't seem like an unreasonable response.But then when it comes to consumers paying the tariffs and prices going up it feels like it's all a giant shell game and there's no way for us to come out ahead. nan With the recent large pill we had to swallow in regards to the large deficit increasing budget; I've seen a lot of wailing about Republicans being no better than Democrats. This fails to realize this is a coalition and there are many issues we need to care about; the deficit being just one of them.What are your priorities for this Republican control government (keeping in mind the filibusterer still exists)? What do you hope they could achieve? How do you think Republicans can get enough democrats on board to avoid it being filibustered (reintroduce pork?)?Rank each of your priorities in terms of most important to least important (though you still care about it). Also note how well you think Republicans are doing on it. And how much better you think things are compared to a Democratic congress/presidency. We don't have to look that far back to remember the Obama years. nan nan nan nan Happy New Year! nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan A short one today.Are States binded to the United States with no recourse to leave? Does the clause that allows the adding of States also leave a method for States to leave the union? Were the Confederates rebels/traitors for attempting to leave the Union? Would those proposing CalExit be rebels/traitors? Feel free to talk about what's on your mind. Talk about what's on your mind. Open discussion. nan nan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0HKgs-0zDYPragerU touching up on one of my political projects on reddit; diversity. Shapiro has addressed these subjects as well and a few of my posts in the past covered Shapiro on this topic. There are three forms of diversity, and only one that is of actual positive use while the other two are either destructive or useless. Diversity of "Identity" (adds no value what to anything of note), Diversity of Value Systems (horrible, creates conflict and gives the impression of false equivalency between different value systems), Diversity of Thought (pivotal for a free thinking society, as different points of view help us to refine our own in order to make the best decisions).The left despises Diversity of Point of View or warps it into thinking diversity of identity somehow covers this (which it does not). They also greatly support Diversity of Values and Identity that are borderline bad to be out right horrible.----Ideally how should Universities function in regards to diversity? Is there a way for a University to promote diversity of thought? nan nan [ Henry Pelham's etching of the event that was widely distributed by Paul Revere.](http://i.imgur.com/wR8Di3V.jpg)Part of Revere's poem:*While faithless Preston and his savage Bands,  With murd'rous Rancour stretch their bloody Hands;  Like fierce Barbarians grinning o'er their Prey,  Approve the Carnage, and enjoy the Day.*  All thirteen colonies were enraged.  Some called it the first bloodshed of the revolution.  It was used as a rallying cry for rebellion for the next several years.  It was mostly revolutionary propaganda from the separatist group The Sons of Liberty (many of our favorite heroes).----The reality:Boston was a city of 20,000 with 4,000 British troops quartered to enforce the Townshend Acts.  It was a powder-keg in search of a light.A British sentry got into an argument with a local and struck him with the butt of his musket.  This drew a crowd which started to grow, get angry, and pelt him with snowballs.  He called for backup and the crowd eventually grew into a mob of over 300 which had the soldiers surrounded.  They were throwing ice, clubs, and stones while screaming insults, including taunting the British soldiers to fire.  It was quickly escalating into a riot.  One of the soldiers was knocked to the ground.  He stood up and fired his musket without being ordered.  The other soldiers then fired as well.  The incident was nothing like what was depicted in the famous engraving which was spread throughout the colonies.John Adams defended Captain Prescott and his men at trial.  Two of the soldiers were found guilty of manslaughter (not murder) and the Captain and the rest of his men were acquitted. nan nan Here is a portion of Ben Shapiro's show where he addresses Democratic tactics against Trump and Trump's tactics:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntsJ8yzmjvYI have noted this in previous culture war threads (that Shapiro brings up) that the Republicans have lacked an enemy to get Americans to unite around. Where Democrats are consistently painting the Republicans as their enemy. Shapiro here makes the case that Trump having lots of enemies is actually a very smart political strategy as the public can share in not liking a particular "enemy". Trump can attack the globalists (people on the left will like) and Trump can attack the media or bureaucrats (people on the right will like).Interestingly Shapiro says in this segment that the "Swiftboat Tactic" (constant hyperbolic attacks) used against Bush will not work against Trump. He points to the known quantities of the candidates. Bush had 40% approval with Democrats coming out of the 2004 election. This means part of his approval was the fact that he was a moderate and had support from both sides. Conservatives of course were not happy with what he did in his second term; but the Democrats should have loved him for it. The swiftboat tactics of the left didn't do a lot to dissuade Republicans (more so than they already were) but it killed Bush's support among Democrats.Trump on the other had is floating 3-5% approval among Democrats. A swiftboat type strategy by the media and Democrats isn't going to work; as Trump is a known quantity and you can't tank Democratic support of him anymore than it already is.----Is Ben correct that having lots of enemies that Americans can share with is a good political strategy for a Republican? And is that a sad state of our nation that it works? And are the media attacks on Trump going to be ineffective compared to what they did to Bush? nan What are her qualifications?  What makes her a good pick?Slash and burn on the budget is good,. But I think she is not a good pick.   Yes, I get break the union's but she has zero experience.Or am I wrong? nan nan nan nan nan nan After watching the Prager U video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JATJv8HlV8&t=0sI started thinking about one of my earlier posts on "terms" and how the left co-opts them. And it occurs to me that in the abortion debate we see a very perverse action by the left to claim "individual liberty" in their "pro-choice" argument. There is a very strong parallel to the Abolitionists vs. Slave Owners that carries over here. Unfortunately the left has co-opted "abolitionist" as a modern movement to end Capital Punishment so beyond this comparison I doubt we can use it much more.----Abolitionists saw a horrific sight occurring within their country; slavery. An institution where a human could be owned by another human and stripped of all rights and dignity. It was clearly evil in their eyes and needed to be ended. How would modern day slave owners who would exist on the left "defend" this evil immoral practice? 1. They would declare that the slaves weren't actually people. That their brains were less developed. That some arbitrary factor disqualifies them from the "rights" we would normally afford to individuals within our country.2. They would declare the abolitionists were declaring a war on the south (war on women) as it was a direct attack upon them and their ability to live their lives.3. They would declare that the abolitionists are anti-liberty because they opposed the choice of individuals in the South to do with their "property" (bodies) as they choose. 4. They would stack the Supreme Court with judicial activists to rule on cases like Dredd Scott to over ride the Northern state rights who found the practice offending.Number 1 being the first step any evil group does not harm another group of humans; dehumanize them. Number 2, create a form of victimization thus legitimizing any radical action they do to "protect" themselves. Number 2 also helps to bring in people who didn't necessarily have a strong opinion on slavery to suddenly feel like they were under attack (as in Southern culture was under attack); very similar to the War on Women tactic. Number 3 helps to provide a "moral" case for why the Abolitionists were evil and thus anti-American. Number 4 be the legal means in which they subvert the rule of law to impose their ideals.Number 3 was the one that really turned me onto this. The act of abortion is similarly abhorrent as the act of slavery (and oddly enough disproportionately affects blacks). The deflection to "liberty" argument of "Pro-Choice" is equally as absurd as the slave owners making a liberty argument... yet they do. If what they were doing wasn't offensive enough; they pervert liberty (a founding principle of our country) in order to deflect their horribly anti-liberty institution. This isn't surprising based on my previous culture posts reviewing this leftist tactic. They are masters of taking over words and misusing them in order to make their concepts more appealing to the masses. And this misuse of language is often just accepted by the right without much fuss.----What do you think of the comparison between Slave Owners and Pro-Abortion leftists? Is this going too far like comparing them to Nazis? Or are the similarities here pretty striking? As I have said on other topics, the left has not changed its tactics or methods only its targets. nan nan nan The recent crying by Democrats about Russia supposedly hacking them to swing the election towards Trump reminded me of Climategate in 2009. That was also supposedly a Russian hack that dumped their corruption and incompetence to the public. Leftists also ignored the contents of what was revealed in favor of screaming about the hacks.First it is wrong that they are using information hacked to influence our elections. But are they the only foreign entity that tried to influence the election? I would definitely say not.Second do you think the Russians did more than the hacks? There was a significant social media manipulation going on during the primaries that benefited Trump. Such tactics are typical of Democrats so I didn't think anything of it. Russia does have a history of infiltrating our social media to push their narrative in the form of propaganda.Do the ends justify the means? Or does the contents of what was leak out value the method and intent of how the contents were acquired? We now have evidence that moves the narrative from "conservatives stupidly think the media is biased" to "the media literally ran their questions and stories passed Hillary and the DNC for approval, making them a functional propaganda arm of their party".Should Republicans and Trump play the lefts game and denounce the means whike ignoring the contents (as the media is desperate to do)? Did Obama and Democrats denounce Harry Reid for standing in the floor of the Senate lying his ass off about Romney in order to help Obama win? Yes we show ourselves as more principled but at a serious political cost. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan Whoa, super controversial right? Do you mean the old way like before women could vote? Before blacks could vote? No, not at all.There was one concept I wanted to discuss though. I think we all believe requesting ID is a reasonable request when going to your polling place, it's not racist and any insinuation that it is is bogus, minorities are perfectly capable of getting an ID, and if it's cost issue, I'm okay with the state paying for it. But what if we went back to only letting property owners vote? Hang on, don't light your pitchforks and start trying to piece together exactly where I live yet.Just briefly what I like about the idea is that it requires us to work for our right instead of just being given some gift that so many people just squander. It also ensures you have a vested interest in the government not screwing with something you actually own. It naturally strengthens financial stability. There are so many ills that this would cure and we're past the limited rights that women and blacks had, so they could participate in this as easily as white men.Now obviously once you give people a right, taking it away is nearly impossible and I'm not advocating we do so or even propose this as a remote possibility, this is more of a thought experiment. But I tend to think that it's a good requirement, or if we amended it to require at least some ownership in a business of some kind... it doesn't take much money to buy a little stock, and even if you were part of some financial buying group where 100 people give 3 or 4 bucks, and go in on owning some stock together. This would not only ensure that people have a stake in what their votes do, it would be a way to engage them intellectually to see how finances work, which would ultimately strengthen the conservative view in their minds. Even if you only have a small stake in a company, that will change your view if the government wants to come in and start taxing the business in which you invested.Part of what ruined this country is a lack of real financial investment in it. That worked directly against Kennedy's belief that "It's not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country," which he may have been killed promoting.Ultimately my question here is how do we reestablish the people as being concretely, physically, financially tied the country? Right now we have many poor people who aren't even paying into the system, let alone investing in companies, is there away to stimulate that in poor areas? This would help ensure a more intelligent, informed citizenship. Can we create this as a trend somehow? Don't feel like putting together a high effort submission?  Simply want to share a quick thought on current events?  Do you have a strong opinion about Kit Kats vs. Snickers vs. Bit-O-Honey?  No longer feeling sorry for Cleveland about the Browns because of their success in the basketball and football?  Discover a new moisturizer people *need* to know about?  Confused on the difference between a joint resolution and a concurrent resolution?  Do you miss O'Grady's Au Gratin potato chips?This is the thread for you. nan The entire debate over a subject can be flipped on its head when one side can frame the narrative by using language incorrectly. For instance one may call Capital punishment "Murder" even though the very definition of "Murder" involves the *unlawful premeditated killing of one human by another*. But they do it with the intent of stoking the emotion, as everyone has it ingrained in them since they were young that murder is wrong.We have a problem with fundamental redefinition of words that our society is based on: Marriage, Rights, Liberty, Freedom, Capitalism, Equal Protection, Murder, Racism, etc. The left continuously misuses these terms to the point that it eventually gets accepted as a legitimate use of the word.This following article covers that aspect of the discussion:http://www.edmundburkeinstitute.org/OurGracefulHeritage/TheliberalabuseoftheEnglishlanguage.htmAnother aspect of the discussion that is hurting us in the culture war to win over the hearts of American is the ability of the left to Strawman conservatives and their arguments/positions: Trickle Down Economics anyone? They are also able to connect our positions to leftist failures throughout History: State Capitalism (there is even a wiki for this now). Even though Capitalism by its very definition makes it clear that the state is not involved, they have managed to label the failed communist states of the 20th century as "State Capitalism" I shit you not. State Capitalism being an oxymoron should amaze you that the left says this stuff with a straight face.This following article covers that aspect of this discussion:http://www.nationalreview.com/article/429804/liberal-political-language-conservativesFinally conservatives need to nail liberals on subjects like abortion when they are completely scientifically illiterate. This makes them look completely retarded, yet conservatives seem to avoid this. Yes the emotional argument is effective, but when you have liberals on live television contradicting biology text books you're missing an opportunity. Again like the misuse of "Murder" they do this for emotional reasons. In both issues they need to be held accountable for being illiterate (as they are both misusing a basic English word as well as contradicting science).----So the questions to you guys. Is what words have we allowed them to really hurt us with? Dominionist? Trickle down economics? Compassion?How do we combat this dominate control over the narrative that the left has managed setup? With their control over academia and the media is this even possible? [The Legislative Vesting Clause](http://www.heritage.org/constitution#!/articles/1/essays/2/legislative-vesting-clause) states; "*All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.*"The Supreme Court used to regularly strike down laws and regulations as unconstitutional if they disregarded the balance of power by delegating legislative authority to the executive branch.Lately the SC has moved away from the delegation issue allowing an unprecedented transfer of power from the legislative branch to the faceless bureaucracy of the executive branch.  Legislation through regulation is becoming the new norm. nan nan nan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lKNNaLut-gGood interview with Tucker Carlson; but the aspect that popped out is another conservative agreeing that inequality is a problem. I was watching a discussion on the Joe Rogan show between Jordan Peterson and another right leaning intellectual and they also brought this up. They stated that inequality is a problem because it causes instability within the system. As in higher chance of crime and violence. The left does nothing to address it (which is why inequality gets worse in left controlled areas like California or under the Obama administration) as their politics benefits from the inequality being emphasized.----Do you think this is true? I've read China has massive inequality and very little resultant crime because of it; is that just because of their Confucius culture? What should be done; if anything about inequality? Is economic mobility the key to making inequality meaningless? What are conservative solutions to this potential problem? Why does inequality seem to get worse in leftist controlled areas? nan nan nan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-58HoTHWQkI've done many posts on the past; nice to see Prager U get a video up on how important this is. Michael Knowles makes some great points that I have been making for years on semantics and how important it is.Let me know how you feel about the left's distortion of language. Leftists often use a false equivalency and claim that the "right" does it as well. This is often how they deflect the degenerate tactics that are wide spread employed by their side. Is this politics as usual? Or is there calculation and malice behind this cultural tactic? nan nan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of-YDDa7-qwThis segment Klavan addresses progressives' desire/need to have experts "rule" over the masses. This seems to be a spin off of "Centralized Planning". The idea that we have these really smart people making decisions for us. I mean they are the experts; of course they are going to know what is best? Right?Klavan argues that experts are only that in name. And to be true experts they need to be able to convince us of what they are doing before implementing it.Progressives have historically found the constitution as a hindrance to their goals. It's always in their way. It's not a necessary bedrock to our Republic; but a road block to all the great solutions they have for all of our problems. Klavan cites a few famous progressives of the last 100 years to show this.----I would add on to Klavan's case that progressives want the power far removed from the people. As in they directly oppose the decision making of the people of the United States. If they could have it their way they would turn over all our power to the United Nations. They envy the European Union and hate state and local rights. The further removed from the people; the more they support it.Again centralized planning. So is there a paradigm difference between the right and left on solving problems? The left see's a problem and only they can solve the problem because they "know" what is best for everyone else. This is why they distrust capitalism. How can goods and services be distributed in such a chaotic system? If only they were in charge of the distribution there would be no poor or homeless people!We all have dreams of grandeur of having ultimate power and authority; but the left actually perceives it as a politically viable path forward. They can't trust a system they can't control or fully understand. As such they can't truly trust individual freedom/liberty.----What are your thoughts on having a intellectual political nobility that rules over the masses? Assuming no corruption (which is almost a guarantee) what could go wrong with such a system? Populism seems to run rampant in our current system that breeds vast ignorance and political pandering. nan nan nan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM88wp03DNoA continuation of the previous topic. Where the left claims the opposition does not deserve a seat at the table. That Conservatives are not worth debating.----Polarization of the country is reaching extremes. Are there any topics in which the left will "talk" with conservatives? Or is 40% of the country effectively being told to shut up and stay home? Christian Conservatives have already faced this for the last 20+ years. Any politician who refuses to shut up about their religious beliefs is called a Dominionist and clearly wants a Theocracy. The hate they have been lambasting Vice President Pence will spread to other aspects of conservatism. This is bigotry. Why are conservatives and moderates unable to unwilling to call out the left for what they are doing? Do we think calling out bigoted actions is disrespectful and beneath us? How is staying silent on this good for America or for the conservative movement? It really is not. nan nan Follow up to the recent:https://www.reddit.com/r/ConservativeLounge/comments/7m9tob/what_makes_us_a_nation/What identities matter? The left has fabricated thousands of identities and claimed they are important and use them to divide us up. But are some identities important? - Profession?- Hobbies?- Sexual Fetishes?- Religions?- Political Parties or affiliations?- Racial ancestry?- Economic station?The list can go on and on. What identities are important and why? Let's take two behavior based identities:Gamer - Plays video games on a regular basis. Classified as a hobby; but maybe a major aspect of that person's day to day life.Homosexual - Likes to have sex with same gender. Classified as a sexual orientation; impacts life choices but may not dictate the day to day life of that individual.Both of the above are behaviors. Though the first one we don't really consider a serious identity; yet there is an entire culture built around gamers. They left has defined homosexuals as a specific identification; as in they are unique and homogeneous as a group. Why is a group of gamers not on the same level as homosexuals?Or let's add another behavior based identification: alcoholic. This one is treated more seriously than gamer and has a negative connotation to it. But do we think of alcoholics as a "group" or more of a behavioral problem? When thinking of alcoholics what do you think of?----Do the identities that leftists put up on pedestals deserve to be distinguished. Does a person who chooses homosexual behaviors deserved to be identified as a homosexual?What identities are important and why? We as conservative oppose the idea of government spending having a significant economic impact; while leftists oppose the idea that tax cuts have a significant economic impact.----As a thought experiment. What do you think the economic growth from government spending is? How about debt based spending (as in not funded by taxes taken out of the economy)?We see the deficit being reduced by cutting over all government spending. What percentage of every dollar cut will actually result in deficit reduction? As in the spending has a positive contribution to the economy of some form and the stop of that spending will shrink economic growth (thus leading to less revenue).We saw nearly a Trillion dollars worth of spending from Democrats in the early Obama years that had literally no impact on the economy. No signal what so ever. Was that just mismanaged? Are there proper ways for government spending to be effective? What makes us American? What makes us a people?In history this question was sometimes answered by a particular race. Though races were impossible to actually attribute as there was a lot of cross breeding between the various peoples across the globe. Then there was a particular culture and traditions associated with culture that defined a people. Languages spoke, food, music, religion, family, etc.In the 20th century we saw the rise of nations that identified by creed. We saw ourselves as the bastion of Democracy and freedom; a liberty creed. Then there was communism which focused on a collective creed; good of the many. Then there was the creed of the fascists which was the creed of the state.Then there is simply geography. If you live in a certain area you are a part of that nation. China fights for perception as they have a notion of what is "China" and those people are automatically a part of China.----If the United States is a nation formed from a creed. What is that? And with a particular political party in opposition to that; what does that mean? Is that creed laid out in the Constitution? If people oppose that Constitution and think it's an "out of date document" does that mean they reject the United States itself along with its people?And if we are not a people; what is the point of borders? Just to keep our economic advantage? nan nan nan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSAvK01EkDIStarting around 10 minutes. Andrew Klavan brings up an interesting discussion about two paradigms of morality. Though there is a gradient in-between.- Individual Morality. Individuals live by their own morality and act upon it. Thus they will determine what is right and wrong.- Rules Morality. Laws are setup to enforce the morality to ensure a continuity in society.Those are the two extremes, as one leads to a Tyrannical Order and the other leads to Anarchy and Chaos. What do you feel is the proper amount of "Rules Morality"? Is some morality situational? Certain moral positions are superior to others; but how do we ensure such positions rise to the top within society? nan nan Short post from me.I haven't followed the stories too close; but it appears as if Trump is pulling an Obama and legislating via executive orders. Am I wrong? How is this different? Does the ACA give leeway for the executive to do what he's doing?While we can appreciate the "ends" he is taking while Republicans can't be bothered to pull their heads out of their asses; we still believe in the rule of law and the end does not justify the means.----edit 10/14/17:Well this addresses one of those executive order quite well:http://www.nationalreview.com/article/452660/obamacare-subsidy-payments%3A-trump-illegal-subsidiesIn essence healthcare subsidies were never funded by congress. Obama penned them in via executive order adding onto his dozens of unconstitutional actions as president. Trump ending those payments is a correction.This still leaves opening up insurance markets across state lines. nan nan nan According to 2015 FBI statistics, there were 1,197,704 violent crimes and 7,993,631.  According to 2008 numbers there are 885,000 'sworn' full time officers in the US.  That averages out to 1.36 violent crimes and 9 property crimes per officer per year.  Should the same police officers responsible for criminal law enforcement be responsible for civil law enforcement?Does having police officers enforce the civil violations turn them into "bureaucrats with weapons"?---South Africa has National Traffic Police, basically glorified meter maids, with the power to issue tickets and hold people as needed until "the real police" show up.  They believe this reduces the tension between the public and the police and makes the public more willing to work with the police.In the UK, 90% of officers do not carry guns.  They believe armed officers send the wrong message to the public and puts the officers in the wrong frame of mind for civil servants.  In Ireland, their standard police force does not carry guns at all; they have special divisions with different uniforms for emergency response.  ---["The difference between a civil offense and a criminal offense are usually defined by the nature of the offense and the punishment assessed. Civil offenses involve violations of administrative matters."  "Whether the offense is civil or criminal in nature, it will be defined by a local, state, or federal statute. State and local statutes can vary greatly by state, county, and city."](https://criminal-law.freeadvice.com/criminal-law/criminal-law/civil_offense_crime.htm)The lack of clarity between civil offenses and criminal offenses is another issue worthy of discussion, especially due to the variances between jurisdictions. nan nan nan nan Freely discuss your thoughts or post some comments about your day.

Hansen is one of my favorite conservative intellectuals. Though I relate as I live in California, so the issues he touches on, are really close to home. Though I grew up in Northern California agricultural communities and have seen similar fallouts, though not to the same degree. Interesting video on the things Trump has done right. He skirts the things Trump has done wrong (briefly mentions the deficit). Near the end of the video he covers a topic I think Tucker Carlson is all about. Republicans play a game of extreme market driven outcomes, as in if the market deems you not worthy, you are not worthy. And this message is harsh, destructive, and pushes people away from the Republican party. Which is why we often are hard core against Tarrifs and are for globalism. But the negative impacts of such moves do indeed effect communities and in a destructive way. One of the messages I have been pushing for the past year or two, is that Conservatives are the only political group that care about individuals, communities, and the collective. Libertarians hyper-focus on the individual, leftists hyper focus on the collective. Meaning the communities have been left to decay and die. The Republican party, which is supposed to be the Conservative party has taken up positions that also ignore the communities which are a crucial part of what makes this country great. So what happens if there is an event or change in the economy or world economy that is having a direct and negative impact on one of our communities? They are the market ‚Äúlosers‚Äù. Should anything be done? Especially since often times this doesn‚Äôt happen in a vacuum, international trade, foreign nations subsidizing agricultural goods, etc could result in why this market is no longer competitive (or draconian environmental laws passed by Democrats that kill the logging industries or coal industries). What role should we take in terms of helping preserve the communities? Trump‚Äôs answer was tariffs and bullying companies that prioritized their bottom line over the American lives and communities it impacted. Democrats answer was welfare and has always been this. Put those ‚Äúlosers‚Äù on the government dole and move on. Republicans? Get over it and move on? This seems like a pretty big disconnect given communities are a core aspect of the conservative value system. Conservatism is a balance between many factors. In recent years we have allowed our market driven priorities to supersede and imbalance our society. This is why there are numerous Republicans who have no issue with illegal immigration or mass immigration. As in the end they lowers the price of labor, allowing more good and plentiful resources in which to utilize. Have conservative elites/intellectuals failed to grasp key aspects of what made conservatism important, relevant, and relatable? --- The video is quite good and I recommend it. My topic above is only a small portion of the video that I extrapolated on. But I think it‚Äôs a flaw that Republicans/Conservatives need to come into balance on. Tucker Carlson has made this a driving issue for him, as has Trump. We have struggling communities, often times due to Democratic corruption and evil, but Republicans seem to take no interest in them. We are only as strong as the weakest link within our communities and allowing them to fail and live in squalor will result in larger and larger problems for our society as a whole. We joke about Chicago and San Francisco, or mourn the Appalachian Mountain communities. Yet we show no interest in actually helping them. And yes to a certain degree this is ‚ÄúVirtual Signaling‚Äù as in, showing emotional interest. But there should be a concerted effort to actually help. Not generalized people, but actual communities. You help your neighbor now, they will be there to help you in the future. We should want them to be successful, even if they made their own beds (as in continued to vote for Democrats for decades on end). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noj4phMT9OESummary: Darwinism is good for minor observable changes in life. Fur, beaks, etc. He completely fails to explain (which is what his theory purports to explain) the emergence of new life.Interesting video discussing the problems with Darwin‚Äôs theory of evolution (as he wrote it). The challenge comes from the perspective of Einstein debunking aspects of Newton, not a complete dismantling of the theory. The idea is that Darwin‚Äôs theory was correct based on the science and information available for his time, but modern science is showing fundamental problems with the theory that the fossil record is demonstrating.Interesting video, and I only post it due to the dogmatic nature in which the The Theory of Evolution is upheld by the left. I am not a biologist, but I tended to agree it was the best theory available showing how new life emerges, but I also understood the theory had new updates or new contradictions nearly every decade. Thus those who attack people like Dr. Ben Carson for not buying into Evolution as blasphemous really need to chill. The theory exists as a means to understand and to predict the future, not as a tool to punish heretics. Especially since this knowledge has nearly no relevancy to 99.9999999% of all society or science. ---The argument starts with the short period of time in the Cambrian Explosion nearly .5 billion years ago, it is impossible to explain based on Darwin‚Äôs theory. As in its incorrect or not complete. The modern concept of an animal came from that period, and there were no previous stages of creatures in which you could see them slowly coming about. They argue these sudden new life forms come from proteins, or new protein creations that build the framework for new life.Their mathematical problem is about protein creation from amino acids. Having useful proteins coming about by random chance is ‚Äúexceedingly rare‚Äù. As each new amino acid is an exponential growth in combinations. Functional to non-functional ratio 1/10^77. This is also the problem evolution has had with explaining the origin of life (not covered in this video). That amino acids just so happened managed to arrange themselves to allow life to occur, they are now in the same fundamental problem explaining the Cambrian Explosion, as just so happens useful proteins all started to show up within a 10-70 million year period. Which may seem like a long time, but is nothing compared to the above ratio. 10,000,000 years is only 10^6. They state that the calculated number of organisms to have ever existed (even long extinct) is 10^40. That includes every living entity on Earth to have ever existed. Even if they were all alive at the same time and existed for the entire period, it would still be near impossible for any of them to have actually found a useful protein by Darwin‚Äôs Theory in that time frame.They of course don‚Äôt blame Darwin. They see it as their jobs as scientists to question and challenge theories/guess‚Äôs/assumptions of previous scientists.I find it interesting how much computer science applies to molecular science. As in there is a coding that occurs, with discrete symbols that are not based on chemical reactions. One of the three scientists argues for Intelligent Design (he‚Äôs the biologists name Meyer, the other two do not), his argument is it provides an explanation for organized data. As in all other instances of organized data come from an intelligent source. He does not make any cases towards a god or higher power, but that the development of new organisms seems to correlate to a design.Berlinkski (Philosopher) says he doesn‚Äôt see intelligence, just information. Fairly agnostic. Gelenter (Computer Scientist) states he see‚Äôs a mess where ever he looks, and it‚Äôs a pretty terrible design if there was intelligence behind it. All from failed creatures, the human mind, and society in general. Though he presumes he would be intelligent enough to understand the design or its *intent*.Very absurd point made by two philosophers, brought up in this video, is that the universe was not worth it. As in they believe that existence was a failure and the suffering is too great. As in suffering is the only metric in which to judge existence. Pretty astounding conclusion. Though I read in the comment section that this was a misunderstanding of their arguments, that it was purely the human element. As in humans choosing the material plane were making a bad choice over the spiritual one.The supporter of Intelligent Design invokes theological to address the failures/suffering (and he admits it) that the intelligent design shows the origins, but not the outcome. As in there is a ‚Äúdecay‚Äù to the design. An entropy. He states that the mutations that Darwin built his theory on is not an explanation of how new life forms come about, but how the design decays (as these are small changes). I find this fascinating. From a theological perspective they state this fits perfectly within the Judeo-Christian philosophy. That good is the creation, evil subverts or destroys that creation (I‚Äôm paraphrasing horribly as I don‚Äôt understand it that well, I‚Äôm agnostic).The Computer Scientists who doesn‚Äôt agree with the intelligent design, does refer to the rampant and blatant bigotry in academia against it. He says the scientific question is a valid one, and it should be intellectually explored. Instead there are many who dismiss it out of hand without even considering it. He also calls out that large swathes of the world of science are ideologically bent. As in their politics or preconceived notions override good science (as in question everything and attempt an understanding).Darwinism is called out as a crutch for a replacement for religion. Which explains the dogmatic approach many on the the left lean on it. It‚Äôs one thing to state ‚Äúhey this does a good job framing the emergence of new life and the changes we see between species‚Äù, and ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt believe in evolution you are an absolute idiot and should never hold any job of importance from politics to being a doctor without accepting it.‚Äù The left heavily falls in the ladder mindset (they also do this for Global Warming discussions).This is probably a whole different discussion, but people used to search for the ‚Äútruth‚Äù through the divine. Thus the dogmatic positions within religion and the conflicts that came from them. Now they search for ‚Äútruth‚Äù through science. Science is a means of understanding, not necessarily the truth. That‚Äôs kind of a weird statement to make, but I feel our resources and capabilities are far from being able to determine certain truths. We can get a good understanding enough that we can act in certain ways, but a full and complete understanding is unlikely any time soon. But I guess this turns into a philosophical argument of facts and truth, and is divergent from this video.They have a philosophical discussion about the origin of minds and if they are important. As in the ability to think has no value within the spectrum of Darwinism. And that science itself has no value from such a perspective. I didn‚Äôt follow this part too closely, so I would recommend watching it as I might have butchered their discussion.They move on to discuss whether they think Darwin will go the way of Karl Marx and Freud. They all agree Marx was a windbag and is dead wrong on all accounts. They disagreed that Freud is going anywhere (that the only issue was feminists angry at some of his comments, not about his larger theories). Meyer (one that proposes intelligent design) argues that these three individuals make up the religion of the left. Marxism tells them where we are going, Darwin tells them where we came from, Freud tells them who they are. It‚Äôs the three planks used to replace the Judeo-Christian foundation.I would remark that if this is the case, it shows why they are so desperate to cling to Marx after he has long been debunked. It also shows why Post Modernism was so necessary, as a fundamental aspect of their ‚Äúreligion‚Äù was proven false. Either they need to find a replacement (which they can‚Äôt) or they have to pretend as if it wasn‚Äôt proven false by undermining the methods (facts and history) that show it to be the case.They finish with how will Darwinism finally be put to bed? Best out come? Old guard dies and a new generation moves on. This happened in nutritional sciences. We were told ‚ÄúFats‚Äù were bad and you wanted to avoid them for decades. Once the old guard died off, we find out that this isn‚Äôt really the case. Gelernter (Computer Scientist) states that isn‚Äôt likely to happen as this ‚Äúreligion‚Äù is passed on to each new generation unquestionably. They don‚Äôt actually explore how they think this theory will be over turned, as they probably have no idea. The fact that is religiously observed and dogmatic means it might not go away any time soon even if it is dead wrong on the big picture of origin of species.All agree Darwin will not be going away any time soon. He will be like Newton (though more wrong in their assessment) and will live on even if his theory is understood as debunked. The new theories that go onto replace it will be related to Darwin as a means of materialistically categorizing life and organisms.---I have to say Berlinski just annoyed me. He was definitely a contrarian, which is funny on occasion. But he does little to substantiate his own positions. I guess that‚Äôs the nature of philosophers.I think I was convinced. I‚Äôve always supported evolution as far as it‚Äôs the best explanation, but I have never felt it provided a satisfactory explanation to the question. I think Berlinkski‚Äôs final remarks were probably correct, it‚Äôs a premature question. We do not have enough information even today to satisfactory come up with an explanation, Darwin in the 19th century definitely did not.One thing that was failed to be address here is an alternative theory. - Standing theory: Random chance of mutations in proteins and amino‚Äôs to give new functional change in organisms.The opposite of completely random (as the Darwinists claim) is intelligent design. As in emergence of new life was intentionally created. This was the position Meyer supports. The other two while they agreed Darwin was dead wrong on the big picture, did not have an alternative theory to replace it. Science even when dealing with bad theories requires a new theory in order to replace it. Intelligent Design has a set bigotry against it (due to religious connections) thus they will happily support Darwinism even when it is clear it does not work.Either the bigotry needs to be addressed or an alternative theory will need to be created to compete with Darwin to categorize life and how it emerges. The problem with intelligent design is it's a dead end question that adds even more questions that can never be answered. As in if someone designed the new life forms, who designed them? Where did they come from? Etc. It goes down a metaphysical hole where science tends to avoid. Though there are certain areas of science which are in that ball park (cough cough, string theory).I have to say my inner geek comes out from hearing this. As I had long felt based on Darwin‚Äôs theory that evolving was a very mundane process. But this discussion makes me think that vast possibilities exist and that the ‚Äúright‚Äù protein combinations haven‚Äôt emerged yet. Though it could take hundreds of millions of more years before the next phase begins. Or we may just engineer it in the next few centuries :) .---What are your thoughts on the dogmatic take of Evolution? Why does the left seem to care so much about it in every aspect of life? In reality not believing in evolution would only effect a Evolutionary Biologist. Not even a every day biologist would be impacted in their work if they didn't believe in evolution. Is this really one of their three planks to a secular religion? Has Climate Change doom and gloom replaced Marxism for their notion of the "future" (as religions typically have)?Finally since those in academia are entirely entrenched on the dogmatic nature of the subject, what do you think it will take for them to accept a competing theory? I have a feeling that the question of the Cambrian Explosion may actually be the same question of the Origin of Life. As in the answer to one, is the answer to the other. There is some element we are missing that is causing vast biological changes. Perhaps something with the sun? Some other forcing that results in a change. Feel free to talk about anything here. Low effort posts are allowed. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7zdQ-7g0aULooks like the old Hillary complaint is becoming more main stream on the left. The obvious goal here is to tie conservatives to "alt-right" figures, as that will allow them to call people like Shapiro racist.Do you think this will gain traction on the left? They have done crazier things before. nan Been a while since I've updated this. I hope everyone is doing well. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5J-zL0RRtkFirst three topics below. His other topics were interesting; but not as political. 4th topic being suicide rates at a 30 year high in the United States.First portion covers the left using social media to suppress conservative voices and news feeds. Facebook has suppressed conservative news feeds from anywhere to 10-25% via their algorithms, and equivalent news sources on the left received a near equal bump in traffics. Nearly 50% of all Americans receive their news from Facebook. Throw is google fact checking only conservative sites; shifting their algorithms, their banning of conservatives on YouTube.Throw in Twitter doing the same. And the left has expanded its bigotry from the once free exchange of ideas University Campuses to Social Media (which was also supposed to be neutral ground).Shapiro's only solution to this is that "competitors will arise". We can only hope. But this doesn't sound like a solution; but a hope.----Second topic was VP Pence's daughter's book that is being targeted by the left for harassment. Though I have seen a wide spread demonization of Pence in recent months that is too coordinated for it to be a coincidence. Left wing talking point bots have spread the word and the useful idiots have picked them up and are running with them. Apparently Pence needs to be destroyed.I saw something very similar happen during the GOP primaries; when the left saw Cruz had a potential to win they began fabricating non-sense and scare stories about him and his positions. The same made up word "Dominionist" is being rolled out for Pence now. Apparently if you are a unabashed Christian in politics; you now want a Theocracy.Pence apparently hates women and gay people according to the left. Because in their identity politics; if you don't support their politics you must hate the identity group they pretend to be supporting with it. Which by the way means if you're Christian; you are by default a target to be hated on. That is the bigotry of the left. It is not enough that we disagree; they have to destroy your life and that of your children. These are the same people who harassed Pence and his family because he dared to watch a play on Broadway. He wasn't there in any political capacity; yet they harassed him and his family who were non-political.This tactic by the left is not necessarily new. They did the same thing to Sarah Palin. Apparently anyone who is a social conservative is to be targeted and destroyed in all capacities of life. Her daughter was openly ridiculed by disgusting jokes by David Letterman. Why? Because Sarah Palin was a social conservative so making fun of her children was free game.Shapiro makes the excellent point that a shitty *political* book Chelsea Clinton meant to brainwash children was left unmolested by conservatives.----Third topic is a transition from the previous topic; which is that the left always projects bad motives onto us for disagreeing with their politics. It's not that we disagree; it's that we are bitches of the NRA. Or we are racists. Or Fascists. We hate poor people. We hate women.The list goes on and on. Shapiro addresses a letter where the student literally fabricates fake news and presents it as fact; and then attempts to demonize Shapiro based on guilt of association with these strawman "supporters" of his. And then tells him that he needs to change his political positions because these strawmen bad players support him. In the typical reddit left wing troll fashion; the writer of the letter pretends to be a Republican and from a Republican family and only wants the extremism of Shapiro to be reigned in...This is typical of the left; as they are unable to actually make arguments in support of their own positions much less make arguments deconstructing conservative positions. Instead they must fabricate "evil" intent and actions and claim the right has committed them. Like every single mass shooter is automatically assumed to be "right wing". Or how they claim most "violence" has been right wing in the last 20 years; yet they label any racial element, anti-government element as "right wing". Essentially because they associate evil with the right; that means any evil much be of the right. Circular logic from such simple minded emotional tools.----In terms of social media conservatives have been doing exceptionally well on Twitch and Facebook even though the corporations are far left in nature until recently. These new moves by them seem to be cracking down significantly on conservatives abilities to voice their message (which is the only way leftist thought can actually win out; with no competition). nan nan nan Michael Knowles show last week did a interesting review of voting and who should be voting:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-SJN1xLEv0Democrats are effectively pushing voting among populations 100% to bolster their political power with no regard to our system of government or the ethics of it. Felons, Felons on Parole, Foreign Nationals, Illegals, children.The question comes to the point of: "Who should be voting?" Democrats have been saying for the last decade that the more people who vote the better. Why? They act as if there is some inherent value in ignorant people voting. Do they benefit from large scale ignorant voting? (I would suggest they do).During the time of our founding the States determined who could vote as it wasn't a right of the Republic. Though based on the writings of the founders they perceived direct Democracy has a horrific system; they also did not trust the masses to vote. Those who were allowed to vote by the States were the male land owners of the time. The logic being that they were 1.) Informed 2.) had an ongoing stake in the success of the country as a whole 3.) They or their sons would fight in militias and were willing to die for their country as citizen soldiers. The male aspect was based on the culture of the time; as politics was perceived to be a masculine activity along with war. But there were clear limitations on voting to ensure that those who voted were of a certain caliber and interest in the success of the nation as a whole.The voting age was pushed down to 18 during 1971; mostly with the logic that if a man can be drafted to fight and die for his country he should also have the recourse to vote. It follows the logic that was around at the founding; except it only limited the criteria to one aspect. It also doesn't make sense for women who are not subject to the draft yet will still be voting at the age of 18. Essentially rights without the responsibility. ----Are rights contingent on responsibility? It would seem as if our society whole heartedly endorses that from the inception or our nation as the Justice System has always had the power to strip rights away misbehavior. That seems to suggest those who have rights expected some form of responsibility.Do we lack that now? Seems to make sense for certain rights. Does it makes sense for 1st amendment rights?The right to vote like many things has been misrepresented to the population at large by the masses. Both political parties benefit from such a populace system of voting; but even if Republicans opposed it in principle how would they even express it without being called fascists?Using the video's hyperbole; if voting is so important where do we stop it? Babies? Foreign nationals living here? Let the whole world vote in our elections? I mean if the more people that vote makes it better; why would we limit anyone from voting? Why is it important that a felon vote? Why is it important that a 16 year old vote who's brain won't fully develop for another 9 years and who is far from educated? Why is it important to allow a foreign national who has no loyalty to the United States or its people to vote in our elections?Democrats can't or won't answer these questions; they propose that the act of voting is innately good and will not engage in intellectual discourse on these questions. The reason they will not engage in these questions is they know the answers; it is bad. The only rational explanation for their push is more political power. The parties serve themselves; not the American people. Whatever gains them more political power is their motivation.----Political parties are important for coalitions of political ideologies to formulate into ruling governments. But have we spawned creatures that will actively subvert and destroy our nation at the same time? They exist to accumulate as much power as possible; which is necessary for political reform; but they seem to exist to gather that political power for the sake of having it.----Quite a few topics. Feel free to jump on any of them as this is a stream of consciousness. What should be the scope of voting within our Republic? Do we no longer demand responsibility from those who exercise their rights? Are the political powers that be actively subverting our country to further their goal of gaining power? nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan There is a Model U.S. Gov sub here on Reddit.

I never understood this though and was hoping someone could explain it to me. I know that Reagan is often touted as the conservative superman or whatnot. But why wear a shirt for a man you weren't even alive to see in office? I've never seen someone wearing a shirt for any other older campaign (democratic or republican). Is there something unique about this campaign in how it resonates with today's generation of college republicans? We're always looking for Republicans with good ideas to join us.

In their view, neocons have failed to conserve anything and only care about protecting Israel and helping the rich. The main positions of the Groypers were putting America first, ending mass immigration, and defending Christianity. Their unofficial leader was Nick Fuentes, an American nationalist youtuber.I say all of this in the past tense because the Groyper War has more or less come to an end but these young nationalists are still out there and could (and likely will) confront establishment conservatives in the future. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan Dear /r/CollegeRepublicans,We at /r/ModelUSGov are currently having our Midterm elections.

Full disclosure - I'm a democrat-leaning independent whose been out of college for several years.You did the right thing by attending.

Now I know not everyone is happy about Trump being our president but hell. Trump won fair and square and everyone is freaking out claiming that he cheated. Now when Obama won did the republicans freek out and cause protests hell no. But when the liberal babies do not get who then want which was first Bernie. I relate all this to a mother and a baby in a grocery store. The baby is crying and making a scene because he wants candy. When the mother gives him candy to shut him up he learns that when he is in trouble he can make a scene and not get in trouble. The Liberals are the baby. And since they do not have who they want for president they take it apon  themselves to  disobey school rules just because their choice did not win. In actuality it Coliin Kapernick never did it.

I pointed out how damaging it can be for children. I pointed out:\- How will children know that they are male or female if you delude them that there is no gender?\- You cannot hide children from the biological reality that they are either born male or female.\- Raising children gender neutrally will only confuse them more. And you are messing with their development. There was also more that I discussed; and the class got so heated. There was also a student who identified as They/Them told me that my project was offensive. So apparently I was being offensive for telling the truth. They also accused me of being transphobic; even though I stated that Theybies might undermine those who really do suffer from Gender Dysphoria.

Subsequently I've gotten into podcasts to try and keep up with what all is happening with our new administration. In my head I'm a Republican although I've never registered as such but I try and listen to the more left leaning podcasts like Keepin' it 1600, now known as Pod Save America, and the mostly unbiased NPR politics in order to try and hear both sides of the story. My dilemma is that I've yet to find a quality conservative Republican podcast except for maybe Meet the Press and I haven't much liked that one. Anyone know of a solid, relevant, maybe even funny Republican podcasts out there? nan nan nan nan nan nan Im just curious, I'm a libertarian esque conservative. I personally dislike that "my party" opposes social issues as I believe the govt should generally get out of a persons business on a general basis. I think in the past 20 years the country has grown ever more accepting, albeit very slowly. It angers me that in politics we oppose issues we may consider valid, merely because an opposing party embraces said issue. That is an unfortunate side effect of politics that we should find a way to work past.I didn't always agree with his decisions, in fact I disagreed with over 50% of what I heard come out of his mouth. I happen to think he allowed us to be pushed around on the world stage, and allow large intl companies to run roughshod over the average person (and small to medium sized businesses which are the backbone of our country.)if you take the last 8 years into consideration the massive societal changes and challenges facing post 9-11 America, let's come to appreciate what a steady leader he was through some rough patches of societal change, even if I think put officers lives in danger by not calling for a proper investigation without printing the worst types of "race-bait click bait "reactionary bullshit.  the president should not issue hot takes like skip bayless, and instead work on the MOST important issues facing America. If that happens to be race relations during the feurgesin unrest speak to those issues however you feel is appropriate, but be prepared to condemn the riots your words cause as you repeatedly called on trump to admonish groups x y and especially "Z".

It begins to sadden me as I feel left behind by the turn that our party is taking. Intolerance towards others has grown, science has taken a back seat to illogical beliefs, and more importantly our economic policies have proven that they do not provide true growth for the middle class. I recently read a post about some George Washington University Republicans were asking for religious exemption from learning about how to tolerate the LGBT community. A few thoughts came to mind. Firstly and less important, having been raised a Lutheran I found it egregious that any member of the Christian faith would want "exemption" for learning how to be tolerable of other peoples beliefs. What concerned me more about the situation was that as Republicans, we continue to argue for religious exemptions from things that make us uncomfortable. Another example of this same ridiculous ideal is that we used religious exemption from allowing interracial and gay marriage. It's time we get our heads out of the gutter and realize that we need to be okay with social progress, it will keep the party alive and respected.Secondly scientific evidence is something we need to start listening to. The climate is changing, no matter how many studies you may try and find in opposition, over 90% of scientists have agreed man is causing it. Inhofe is an oaf for bringing a snowball to Congress, and we need to distance ourselves from him and others of the like because they do not understand, nor even try and comprehend, any scientific reason. Furthermore let us not forget the President who created the EPA (Nixon) and that historically we favor scientific evidence. If we get behind climate change people will take us seriously at all levels, as students of liberal universities we are the first to understand that concept.Lastly we need to try something else regarding economic policy. We must remember the lessons of our economic past. Positively we must look to job creation through government means on occasion. Transportation bills helped create a booming economy, and in the wake of the Great Recession a government sponsored bill for working on our infrastructure would do good for job creation and credibility in Republican economic planning. We must also remember that as tax cuts are effective, they lose their potency the lower we cut the rates (look up the Laffer Curve.) In terms of the financial markets deregulation and repealing Glass-Steagall was a huge factor in the creation of the Great Recession, and lets take a moment of appreciation for John McCain who is in favor of reinstating that same type of legislation to prevent that from happening again. This rant was just to show you that this party is on the brink of losing everything. There was more to say, but I feel I've made a few good points. What we need to concern ourselves with is, do we want another New Deal Era, or will we show that we can learn from our mistakes and that we are a party to reckon with? I wish you all the best, and good luck to those of you with finals this week! nan nan nan nan nan Hello!Is anyone part of the Rutgers College Republicans chapter or been so in the past?

One of the non-parties Ms. Giuffre  ‚Äúnamed‚Äù repeatedly in the joinder motion was Ms. Maxwell. According to  the ‚Äúlurid details‚Äù of Ms. Giuffre included in the motion, Ms. Maxwell  personally was involved in a ‚Äúsexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme‚Äù  created by Epstein: ¬ß Ms. Maxwell ‚Äúapproached‚Äù Ms. Giuffre in 1999 when  Ms. Giuffre was ‚Äúfifteen years old‚Äù to recruit her into the scheme. ¬ß  Ms. Maxwell was ‚Äúone of the main women‚Äù Epstein used to ‚Äúprocure  under-aged girls for sexual activities.‚Äù ¬ß Ms. Maxwell was a ‚Äúprimary  co-conspirator‚Äù with Epstein in his scheme. Case 18-2868, Document 281,  08/09/2019, 2628234, Page6 of 66 7 ¬ß She ‚Äúpersuaded‚Äù Ms. Giuffre to go  to Epstein‚Äôs mansion ‚Äúin a fashion very similar to the manner in which  Epstein and his other co-conspirators coerced dozens of other children.‚Äù  ¬ß At the mansion, when Ms. Giuffre began giving Epstein a massage, he  and Ms. Maxwell ‚Äúturned it into a sexual encounter.‚Äù ¬ß Epstein ‚Äúwith the  assistance of‚Äù Ms. Maxwell ‚Äúconverted \[Ms. Giuffre\] into . . . a ‚Äòsex  slave.‚Äô‚Äù Id. Ms. Giuffre was a ‚Äúsex slave‚Äù from ‚Äúabout 1999 through  2002.‚Äù ¬ß Ms. Maxwell also was a ‚Äúco-conspirator in Epstein‚Äôs sexual  abuse.‚Äù ¬ß Ms. Maxwell ‚Äúappreciated the immunity‚Äù she acquired under  Epstein‚Äôs plea agreement, because the immunity protected her from  prosecution ‚Äúfor the crimes she committed in Florida.‚Äù ¬ß Ms. Maxwell  ‚Äúparticipat\[ed\] in the sexual abuse of \[Ms. Giuffre\] and others.‚Äù ¬ß Ms.  Maxwell ‚Äútook numerous sexually explicit pictures of underage girls  involved in sexual activities, including \[Ms. Giuffre\].‚Äù Id. She shared  the photos with Epstein. ¬ß As part of her ‚Äúrole in Epstein‚Äôs sexual  abuse ring,‚Äù Ms. Maxwell ‚Äúconnect\[ed\]‚Äù Epstein with ‚Äúpowerful  individuals‚Äù so that Epstein could traffic Ms. Giuffre to these persons.  ¬ß Ms. Giuffre was ‚Äúforced to have sexual relations‚Äù with Prince Andrew  in ¬ß ‚Äú\[Ms. Maxwell‚Äôs\] apartment‚Äù in London. Ms. Maxwell ‚Äúfacilitated‚Äù  Ms. Giuffre‚Äôs ¬ß sex with Prince Andrew ‚Äúby acting as a ‚Äòmadame‚Äô for  Epstein.‚Äù ¬ß Ms. Maxwell ‚Äúassist\[ed\] in internationally trafficking‚Äù Ms.  Giuffre and ‚Äúnumerous other young girls for sexual purposes.‚Äù ¬ß Ms.  Giuffre was ‚Äúforced‚Äù to watch Epstein, Ms. Maxwell and others ‚Äúengage in  illegal sexual acts with dozens of underage girls.‚ÄùPage 234\- Picture of Maxwell, prince Andrew drew and Giuffre.\- Ms Giuffre travel records are incomplete, many examples. She was being flown by them without keeping records some of the timePage 243\-  Detective Recarey knew that Maxwell was involved in the illegal sexual  activities at Epstein's house. He wanted to speak to her, but Maxwell  did not return his calls. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep.  Tr. at 28:23-29:10.\- A walk  through video taken during the execution of the search warrant revealed  photos of topless females at the home, and there was even a photograph  of Maxwell naked hanging in the home. The house staff who were deposed  in the civil cases each testified to Maxwell being the boss in charge of  everyone in the house.

Tr. at 169:1-169:4.Page 244\-  Rodriguez, the house butler from 2004 through 2005, a time period that  revealed daily sexual abuse of underage females, testified that Maxwell  kept a list of the local girls who were giving massages at her desk, and  that Maxwell kept nude photos of girls on her computer. See McCawley  Dec. at Exhibit 21, Rodriguez Dep. Tr. at 238:4-238:22; 302:19-303:10;  306:1- 306:24.\- Recarey testified  that when the search warrant was executed, the house had been sanitized  and the computers removed from the home. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit  13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 72:25-73:15.\-  Banaziak testified that the computers were removed by Adriana Ross,  another employee who answered to Maxwell. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit  19, Banaziak Dep. Tr. at 54:7-22.Page 245\-  Tony Figueroa, Ms. Giuffre's ex-boyfriend, did testify that Maxwell  personally requested that he find and bring girls to Epstein for sex  once Ms. Giuffre had escaped, and that when he brought the girls Maxwell  interacted with them. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 4, Figueroa Dep. Tr.  at 200:6-18; 228:23-229:21.\-  Rodriguez testified unequivocally that Maxwell was "the boss" and that  she knew everything that was going on. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 21,  Rodriguez Dep. Tr. 169:1-169:4.\-  Nude photographs were displayed throughout Epstein‚Äôs home. Furthermore,  Alfredo Rodriguez testified to Maxwell having pornography on her  computer. Rodriguez Dep. Tr. 150:10-17; 306:1-306:24.\-  He also testified to there being a collage of nude photos in Epstein's  closet. Id. 253:14-254:18. That collage was eventually taken into  evidence by Detective Recarey, who testified to that fact in his  deposition. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at  73:19-73:24.\- **And  those photos are still in the possession of the FBI or US Attorney's  Office. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep.

See  McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 14, Rizzo Dep. Tr. at 25:19-26:20.Page 246\-  Johanna Sjorberg testified that the Defendant bought her a camera for  the specific purpose of her taking nude photos of herself. See McCawley  Dec. at Exhibit 16 Sjoberg Tr. at 150.\-  Virginia Giuffre testified that there was a nude photograph of her at  the house. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5 Virginia Giuffre Tr. at 232  and 333.Page 264\-  Johanna Sjoberg, testified that Defendant recruited her under the guise  of a legitimate assistant position, but asked her to perform sexual  massages for Epstein, and punished her when she didn‚Äôt cause Epstein to  orgasm.\- Tony Figueroa testified  that Defendant contacted him to recruit high school-aged girls for  Epstein, and also testified that Maxwell and Epstein participated in  multiple threesomes with Virginia Giuffre.\-  the butler for Defendant‚Äôs close friend witnessed, first-hand, a  fifteen-year-old Swedish girl crying and shaking because Defendant was  attempting to force her to have sex with Epstein and she refused.\- Call this the ‚Äúyes-I‚Äôm-a-sextrafficker-but-only-of-sixteen-year-old-girls‚Äù defense.Page 265\-  Flight logs even reveal twenty-three flights that Defendant shared with  Ms. Giuffre ‚Äì although Defendant claims she is unable to remember even a  single one of those flights.\-  Defendant‚Äôs heavy and extensive involvement in both Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs  sex trafficking ring and in recruiting Ms. Giuffre, living with her and  Jeffrey Epstein in the same homes while Ms. Giuffre was a minor, and  traveling with Ms. Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein ‚Äì including 23 documented  flights. Even the house staff testified that Defendant and Ms. Giuffre  were regularly together.Page 266\-  The record evidence in this case shows that Defendant shared a  household with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein for many years. While  there, she actively took part in recruiting underage girls and young  women for sex with Epstein, as well as scheduling the girls to come  over, and maintaining a list of the girls and their phone numbers.\-  Ms. Giuffre was indisputably a minor when Defendant recruited her to  have sex with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Thereafter, Ms.  Giuffre flew on Epstein‚Äôs private jets ‚Äì the ‚Äì Lolita Express‚Äù ‚Äì with  Defendant at least 23 times.\- Ms.  Sjoberg‚Äôs account of her experiences with Defendant are chillingly  similar. As with Ms. Giuffre, Defendant, a perfect stranger, approached  Ms. Sjoberg while trolling Ms. Sjoberg‚Äôs school grounds. She lured Ms.  Sjoberg into her and Epstein‚Äôs home under the guise of a legitimate job  of answering phones, a pretext that lasted only a day. A young college  student, Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page12 of 74 5  nearly 2,000 miles from home, Defendant soon instructed Ms. Sjoberg to  massage Epstein, and made it clear that Sjoberg‚Äôs purpose was to bring  Epstein to orgasm during these massages so that Defendant did not have  to do it.Page 268\-  Ms. Sjoberg also testified about sexual acts that occurred with her,  Prince Andrew, and Ms. Giuffre, when she and Defendant were staying at  Epstein‚Äôs Manhattan mansion.\- **Prince Andrew using a puppet to touch Ms. Giuffre‚Äôs breast while using a hand to touch Ms. Sjoberg‚Äôs breast.**\-  Tony Figueroa testified that Plaintiff told him about threesomes Ms.  Giuffre had with Defendant and Epstein which included the use of  strap-ons.Page 269\-  Figueroa also testified that Defendant called him to ask if he had  found any other girls for Epstein, thereby acting as procurer of girls  for Epstein:Page 270\-  Mr. Rizzo testified - through tears ‚Äì how, while working at Dubin‚Äôs  house, he observed Defendant bring a 15 year old Swedish girl to Dubin‚Äôs  house. In distress, the 15 year old girl tearfully explained to him  that Defendant tried to force her to have sex with Epstein through  threats and stealing her passport.Page 271\-  Lyn Miller is Ms. Giuffre‚Äôs mother. She testified that when Ms. Giuffre  started living with Defendant, Defendant became Ms. Giuffre‚Äôs ‚Äúnew  momma.‚Äù 10 Incredulously, Defendant testified that she barely remembered  Ms. Giuffre.\- Detective Recarey  led the Palm Beach Police‚Äôs investigation of Epstein. He testified that  Defendant procured girls for Epstein, and that he sought to question her  in relation to his investigation, but could not contact her due to the  interference of Epstein‚Äôs lawyer.Page 272\-  Notably, at Defendant‚Äôs deposition, Defendant refused to admit that she  flew with Ms. Giuffre, and denied that she appeared on Epstein‚Äôs  pilot‚Äôs flight logs.13\- However,  David Rodgers, Epstein pilot, testified that the passenger listed on his  flight logs bearing the initials ‚Äì GM ‚Äì was, in fact, Ghislaine  Maxwell, and that he was the pilot on at least 23 flights in which  Defendant flew with Plaintiff. 14 The dates of those flights show that  Ms. Giuffre was an underage child on many of them when she flew with  Defendant.\- Both Sarah Kellen and  Nadia Marcinkova lived with Jeffrey Epstein for many years. They both  invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about Defendant‚Äôs participation  in recruiting underage girls for sex with Epstein.Page 273\-  Jeffrey Epstein invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about  Defendant‚Äôs involvement in procuring underage girls for sex with him.Page 274\-  Defendant has not been able to procure a single witness - not one ‚Äì to  testify that Defendant did not procure girls for sex with Epstein or  participate in the sex.\- Even one of her own witnesses, Tony Figueroa, testified that she both procured girls and participated in the sex.\-  Another one of Defendant‚Äôs witnesses, Ms. Giuffre‚Äôs mother, named  Defendant as Ms. Giuffre‚Äôs ‚Äúnew mamma.‚Äù Indeed, those who knew her well,  who spent considerable time with her in Epstein‚Äôs shared household,  like Juan Alessi, Alfredo Rodriguez and Joanna Sjoberg, have testified  that she was Epstein‚Äôs procuress.\-  Others who lived with her ‚Äì Jeffrey Epstein, Nadia Marcinkova, and  Sarah Kellen ‚Äì invoked the Fifth Amendment so as not to answer questions  on the same. No one has testified to the contrary.\- **Defendant  has never offered a legal explanation for what she was doing with, and  why she was traveling with, a minor child on 21 flights while she was a  child, including 6 international flights, aboard a convicted pedophile‚Äôs  private jet all over the world.**Page 275\- Defendant never offered an explanation regarding Ms. Giuffre‚Äôs photographs of her, Defendant, and Epstein.\-  She never offered a legal explanation for why Prince Andrew was  photographed with his hand around Ms. Giuffre‚Äôs bare waist while she was  a minor child, while posing with Defendant, inside Defendant‚Äôs house in  London.\- This photograph  corroborates Ms. Giuffre‚Äôs claims, and there is no other reasonable  explanation why an American child should be in the company of adults not  her kin, in the London house owned by the girlfriend of a now convicted  sex offender.\- Ms. Giuffre also  produced pictures of herself taken when she was in New York with  Defendant and Epstein, and from a trip to Europe with Defendant and  Epstein.Page 276\- Ms. Giuffre has produced a number of pictures of herself taken at the Zorro Ranch, Epstein‚Äôs New Mexico Ranch.\-  Among other nude photos, which included full nudes of Defendant, Ms.  Giuffre produced images of females that the Palm Beach Police  confiscated during the execution of the 22 See McCawley Dec at Exhibit  42, GIUFFRE007175; 007173.

The U.S. Attorney mailed Ms. Giuffre a notice of  her rights as a crime victim under the CVRA.\-  Ms. Giuffre has provided extensive medical records in this case,  including medical records from the time when Defendant was sexually  abusing and trafficking her. Ms. Giuffre produced records supporting her  claim of being sexually abused in New York resulting in both 23 See  McCawley Dec at Exhibit 44, GIUFFRE007584. 24 See McCawley Dec. at  Exhibit 30, GIUFFRE 002216-002218, Victim Notification Letter.

Defendant  repeatedly and vehemently argued to the Court that it was essential to  procure every page of these records in a fanfare of unnecessary motion  practice.\- Ms. Giuffre sought  counseling from a psychologist for the trauma she continued to  experience after being abused by Defendant and Epstein. A 2011  psychological treatment record, written by her treating psychologist,  unambiguously describes Defendant as Ms. Giuffre‚Äôs abuser.Page 279\-  Years before Defendant defamed her, Ms. Giuffre confided in her  treating psychologist that Maxwell recruited her for sex with Epstein.\-  Detective Recarey, the lead investigator of the criminal investigation  into Epstein and his associates‚Äô sex crimes, recovered carbon copies of  hand-written messages taken by various staff, including Defendant, at  Epstein‚Äôs Palm Beach residence.\-  The messages raise a question of fact as to Maxwell‚Äôs involvement in the  sexual abuse of minors and are relevant to refute Maxwell‚Äôs denial of  any involvement with Epstein during relevant time periods, and,  accordingly her denial of knowledge of certain events.Page 280\-  Messages reveals that Maxwell, ‚ÄúGM,‚Äù took messages at the residence,  including from underage girls who were calling to schedule a time to  come over to see Epstein.Page 282\-  One message pad reflects , who is identified in the Palm Beach Police  Report as a minor, contacting Jeffrey Epstein for ‚Äúwork‚Äù explaining that  she does not have any money. The term ‚Äúwork‚Äù was often used by members  of Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs sexual trafficking ring to refer to sexual  massages.\- Giuffre 001462: July 5th no year to JE from ‚ÄùI need work. I mean I don‚Äôt have money. Do you have some work for me?‚Äù\-  Other message pads reflect who was a minor, calling and leaving a  message at the Palm Beach mansion that she has recruited another girl  for Jeffrey Epstein. The second message demonstrates that Jeffrey  Epstein required different girls to be scheduled every day of the week.  The third shows an offer to have two minor girls come to the home at the  same time to provide sexual massages. These type of messages indicate  the lack of secrecy of the fact that multiple young females were  visiting every day and at least raises a question of fact whether  Maxwell was knowledgeable and involved as Giuffre has said, or whether  Giuffre was lying and Maxwell was not at all involved or aware of this  activity, as Defendant would attempt to have the world believe\-  Giuffre 001428 ‚Äì undated Jeffrey From ‚Äì ‚ÄúHas girl for tonight‚Äù ;Giuffre  001432 (pictured above)‚Äì 7/9/04 ‚Äì Mr. Epstein From ‚Äì ‚Äú is available on  Tuesday no one for tomorrow‚Äù; GIUFFRE 001433 /1/17/04 ‚Äì Mr. Epstein from  ‚Äì ‚ÄúMe and \_\_\_\_\_ can come tomorrow any time or alone‚Äù ; Giuffre ‚Äì 001452  ‚Äì undated Jeffrey from ‚ÄúHas girl for tonight.‚Äù\-  Other message pads demonstrate that there was a pattern and practice of  using young females to recruit additional young females to provide  sexual massages on a daily basis.\-  Giuffre 001413 (pictured above)‚Äì JE from ‚ÄúN‚Äù ‚Äì ‚Äú hasn‚Äôt confirmed for  11:00 yet, so she is keeping on hold in case doesn‚Äôt call back; Giuffre  001448 -8/20/05 JE from - confirmed \_\_\_ at 4 pm.

Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page28 of  74 21 with the Defendant on September 10, 2005. The police were only  able to retrieve a fraction of these message pads during their trash  pull but even in the few they recovered, it shows Maxwell was regularly  at the Palm Beach home during the time period she claimed she was not.  To the contrary, she was both sending and receiving messages and  messages, like this one, reflect her presence at the mansion.\-  Giuffre 001412 ‚Äì 9/10/05 (during the year Maxwell says she was never  around) JE from ‚Äì ‚ÄúI went to Sarah and made her water bottle and I went  to work out with GM.‚Äù\- These  message pads further corroborate that Defendant lied in her testimony  and she was in fact in regular contact with Jeffrey Epstein during the  years 2004 and 2005. For example, the message from ‚ÄúLarry‚Äù demonstrates  that Defendant is at the Palm Beach mansion so frequently that people,  including Epstein‚Äôs main pilot Larry Visoski, are leaving messages for  Maxwell at the Palm Beach house.\-  Giuffre 001435 7/25/04 ‚Äì Mr. Epstein from Ms. Maxwell ‚Äì ‚Äútell him to  call me‚Äù; Giuffre ‚Äì 001449 ‚Äì 8/22/05 ‚Äì JE from GM; Giuffre ‚Äì 001453 ‚Äì  4/25/04 for Ms. Maxwell From Larry ‚Äúreturning your call‚Äù;\-  This message pad shows that Defendant was clearly actively involved in  Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs life and the activities at his Palm Beach mansion.\-  Giuffre ‚Äì 001454 ‚Äì undated Jeffrey From Ghislaine ‚Äì ‚ÄúWould be helpful  to have \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ come to Palm Beach today to stay here and help train  new staff with Ghislaine.‚Äù\- This  message pad clearly reflects an underage female (noted by the police  redaction of the name) leaving a message asking if she can come to the  house at a later time because she needs to ‚Äústay in school.‚Äù\-  ‚Äù Giuffre 001417 (pictured above)‚Äì Jeffrey 2/28/05 Redacted name ‚ÄúShe  is wondering if 2:30 is o.k.

These numbers included those of  underage females (with no training in massage therapy ) ‚Äì including ‚Äì  identified during the criminal investigation of Epstein. This document  is an authentic reflection of the people who were associated with  Epstein, Defendant, and the management of their properties, and the  knowledge each had of the contents of the document.**Sex Slave Amazon.com Book Receipt**\- Detective Recarey authenticated an Amazon.com receipt that the Palm Beach Police collected from Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs trash.\- The books he ordered are titled:(1) SM 101: A Realistic Introduction, Wiseman, Jay;(2)  SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for Erotic Servitude ‚Äì Principles, Skills and  Tools by Guy Baldwin; and (3) Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook  for Erotic Slaves and Their Owners, by Christina Abernathy, as shown  below: 32 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 45, Phone List, Public Records  Request No.: 16-268 at 2282 ‚Äì 2288.

Additionally,  Defendant testified that she was not with Jeffrey Epstein in 2005 and  2006 when he was ordering books on how to use sex slaves; however,  record evidence contradicts that testimony.Page 287**Thailand Folder with Defendant‚Äôs Phone Number**\-  Defendant also was integral in arranging to have Virginia go to  Thailand. While Epstein had paid for a massage therapy session in  Thailand, there was a catch.\- Defendant told Virginia she had to meet young girls in Thailand and bring her back to the U.S. for Epstein and Defendant.\-  On the travel records and tickets Defendant gave to Virginia, Defendant  wrote on the back the name of the girl Virginia was supposed to meet,  and she was also instructed to check in frequently with Defendant as it  was further signified by the words ‚ÄúCall Ms. Maxwell (917) !‚Äù on  Virginia‚Äôs travel documents. In this case, Virginia also produced the  hard copy records from her hotel stay in Thailand paid for by Epstein.\-  The FBI report and the Churcher emails reference Ms. Giuffre‚Äôs accounts  of sexual activity with Prince Andrew that she made in 2011, contrary  to Defendant‚Äôs argument that Ms. Giuffre never made such claims until  2014. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan LTC Allen West was asked about Colin Kaepernick and kneeling at the YAF event at Notre Dame:[https://theoldschoolpatriot.com/abw/colin-kaepernick-kneeling/](https://theoldschoolpatriot.com/abw/colin-kaepernick-kneeling/)&#x200B;\--MCathranMod for [Allen B.

His first action was to place me (the youngest person in the local party) as one of the Vice-Chairman of Youth Recruitment. My job is to start and organize local efforts for recruitment of those 25 and younger as well as be the liaison between the local party and the College/Teen Republicans. It is an honor to say the least and a great opportunity to start making a difference in promoting conservatism values among our younger generations.   I am fortunate that the area is blessed with a growing university population of around 9,000 students as well as 5-6 high schools that draw students from consistently Republican voting districts.  The problem I face is that I was never a part of Teen or College Republicans when I was going through high school and college so I don't exactly know what to do at these meetings. I know that our local meetings always have speakers and we talk about ongoing party business but I was not sure if that is the correct way to go with a younger crowd. I can get a few speakers in to speak but is that something that I always need to do?  I also am in charge of setting up the Teen Republicans throughout our local school system as well which I have some great support already built up in to work with but I face the same challenge of not knowing what to do at meetings past organizing the efforts and bringing in a speaker or two.  What did/does your College/Teen Republicans do during your regular meetings? Is there any advice you can give me? I know if I provide real support in the beginning that we can avoid the falling off of these groups in the local area as the party is pushing a lot of support and funding for us to succeed. I just need to get it all organized and provide the value at these meetings for the students to show up.   nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan Why don't Republicans simply do what Libertarians/Anarcho-capitalists advocate for, since they're all pro-free-market? nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan A warning: this is satire. Except where it isn't.**Who is r/Republican for?**This should be simple: Republicans but that could not be further from the truth, my friend.**Acceptable people of the current sub:*** Trump supporters who aren't assholes like r/t_d users* Trump haters who don't voice it but identify as Republicans* Liberal brigaders (until they're banned)* Token LGBTQ republican user.

Because they're incapable of doing anything good or intelligent. So there's nothing to post anyways.* Anything about bipartisinship because that would require Liberals having good ideas. See above.

I always knew I'd never be unbanned - but it sure was amusing to type all this hilarity out in order to offer some levity to people taking the internet so seriously.Thanks and goodbye forever!

It depends on what the definition of "is" is.Any spelling errors are seph's fault**About the author**u/wr3kt is a moron. Generally a civil moron - but a moron nonetheless. He likes to irritate people who act like they're hot shit followed by posting stupid shit himself. He identifies as moderate which is basically Liberal but at least he's not a Libertarian. Those guys huff glue. You can delete bad press, and ban people who don't agree with every republican principle(ban the president while your at at), but it doesn't change the fact that most of the articles you've removed are reporting facts you just can't accept, a real republican stands on principles, they don't hide in the back killing everything they don't agree with, thank you.  Genuinely curiousEdit: Special Counsel discussion has now been hidden His kind of thinking is absolutely poisonous and does nothing to benefit this sub. I was just banned for fairly criticizing his comment.No true conservative would oppose the first amendment like that. Whats with the lack of bans over people insulting John Kasich?There's literally people in that thread calling him a pussy and actively encouraging him to leave the Republican Party, and it doesn't seem to be an issue for the mods.I see much less getting removed from threads when people disagree with some stances the Republican Party takes, but calling John Kasich a pussy is fine?Edit: Got banned because this post shows a lack of constructive criticism and is just trolling apparently  First: I'm not here to start a "Grrrrrr, fuck the mods" discussion.That being said, I think mods stickying their own comments in an attempt to refute a posted article, [as here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/6o50e1/trump_putin_had_second_undisclosed_talk_at_g20/), is a questionable use of mod powers. That's not an announcement, it's not anything official so far as I can tell, it's just... well, a shitty way to act. What is the point of even having /r/Republican if you just ban everyone who disagrees with you. I don't have to support the Republican party in their every move. Opposition and discourse is the only reason why we have a great nation. This is how dictatorships come about.If you are going to continue with the same behavior you might as well close up the sub and just sticky a post with your political opinions. This sub used to be a place where you could get a good even mix of positions and ideas across the spectrum of the Right. Every once in a while there would be someone who got out of line and was dealt with but for the most part the links posted and the discussions within were civil and on topic. That isn't the case anymore. This place has become T_D light. I'm starting to see memes posted and even stickied? Most of the recent articles aren't pro-Republican but instead anti-democrat. I'm not here to bitch about democrats. I do that enough at home. I'm here, or at least I was, to discuss Republican policy and Republican positions with other Republicans... across the spectrum! Don't let /u/Chabanais poison the sub with hateful rhetoric.  He's a Reddit cancer and shouldn't be let loose to spread awful Breitbart articles as if they're a real reliable source.  Let him rule over Conservative and keep him away from real discussion. He's a troll. /u/Yosoff just permabanned me for violating rule 4. I asked for a clarification as to which one and the response was simply "all of them". Look at my post history. I'm critical of Trump in some areas but I'm certainly not critical of Republicans at-large. I came to this sub from a different forum (not reddit) after it became infested with Trump lovers defending everything the man ever does. Is that the destiny o /r/republican? To turn into /r/conservative?No idea if the other mods read this but /u/yosoff, if you're reading this, you precious little snowflake, go read a book about what it is like to be a Republican, since you clearly know nothing about it. I would PM you but you muted me. Go 1st amendment! Anti-Nazi sentiment will no longer be tolerated in r/Republican. I was banned for condemning Nazi rhetoric and murder. Be sure to keep all of your posts pro-Nazi from now on! Posts about Kathy Griffin in the past month: 4 Posts about Jared Kushner in the past month: 0SAFE SPACE! SAD!! According to the mod, I was banned for this comment;"Two important things from this, if this is true.Sessions has to recuse himself from anything involving Russia now.  The optics are very poor to have him involved now.If he lied under oath to Senator Frakens questions.  In the hearing he says that he has been called a Trump Surrogate a time or two and that he had no contact with Russian officials.    That statement needs to be explained and clarified.  If it can't, he has to resign."Now if this qualifies as anti republican comments so be it, however I wonder what the opinions of the mods are on top GOP members asking Sessions to recuse himself from the Russian probe and hoping he clarifies his statements.  Would their comments be viewed as anti republican?I understand the difficulty the mods have in administrating the sub, but if such mundane comments result in bans and mutes, you will only create a far right echo chamber. Pushing moderate republicans like myself away only hurts the party.  I dont understand it. If defending him causes you to get banned and demoted from mod to regular user why is he on the prominent GOP figure sidebar?!Edit: Well ive been banned. Its trolling to tell 1st amendment advocator yosoff if he doesnt like Kasich to remove him from the sidebar of prominent republicans. Its been fun guys.  Look, I get it. My comment triggered a nerve and now you're probably gonna ban me now. You know, it's pretty pathetic that you come in to the thread and claim that I've somehow shutdown conversation (despite the fact that my comment actually generated more discussion between opposing points of view), and your response is to literally lock and shut down the thread and delete my comments. I'm rooting for Republicans to pull up their bootstraps and reclaim their party from all these pansies and safe-spacers. Since this subreddit has turned into a support group for victims of yossof's moderation policies, I figure to point something out.If you think change is going to happen, you're wasting your time. No one here is going to make yossof see reason, and the moderators are not going to kick yossof out, no matter what you say. Yes, we all have a story of getting banned from /r/republican for what seems like entirely random and baseless reasons, and it's unfortunate. You could write a well-cited, reasonable, detailed argument that cites how your point espouses the virtues of William F Buckley and Ronald Reagan, but it won't resonate. Yossof isn't a Republican, and the other moderators are either afraid of yossof, feel tired and overstretched by the inquiries over yossof's arbitrary bans, or simply don't care.Whatever the motivations are, it is what it is. A thin-skinned, petulant child has stolen control of the Republican party. And the thin-skinned, petulant child that has ruined r/republican has felt empowered by this, and doesn't have any interest in reason or accountability. A subreddit that was once a discussion thread has been replaced by cancer, with yossof willingly providing the metastasis.So, I hope that some of you can find peace by choosing (knocks on wood) to be cancer free. I hope that any reasonable person reading this will do something in their real lives to help provide chemotherapy to a country that could clearly use it. The republican party will return, but it won't be because of anything you post in this sub, or /r/republican. nan I just got banned for "Rule 5. Do not make comments consisting entirely of leftist talking points or defending leftist ideology.Looking at my entire comment history on Reddit, I cannot figure out what supposedly ran afoul of that. In all eight of my Reddit comments (long time lurker very infrequent poster), I can't find one that is a leftist talking point or defends leftist ideology.In reverse order:1\. /u/IBiteYou said she could not find an Arizona poll on health care that was more recent than a year old. I found one, posted a link, and summarized the results given in the the poll.2\. Farther up in that same comment thread in direct response to the comment where /u/IBiteYou posted the older poll results and summarized them, and said that McCain is not representing the interests of his constituents, I asked if Senators are supposed to represent the interests of the constituents at time of election or at the time that they vote on legislation, and mentioned poll results that indicate Arizona residents (Republican and Democrat) have changed their opinions on healthcare in the last year.3\. In /r/The_Donald, on a story about a rape in Utah, the submitted headline said perps were African migrants. The submitted story just said that they were from a suburb of Salt Lake City, Utah. I asked where the submitted got the information that they were immigrants, and he responded citing a different article that had more information than the submitted one.4\. In a discussion submitted by /u/DEYoungRepublicans of an article warning that Republicans should not underestimate the risks of Sander's push for single-payer, I agreed that Republicans need to be careful because Democrats are trying to get people to think that single-payer is the only way to get universal healthcare, and if Democrats succeed in making that link we are going to end up at some point with single-payer.I went on to point out that there are countries with universal health care that do NOT use single-payer and that have outcomes as good as or better than the US currently does at half the cost, and named a specific such country, Switzerland, and suggested that Republicans should take a good hard look at how Switzerland achieved that and put together a plan based on that. I picked Switzerland because they are a highly capitalistic country, with a limited Federal government under which the Cantons (equivalent of our States) have much power and independence, The Heritage Foundation and Wall Street Journal's "Index of Economic Freedom" ranks them at #4 in the world (which is higher than the US, which they rank as #10), and their health care system is largely based on private providers. In other words, Switzerland is close to what Republicans say the US should be not only in health care but also in the structure of federal/state government in general.5\. Someone posted a link about hospitals in Britain having worse outcomes on weekends, implying that this was due to Britain having single-payer. Britain does in fact have a worse outcome on weekends. Unfortunately, it has nothing to do with single-payer as this same problem, called the "Weekend Effect", happens in the US and all or almost all other Western health care systems. I linked to the Wikipedia article on the weekend effect, which in turn cites numerous studies about this including many on its prevalence in the US.6\. I asked why /r/conservative doesn't appear to get a large number of outsiders down-voting things. Someone had said /r/republican gets that because large conservative reddits are being targeted, but /r/conservative is 3x as big as /r/republican.7\. In /r/conservative, someone implied that the juror pool is just registered voters. I commented that it used to be that way, but most states now, including California, also put people in the juror poll from driver license records.8\. A joke comment in /r/AskReddit 5 years ago that had no political or ideological comment whatsoever.Anyone have any ideas where the leftist talking points are in there? I posted [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/676bix/transcript_of_ap_interview_with_trump/dgp9a9i/) on a thread, and it has simply disappeared. There was no explanation, it just quietly went away, and I'm not sure why other than the fact that it might not have fit with mikeyPh's narrative. Can I get an explanation, please?For the record, the comment said this: "Sure, they're [the 100 day standard] stupid and arbitrary, but it's what he said. It's stupid to set out a plan, and when you fail, to blame others for holding you accountable for what you said you were going to do. Own it, and say that it turns out being president is a lot harder than he thought it would be, and some of these things take time, and he would rather build coalitions than ram things through. He put himself in this position, not the American people, not the media.Edit: the other thing about this is that it obviously does matter a ton to him. All of his talk about it being such a ridiculous standard is belied by the fact that he is going nuts trying to get something passed." Yosoff said:> Like they did with Garland? That was the best thing the Republicans have ever done.and I replied:> It might be the most shortsighted thing the party has ever done. An increasingly polarized judiciary is bad for everyone. The next time Democrats are in power they're going to swing that pendulum in the opposite direction. Judges should not be another arm of the political party that voted to appoint them.> You're now claiming "if they won't accept Judge Gorsuch, then they won't accept anyone" but that's exactly what was levied at McConnell when he refused to advance Garland's nomination. It is extremely hypocritical to say that's wrong now, and we should be well aware that this isn't going to end well for the country if moderate judges are rejected in favor of hardliners for either side.Here's a link to John McCain saying the same thing less than 48 hours ago: https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/floor-statements?ID=62FD7911-8845-4E03-8386-9FC304000D86How can I be banned permanently for making "anti republican statements" by saying the same thing as Republican senators? http://i.imgur.com/f6enGkE.png?1 Blocked out the username as he and the other mods will know who it is.1) Climate Change: Many of our representatives believe in Climate Change and the human causes behind it.[ In March, 17 GOP Representatives introduced a resolution](https://stefanik.house.gov/sites/stefanik.house.gov/files/Climate%20Change%20Resolution.pdf) to the House calling for action against the changing climate. I am a climate alarmist for acknowledging Climate Change? Are you anti-science and anti-logic for denying it? There are *many* more examples of GOP backed climate change policies and stances, many of our military branches have also deemed climate change as the largest non-military threat to the US. How am I banned because of this?2) Anti-Trump: This isn't a Trump subreddit, this is a Republican subreddit. We discuss policies, agendas, and how to implement a conservative approach to the government. My focus is on fiscal responsibility, of which Trump is lacking, so I point that out. Are we blind followers that cannot point out improvements? It is part of the 1st amendment after all.3) Pro-DACA: I push for a fiscally minded approach to policies, cut the fat and have the most bang for the buck. DACA was an overreach of executive power, but the results of it were a net positive on the economy and work force (more taxes that weren't there before, and a better educated workforce). The goal of DACA is what I supported, but not the means to get there, and I am hopeful that Congress will see the benefits of a DACA similar immigration policy can bring to the US's workforce and economy. Set aside my stance, there are many sitting GOP members who share a similar belief that DACA is a positive but needs to be brought through Congress. Can I please be unbanned? I am aligned with *many* sitting and previous GOP members, why am I silenced by sharing those stances?  Seems like nothing more than propaganda at this point. No criticism is allowed unless its of Democrats. We are living through one of the biggest political scandals of all time and the top post is about Kathy Griffith? Who gives a single solitary shit about her? I'm a liberal who likes to see what republicans are thinking and I lurk the sub because I was banned some time ago for pointing out that trump lied (also guilty of the crime of being critical of trump on other subs). You're more concerned about gloating about some washed up comedian than you are about the multiple ongoing investigations into Trump's administration? I know republicans and none of them are this steadfastly delusional. Good luck, because after insulating yourselves in this bubble it's going to be tough when reality comes knocking with the outcome of these investigations. I posted this video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBWUOOzuWIY> Do not make comments consisting entirely of leftist talking points or defending leftist ideology.The video is literally Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush talking about immigration.   It's almost comical that "articles" from this website gets posted every other day. You can't make this shit up.  There is a poster on /r/republican that has broken 3 rules: 4, 6, 11.He/She has insulted current Republicans (shit posted the sub disparaging a Republican, spread fake news ((Kasich making a joint ticket, which he has denied)), and posted threads that are very blatantly anti-Republican.Why is this poster still allowed access after blanantly breaking half of the rules? I'd like to know if there's a debate between locking posts and removing posts.I would definitely prefer locking because it's more transparent. A lock-explanation post on the thread or here explaining why, even if it seems obvious, would be even better, but I realize that's more mod work. I don't expect mods to engage in constant debates over their decisions, but understanding their decisions and giving the subscribers a place to have that debate ourselves would give at least some method of input to how we're getting moderated.The unexplained 'vanishing' of posts bothers me. Not comments so much, but definitely the posts. Especially when it feels like all posts of a certain subject are vanishing. When they simply vanish I don't know what went wrong or how the discussion could have been handled without getting vanished.I *definitely* don't expect this for auto-moderated posts. Probably not even for posts under 15 or 20 comments. But if there's a decent discussion going on about a subject I do want to know why a mod decides to remove it. Not just to understand how I'm getting moderated, but so I know how to have conversations that won't get moderated next time. If you are not a Republican, please do not mess up our front page or comment section by using the vote button. Articles and comments that are disportionately up voted may be removed at the discretion of the mods to prevent forum slide.Republicans can, of course, use the vote button but if you down vote something at least explain why. That was a post title on /r/conservative... I just wanted to reply to the question but I can't since I've been banned:What you guys can do about it is stop being cowards who need safe spaces and go and participate on /r/politics, the main political subreddit. Oh boo-fucking-hoo you are the minority there, maybe you'll learn to appreciate the struggle of people who are actually minorities within our society. They don't have the luxury of going off and making their own sanitized safe-space like you've done with /r/conservative and /r/republican.Bunch of fucking cowards... you retreated and gave up your voice on the main political section of one of the biggest websites on the internet viewed by millions every day. How many active users do you guys have, a few thousand? How many people view the stuff on /r/politics every day? Tens of millions? You lost Reddit because you are cowards too afraid of being called out on your beliefs by those who don't share them. I made some arguments in support of a popular vote. I think that there are strong arguments on all sides of the EC issue, and at no point was I disrespectful.I was banned with a Rule 5 citation, even though there are plenty of conservatives who, like me, believe that the EC is unfair to voters.  I messaged the mods and asked (politely, I might add) why I had been banned. I did not receive a reply for a full 24 hours, so I asked again. I received a curt reply and then was **muted** from replying for 72 hours. At no point was I rude or disrespectful.I would like my ban overturned, please. This was the first post in r/Republican about the press conference today.  I checked in before I left work, and while posts were obviously critical of Trump, there wasn't anything insulting or over the top.I finally check in again after I get home, and the post was locked and all posts removed.  Did anything happen or is this just another case of the mods not tolerating criticism of Trump? So let's start from the beginning.>You have been banned from participating in r/Republican. You can still view and subscribe to r/Republican, but you won't be able to post or comment.>Note from the moderators:>>Rule 5>If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for r/Republican by replying to this message.Reminder from the Reddit staff: If you use another account to circumvent this subreddit ban, that will be considered a violation of the Content Policy and can result in your account being suspended from the site as a whole.And Rule 5 is...>Rule 5. Do not make comments consisting entirely of leftist talking points or defending leftist ideology.Ok. I get that. Expect my comment was,>Premiums were already rising before ACA. It's funny people forget that. The ACA accelerated the increases, but it wasn't the cause.[Permalink](https://np.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/6o237h/three_gop_senators_oppose_moving_forward_on/dke986q/)In response to, >2ndly, going into your premise, the problem with that is 2 years is a lot of money to the average American in premiums... ACA is already a sinking ship, each year premiums get higher.... it could costs Americans millions if not billions just in the next 2 years alone...Ok, first, thing first. While that comment is a bit of hyperbole we'll ignore that. The main point is that their second reason for not liking Obamacare and calling it a sinking ship, is that premiums are rising. I agree that the premiums are rising at an accelerated rate due to the ACA, which I clearly state in my comment. However, it is wrong to say that the ACA is the cause of the rise in premiums. Which I think is an important distinction. Now I did not link anything to show this. I will do that now. [Average Individual Health Insurance Premiums Increased 99% Since 2013, the Year Before Obamacare, & Family Premiums Increased 140%, According to eHealth.com Shopping Data](http://news.ehealthinsurance.com/news/average-individual-health-insurance-premiums-increased-99-since-2013-the-year-before-obamacare-family-premiums-increased-140-according-to-ehealth-com-shopping-data)If you would like more detailed information on the data, please visit this link, [ehealth, Cost and Benefits of Individual and Family Health Insurance - PDF](http://news.ehealthinsurance.com/_ir/68/201311/eHealth%202013%20Cost%20and%20Benefits%20Report.pdf)Now, I think the above link shows that health insurance premiums were already rising. So, I fail to see how my comment fall under Rule 5,>Do not make comments consisting entirely of leftist talking points or defending leftist ideology.I was simply stating a fact. Now, does my fact support leftist talking points. Sure. But does ignoring the truth help anything? Did I say the ACA was perfect? No. In fact, my only comment is simply pointing out that person's premise is flawed. Not an attack on the right as a whole. I will also point out that I was banned from /r/Conservative because I said the Planned Parenthood Video is a lie. [Here is the permalink](https://np.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/6iteun/planned_parenthood_spent_734000_not_on_womens/dj9e0uk/) to my comment for full disclosure. I would like to point out it is sitting at +3 as of writing this comment. In that it is selectively edited. It purports to show the discussion of a sale price for fetal tissue. In reality, the discussion revolves around the cost of storing and shipping donated fetal tissue for medical research. Selling fetal tissue is illegal. Charging for the shipping of it is not. I would also like to point out, since the release of the video Planned Parenthood has stopped charging for the shipping of the tissue. So, now the tissue is donated and Planned Parenthood covers all the expenses of that donation.It's kind of like donating your body for science then having to pay shipping cost to get your body to wherever it needs to go. Either way, there is my case. I don't think anything will change. Now, if you want to unban me for both incidents and promptly ban me for being a liberal. I would be much more ok with that. At least, the subs aren't banning for stating facts and nuances. They would be banning for something that will have a strong argument in favor of banning, even from myself. Thanks All! Just glancing through the most recent submissions to the sub, there are links from the sites us.blastingnews.com, mynewsguru.com, and realclimatescience.com on the first page.In full fairness, I have a general policy against visiting unfamiliar domains and haven't followed any of those links, and I certainly don't want to accuse those sites of being "fake news" without ever having visited them.  At the same time, they don't strike me as being particularly credible sources, and at first glance, those URLs do closely resemble the types of sources that were spreading disinformation during the election season. Meanwhile, stories from generally well-respected outlets like the NYT and Politico get tagged with "biased domain."  For the sake of the credibility of the sub, particularly in regards to the perceptions of non-Republicans who might be open to becoming Republicans, this difference in treatment of submission sources (fringe sites go untagged/NYT gets tagged automatically) strikes me as a place where there's room for improvement on the sub.If submissions from oddball sites are going to be allowed, I think it could be beneficial to adopt a new tag similar to the "biased domain" one.  Maybe something along the lines of "unknown domain" or "non-vetted source" would do the trick.  As it stands, the presence of a tag on a NYT article and the lack of one on a us.blastingnews.com article could very easily give the impression that this sub holds the latter to be more trustworthy than the former, and that just seems like really bad branding for the sub, for lack of a better term.  Thanks to the mods for all your work and dedication and to anyone else who read my post.  Thoughts and comments always appreciated. I was banned for Rule 4: Do not post anti-republican comments or submissions.I was banned immediately after submitting this post to /r/Republican:https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/6j2b0k/vladimir_putin_gave_direct_instructions_to_help/The post was locked, my comments (and all comments critical of Trump) were deleted yet other questionable comments such as, simply, "yawn" were not deleted.Here is my conversation with the mods about my ban:https://i.imgur.com/DUBbmYL.pngAnd here is my post history showing the two comments I made in that thread before it was locked:https://i.imgur.com/CcwnyNO.pngI did not post any anti-republican sentiment. When asked why I was banned I was told I was a "concern troll" and shown a mocking political cartoon.I think the only conclusion anyone can come to is that /r/Republican is entirely censored propaganda at this point. So now the sub is spam banning submissions. https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/6bryq0/special_counsel_appointed_to_lead_russia/ I'm curious if we're not to discuss the Sally Yates hearing in the /r/Republican thread, as I noticed it was no longer appearing.If you need an impartial link, I recommend directly linking the hearing itself on C-SPAN's page. It's mostly a bunch of posts from banned users (including myself) complaining about the moderators. Nothing gets fixed. Neither side hears each other. All this subreddit does is give the illusion that things could change, but nothing changes... As a Republican relatively new to the sub, I'm certainly frustrated by the impact of nonrepublicans on the discussion, but is the automod note actually solving anything except providing an added annoyance? Can we shorten/ditch it?  Half these "moderate" republicans irritate me at times too with the incessant Trump bashing, that being said, these are the sorta people we should focus on pulling back in for future years, isn't banning them just forcing them into the dems hands? I might get banned for this, but I think, even if we (I certainly do) disagree with them, banning them is not correct nan What is the definition that mods are using for justifying bans for "concern trolling"? For instance, I was banned from r/Republican recently (by u/Yossof I can only assume) for my comment in [this thread posted by u/Yossof](https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/68mbvf/how_democrats_suppress_the_vote/):>There's an awful lot of assumptions and begging going on in that article.>>Consider¬†a 2011 bill in Michigan¬†to move school board elections to November of even-numbered years. The Michigan Education Association, a teachers union, testified against the bill, as did associations of school boards and administrators. The bill ended up¬†passing¬†on nearly a party-line vote, with almost all Democratic legislators opposed and almost all Republican legislators in favor.>Ok, maybe *provide* their dissent then. Maybe it was legitimate opposition. The article seems to portray that any opposition to consolidation is automatically bad, but then states that some of those bills had other stuff in them than just consolidation. Without knowing *any* of that information, it's hard to come to any unbiased conclusion.Does that comment rise to the level of whatever your definition of "concern trolling" is? Did I make a mistake by having a Libertarian flair? Or did I strike a nerve of a ban-happy mod? I don't think my comment qualifies as left-leaning/pushing left talking points/etc. at all either. It was a poor article, and this sub (r/Republican) shouldn't tolerate it, even if it's posted by a mod. It was very much concern, but was not trolling - the desire to see a rationale, unbiased article shouldn't be shunned. I'm not trying to be combative, I just want some transparency. I've messaged the mods and never got a real answer as to what I did to cause my ban in r/republican. nan I've noticed that some threads are no longer on the "new" list, and discussion activity has more or less come to a screeching halt. My Fellow Republicans: I present to you, a subreddit with discussion, a subreddit with debate, a subreddit *like no other.*  If you like r/Republican, you'll love r/Tuesday!r/Tuesday is new subreddit for the dying center-right of American politics that welcomes both moderate Republicans and moderate Democrats. We post news, policy briefs, and discussion from that perspective, and are seeking to revive mainstream moderate conservatism both online and in Washington. The name comes from the Tuesday Group: an informal caucus (some would say Power Cabal) for centrist House Republicans currently led by Congressman Charlie Dent. (And yes. They meet on Tuesday. Their previous iteration was called "the Wednesday Group" because they met on Wednesday. They tend to compensate for their strength in policy with a weakness in the snazzy names department). If you're a right-leaning moderate or centrist, r/Tuesday is the place for you! We're an active subreddit, with a bi-weekly discussion thread and continual updates from policy and news sources as fast as our users can find them. And after a short period of approved submitter only, we are now *open for business!* Come join us, and keep alive the flame of the moderate center-right. Thank you, Autarch_Severian  I was apparently banned for rule 4 because my last 6 comments were heavily anti-republican http://imgur.com/a/x1IWHAs you can see none of my comments were anti-republican, my 6th actually criticizing democrats. If linking Trump's budget is actually considered anti-republican why aren't we all banned then?Also why did Yossof (who's committed multiple rule 4 and rule 11 violations) ban me for something I didn't do? Would love to hear from another mod of r/republican Thanks in advance nan That subreddit is truly filled with and moderated by treasonous wingnuts. At least /r/Conservative doesn't pretend to be even-minded or reasonable.Edit: autocorrected to Putting in lieu of Putin on the title; I guess it's staying up there Blog posts are usually extremely biased and make claims that are unfounded. https://i.imgur.com/6cUmgSw.pngThe posts in question:https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/6d4uh1/cbo_score_hr_1628_american_health_care_act_of/di0wfe8/https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/6d4uh1/cbo_score_hr_1628_american_health_care_act_of/di0wn8w/This isn't moderating a subreddit, this is cultivating a propaganda machine... or a safe space. The mods haven't replied to me asking; they cited a rule 5 violation, but none of my posts are removed and I can't find anything that counts as a "leftist talking point". I specifically came here to take a break from the left side circlejerk, and I was having quite a nice time talking to pleasant right-wing folk as a guest. If you want, I'll provide a list of my posts, I didn't make many.It's entirely your right to ban me, it's your sub and I'm not a republican, nor at any point did I claim to be. However if you're going to ban folk for admitting to be visitors, you may want to remove the bit in the sidebar that implies we're allowed to post here as guests, and change it to indicate that non-republicans shouldn't post at all. In response to someone saying this about the attempted filibuster of Gorsuch:> If they aren't willing to accept him then they aren't willing to accept any Trump appointment. It's pure partisan pettiness.I wrote this:> I don't think you can draw that conclusion yet. To draw that conclusion I think you'd need to have Gorsuch torpedoed, get another Trump appointment, and then have that one also torpedoed. That's because the first one might be explained by game theory, if you view the Senate as a two player (R vs. D) game where each side needs some cooperation from the other to accomplish its goals. In such a game a good strategy is often to keep cooperating on your turn as long as the other player also does so. If the other player initiates non-cooperation, you respond by one turn of non-cooperating. It's called tit-for-tat. This could be the Democrats tit-for-tat response to what was done with Garland.Blammo! Instant ban for rule 4.How is that anti-Republican? I was banned for violating Rule 11 and I'm not sure why. I recently complimented the Bushes, agreed with Yosoff on a topic, gave other people shit for seemingly trolling the sub with scare tactics and called out somebody for Mass posting in our sub.I did call Trump polarizing, not sure if that's worth a ban, waiting on an answer.Edit: I got additional information.You broke Rule 11. ‚Ä¢ Rule 11. "Thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican." (Reagan's 11th Commandment)You could have said; "I disagree with Trump on position X because reason Y." That would have been fine, but you didn't do that. You simply threw out generic insults.Try /r/Tuesday, they'll let you do stuff like that there.My guess is that calling Trump polarizing got me banned. [Stickied post](https://i.imgur.com/AKBqUXq.png) accusing Kasich of supporting amnesty and Obamacare and wanting to "spend more."[My comment](https://i.imgur.com/Vp6eWgN.png) pointing out that Reagan did the same thing (gasp! there are more than one type of Republican!) and expressing disappointment that we're eating our own[Message to the moderators](https://i.imgur.com/VMKMWdl.png) saying I thought the post violated Rule 11 (ironically, "Reagan's Rule"); Yosoff replies to say no, the post doesn't violate the rule but somehow my comment about Reagan *does*!Immediately muted, of course, I assume because the reasoning is indefensible. Would love for someone here to point out where I went wrong I had an argument with /u/Yosoff about this statement:>Nobody who voted for Hillary actually has a job and pays taxes or is smart enough to even understand what taxes are.This was my reply (and the comment I got banned for):>What you said:>>Nobody who voted for Hillary actually has a job and pays taxes or is *smart enough to even understand what taxes are.*>From [Pew Research Center](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/09/behind-trumps-victory-divisions-by-race-gender-education/):>>In the 2016 election, a wide gap in presidential preferences emerged between those with and without a college degree. College graduates backed Clinton by a 9-point margin (52%-43%), while those without a college degree backed Trump 52%-44%.>Quoting a Latin phrase does not make your claim less ridiculous whatsoever. It just wastes everyone's time by forcing them to look it up.Rule 5 states:>Do not make comments consisting entirely of leftist talking points or defending leftist ideology. As anyone can clearly see, this has nothing to do with ideology. It is simply an argument about the facts of a claim. I messaged the mods saying so, and added "I do not understand why I was banned." I was then muted from messaging the mods for 72 hours./u/Yosoff: quite frankly, I think this is insane. I know you're the only moderator of this subreddit, so I don't believe for a second you'll actually unban me. I just want you to know that I literally cannot believe how petty you are. OK, I just got banned. I'm not going to ask for un-banning, but would like to know why I was banned.The ban was in response to a comment of mine that was a reply to a comment that mentioned climate change and hurricanes, and suggested that this is not a significant issue. This was my comment:------ begin comment -----Speaking of hurricanes and climate change...Number of category 4 hurricanes per year:Period|Number|Number per Year-----|----:|-----:1851-1900|13|0.261901-1950|29|0.581951-1975|22|0.881976-2000|24|0.962001+|21|1.4----- end comment ----I'm at a loss to figure out what rule that violated. Go to r/Republican RIGHT NOW.Have a look.  Posts downvoted to zero or below include: * gowdy suggests bill clinton did seek to obstruct loretta lynch in the hillary investigations * Democratic Party Image Dips, GOP Ratings Stable (a link to Gallup polling) * STUDY: How Many Republicans Trust The Mainstream Media? The Number Is Stunning  * Icelandic Leftist Poisons Robert Spencer  * Why Today's 'Liberals' are the REAL Extremists * Family's private investigator: There is evidence Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks prior to death * Ryan: 'Planets are aligned' on tax reform * GOP lawmakers mark success by flipping rules from Obama era  * 12 times Dems, Repubs said no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion; 10 times people claimed there wasNow ... these are only some of the posts downvoted to below zero.Let's look at the most upvoted posts on r/Republican in the same period.  * Robert Mueller appointed special Counsel  * Special counsel appointed to lead Russia investigation  * CNN Debate Live: Bernie Sanders (I-VT) vs John Kasich (R-OH) * Sen. Rand Paul: "Mandatory minimum sentences have unfairly and disproportionately incarcerated too many minorities for too long. Attorney General Sessions‚Äô new policy will accentuate that injustice" * Saudi Arabia plans to invest $40B in US infrastructure: report * Noam Chomsky: The GOP Is Still the Most Dangerous Organization in Human History (where some of the most upvoted comments are defending CHOMSKY) * James Comey 'wants to testify in public' about Russia  (What was that, "all the stories about Trump and Russia are being silenced" again?) * Graham: Trump 'calls me when I'm asleep' * Donald Trump says he wants to do press briefings instead of Sean Spicer (as you can imagine ... TRUST ME... all of the comments completely support Trump because that's all that is allowed on r/Republican, amirite?) * Trump warns Comey over leaks to media.  (Where, again, ALL the comments support Trump and anything else was totes censored because nothing else but Trump support is allowed on r/Republican.) * Trump: I was going to fire Comey regardless of DOJ recommendation (Where, again, the comments ONLY supported Trump OMG!  The CENSORSHIP... I cannot even!)So... anyone feel like S-ingTFU yet?  No, prolly not.  Carry on.  And take note of the fact that the subreddit is dying slowly.  Not because of censorship, but because people on the right are like, "Screw this noize." nan I often see poorly performing posts in r/republican tagged as "**Downvote brigaded**". But usually, these poor performing posts also have a lot of highly critical comments within them. So at least a few of the normal members of r/republican may indeed dislike the content. Is there a way by which the mods can distinguish between downvote brigading (outside voters manipulating the subreddit), and bad content (real members just didn't like it)? I'm tired of the circlejerks and immature drama of r/republican and r/conservative.  Is there a good alternative subreddit that takes the value of free speech seriously?  I would love to see a conservative sub that takes r/libertarian's approach to moderation. I guess it's a rule four ban.Oh well, I'be been banned from TD anyway. Hi,I'm only an occasional commentor on r/republican, but generally enjoy reading the discussions, here.I was banned - without any described reason - today, for the one comment I made regarding the Virginia incident.Upon asking the moderation team why I was banned, I was muted for 72 hours, without any described reason.Why?[Image link to the responsible comment by me.](https://i.imgur.com/AsnB1vK.png)[Image link to the one and only message I sent to the moderator group.](https://i.imgur.com/cx9iklW.png) nan Disclaimer: I am currently banned from r/republican due to "leftist talking points". That said, I am writing this in hopes that the mod team and those of us who currently feel marginalized can come together for the good of the board. Mods, as someone who attempted to write thoughtful, educated critiques of party actions and rhetoric how can I pursue my goal of provoking conversations that revolve around important issues to the Republican party going forward. I have no desire to be branded a leftist, and (as one who is prohibitively anti censorship) want to create an environment that allows for republicans to engage in the Socratic method and put the issues that divide our country through an honest gauntlet in order to allow our party to better represent itself through all of its levels. As some of the most dedicated members of this subreddit, what is your opinion of these desires? Do yall consider this reasonable? And if not, how can I amend my method to be more in line with procedure without jeopardizing my desire to create an ideologically effective party? Looks like you guys are taking a lot of shit right now.  For months, though, it's been clear that liberal concern trolls and liberals in general have been trying to drive down the subreddit.I know that it isn't easy ... and I know it takes a lot of time ... and I know that it only results in a ton of gripes from unsatisfied whiners.Thank you for cracking down and trying to make the subreddit what it once was:  A place where legitimate Republicans of all stripes were able to submit and participate. Post in question: https://np.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/63lxpa/no_republicans_didnt_just_strip_away_your/?st=j15agx2i&sh=ecb4d8bb Just curious why the AP story on Manafort is locked.  Was going to post it myself, but saw that it was already posted but locked down and was wondering what's going on with that.Thanks so much. nan Like don't get me wrong if that's what you individually want to believe than go ahead, but if this sub is going to promote anti-Trump (the *Republican* president) material, why not just throw t_d on the related subs list? (being facetious of course)Keep in mind well over half the GOP base voted *for* Trump, so whether you individually like him or not it's extremely biased to have "Hindsight in 2020" as a related subreddit to this sub.Unless you guys just want to blatantly come out and say Fuck Trump...but if you have that attitude are you *really* the best representation of the Republican party?  I've been banned for what I assume was expressing a desire for both Democrats and Republicans to work together, helping to return our government to a functioning state. This apparently breaks the rule of "defending leftist ideology". I'm rather confused, is collaboration something that I'm not allowed to desire as a Republican? Is this antithetical to the Republican platform somehow?I've been frustrated by the ever increasing party-agnostic attitude of "for us to win the other side has to lose." It's petty and destructive, and it clearly isn't helping us to get work done.Can anyone suggest a subreddit where a thoughtful center-right Republican would be welcomed to participate in constructive discussion without fear of reprisal? I've had some nice discussions in [/r/neutralpolitics](https://np.reddit.com/r/neutralpolitics), so something along those lines. I was going to ask for some more clarification after the mute was over, but I really feel like this went from confusing to ridiculous.I got Banned for a Rule 5 violation this morning for, I think, not believing Ted Nugent, which I didn't understand, but now the post is gone too. So the situation doesn't seem to make any sense. If not believing Ted Nugent's mea culpa attempt about violent rhetoric is a liberal talking point why was the post removed?I really don't get this at all. Even though I didn't believe him I don't understand why the post was removed, but if the post was removed I don't get why not believing him is a bannable offense.Edit: If you're just going to complain about censorship don't bother. I'm not after a mod bitch-fest. I just want to understand why decisions are made that I don't understand. The idea behind the survey is it would help us get a feel for the types of people we have subscribed to the sub. We always have people insisting they are republicans but the reasons they identify as such are not discussed. This can be used as a tool to both monitor the types of republicans we have but also monitor if those opinions change over time. Also, as we get this to be a little more robust and we get a base line for answers we might be able to help people really see if their views line up with the party's.  Often we get "but I AM a republican! But when you look into what their beliefs are they may not realize they have more in common with libertarians, facsism, socialism, democrats, or anarchists and simply have just gone with some "tribalism".  We don't want republicans that follow blindly on this sub.  We want republicans that have their ideas challenged and still understand what the party stance is the way it is and can empathize with it (maybe not sympathize but we take what we can get).But I need more potential answers and more questions from all spectrums of the Republican Party.  Nationalist, conservatives, neoconservatives, centrists, libertarian leaning republicans.  When including potential answers please express what type of republican would provide this answer and why.  If an answer would likely not be part of the Republican Party then also include what political ideation you think it might fall under.The idea is basically to create an "Isidewith" type poll but one that takes things a bit further and helps you find what aspect of a party you are more closely aligned.**TLDR: **What questions/stances would you like to know about our subscribers?Below is some of the questions we already have identified #Public Works and Spending1.0.1*What is your opinion of the government's role?

Internet Service Providers should be able to do whatever they want with the service they provide their customers.

In this day of information sharing where the internet has increasingly become a necessity for day to day work and life, the concept of Net Neutrality protects our first amendment rights for self expression and ensures a more equal footing for small business to be able to compete with larger more established business.

In this day of information sharing where the internet has increasingly become a necessity for day to day work and life, the concept of Net Neutrality protects our first amendment rights for self expression and ensures a more equal footing for small business to be able to compete with larger more established business. America by, comparison, has some of the worst internet prices and speeds in the developed world, ISPs need to be forced to compete.  Congress should enact legislation to end the noncompetitive business practices or ISPs and strengthen anti-trust laws to break up their "local monopoly" architecture.> D.  ISPs should be forced to share their utility lines with their competitors, everything else will fall into place after that. The government helped pay for that infrastructure, if the ISPs don't like it, then maybe they can install the next gen fiber optic communication channels (like we paid them to decades ago) and claim those as their own.

The argument that we spend too much on the military is defunct when compared to the percentage of GDP especially when you compare it to welfare programs.  > D. The US is still at war and we should provide enough support to end this war.  And if it takes a year, a few years or another decade just give them what they need.  Once the war is over then let's talk about drawing down the spending.> E. The funding provided to the military spending is a overly complex web of missed deadlines, over budget projects, and back door pork spending, it should not only not receive an increase in funding, it should have its funding significantly cut.******1.2.2Rank the following 1 being the most legitimate reason and 11 being the least legitimate reason to go to war.

Debt should not equal money and the nation's currency should be based on "real minerals">  B. ‚ÄúIt is incumbent on every generation to pay its own debts as it goes. A principle which if acted on would save one-half the wars of the world"  each iteration congress should be required to provide a balanced budget by the end of its term.> C. The government's debt is not like a house hold budget.  To arbitrarily require that a government pay its debts is to shift the burden of debt to the private sector.  It is easier for the tax payer to pay the debt of inflation than private industry.

It is impossible for the avg citizen to even compete against the might of the US military and therefore the concept of keeping weapons to prevent tyranny is laughable.  Guns are dangerous and should only be in the hands of trusted individuals.> C.

The continued hostilities with Russia are unwanted and a carryover from the long by gone era of the cold war.> B: Russia is a geopolitical foe, is dangerous and will find every opportunity to undermine us.

I was recently banned from r/Republican for ‚ÄúAttacking this subreddit on /r/shitrconservativesays‚ÄùI was little shocked, since I had done no such thing and responded, ‚ÄúI don't understand this ban. I didn't attack the subreddit, I pointed out an irony, which I also tried to do on the r/Republican subreddit. That's not attacking.‚ÄùYosoff then responded by saying, ‚ÄúYou participated in a brigade against this subreddit from another subreddit.‚ÄùHe then temporarily muted me, which is why I‚Äôm writing this post instead of replying through the ban message.This accusation of brigading is a flat out lie. I did nothing of the kind, nor did I encourage anyone to do so. Again, this is a lie and there‚Äôs no proof I participated in any brigade. (In fact, I believe it's against srcs rules to brigade, so even if I had done what is alleged, I would have been banned from there and so would many others who would have allegedly participated.)I‚Äôve been a Republican all my life, but I‚Äôve been treated very strangely on this sub recently. I‚Äôve just been trying to share my opinions/thoughts and haven‚Äôt acted inappropriately or broken any of the subreddit‚Äôs rules. If anything, I've been the one being attacked. I've also been dealing with supposedly being caught in a spam filter for who knows what reason.All I want to do is be able to participate, converse, and make a few jokes here and there. And I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs happened that‚Äôs making it so difficult to do that. It's almost seems like the mods are trying to drive away Republicans who are either moderate or don't fall in line with Trump, etc. (By the way, I consider myself a conservative in many ways.)I would respectfully request that my ban be lifted, or at least converted to a temporary ban of certain number of days, so I could again participate in the sub after that period of time.If it would would be necessary to say I would no longer participate in srcs, then I would also make that concession.Thank you.CC: u/Yosoff, u/DEYoungRepublicans, u/FixPUNK, u/The_seph_i_am, u/MikeyPhEdit: A couple of words. Howdy. I was recently banned from r/Republican for making a joke about a meme that I saw there. The meme format struck me as a bit cringy, so I noted that I thought the meme was from r/comedyhomicide. Apparently, this is considered 'heated debate' by the mods, because I was banned, and the reason was listed as rule 1, which says no heated debate. I messaged the mods, basically saying what I have above, and noted that I did it as a mockery of the meme format, not the message it sends. They simply muted me for 72 hours and repeated the rule 1 reasoning.Should I delete the comment in question to get unbanned?Thanks for the help. nan One of the first ones I'm considering is Roger StoneI Just finished that documentary on Netflix and for some reason I want to say he reminds me a lot like Raymond Reddington from blacklist. Except possibly more self centered and greedy.  Not really sure if that would be a good thing or not but he was heavily involved in a lot of republican administrations and could probably help smooth out certain connections.  But that man has absolutely nothing in the sense of morals.  However, it's not about my opinion, it's about the powers that be and what they want in this case.I'm actually considering doing a week long discussion thread on Roger Stone because he's actually a pretty fascinating political figure and has shaped republican politics for a long while.  Also, I want to see if there are any counter arguments to the he's the "most horrible sob in republican politics ever" as I'm not sure where the leftist slant ends and the actual facts begin with him.  If others would be interested please let me know.As someone like him is bound to draw a lot of hate I'll likely post a link to the thread on r/republican but post it on r/hindsightin2020 so certain *ahem* constraints are not at play, also one of the stated purposes of that sub is to discuss politics in a historical context so it seems like a better fit.So what say you all?Also, I'd like to start doing this once a month.  So if you have other republican figures (alive or dead) that have a documentary that others can watch and comment on please let me know so we can get a schedule running.  I can see this becoming something of a book club except for documentaries on historical figures.For people that were around for the "first hundred days in office thread" it would likely be in that same vein. nan If you're *really* having brigading problems and with drive-by republican-disrespect... go private and force registration through a message stating the following:* Political leaning* Intention (and acceptance of the rules)Examples (WITH SARCASM/LEVITY - I hate that I need to preface this):* Moderate, Casual observer, will not use votes or respond - accept my fate* Liberal, Respectful discussion - accept my fate* STUPID REPUBLICANS - SUCK ON TRUMPS TEET, SNOWFLAKES* Republican, Respectful discussion - accept my fate...Again... just examples... maybe slightly exaggerated.That creates a contract so that any member has to opt in and *consent* to any negative consequences.This prevents drive-by comments, brigading, and insulates the sub until things smooth over.Maybe it's been discussed between the mods... I don't know... but the series of events that have unfolded over the past months has been unfortunate. It's "easy" enough to pre-select some active users in the forum, but announcing early on the main forum would allow anyone to register before going private and they would be able to resume contributing with minimal effort.Maybe ask the sub to weigh in on options as well? I see a lot of good content in the Republican sub and many articles with plenty of discussion and no upvotes or even downvotes. Very rarely does a post from r/Republican break into my front page. We've got 24,000 subscribed members but very few posts ever get over 100 votes. Would like to hear from a mod why this is? Thanks!Edit: JK comments are now showing up. Ask your questions, to get the edges smoothed out.  Its an AMA workshop for the AMA for US senate candidate Pensen from Missouri next week. Hi,I discovered ['r/Republican'](https://np.reddit.com/r/Republican) a couple of months ago, and visit more and more often. I find it to be one of the more intelligent conservative subreddits, so thank you all for that.I feel the - somewhat cast-aside - concept of **'compassionate conservatism'** is what will save Republicans, and I say that as someone who probably leans further left than most debaters on ['r/Republican'](https://np.reddit.com/r/Republican).However, there appears to be no subreddit catering to 'compassionate conservatism'.I feel this is a grievous error, on our part.Does anyone know of one? If not, should one exist?I feel that there should be a place of news and discussion, where conservatives who are tired of being seen as "dumb" and "hate-filled" can go.**It should be a place where:** * Intelligence, education, higher-education, and even - yes - academia, are respected and encouraged. * Climate change, renewable energy, and planning for the long-term future, is looked at, positively. * Capitalism is recognized as the foundation of a successful country, but socialism is also seen as necessary to fix certain inherent flaws in capitalism. * People talk about 'The American Dream', the success and failures of their own personal 'American Dream', and how we can help recreate it and make it possible, once-again. * We aren't afraid to spend a little tax-payer's money giving people a helping hand. * The military is recognized as necessary, but it's size should be contained. * Prejudice against minorities is strongly discouraged. * Religious freedom is encouraged, but we attempt to behave the way Jesus would. * Traditional values - even old-fashioned ones - can be espoused, as long as they do not harm others. * We recognize that guns will always be part of our country - and should not be removed from us - but that restrictions on them are sometimes necessary, to try and prevent unnecessary deaths. * Buzz-terms like 'MSM', 'SJW', 'cuck', 'beta-male', 'triggered', and 'snowflake' are looked-down upon. * Brash, loud, misleading headlines are discouraged. * People's gullibility is pointed-out to them, and critical thinking is encouraged. * Policy and mindsets that are selfish and provoking are frowned-upon. * Compromise is seen as a necessity, on policy. * And above all, I hope it would be an environment that others aspire to replicate. nan Hey guys,I made this comment ( https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/6hkg6x/democrats_in_congress_sue_trump_over_foreign/dizhhy7/?context=3 ) and was subsequently banned for rule 5. I received a mod notification of the ban which stated I could message the mods about the ban and I did so, sending the following message:"Hey guys,I can see how that post could be seen as purely defensive of a leftist talking point. I did not mean for it to come across as such. I do take issue with the way Trump has handled things in that vein but I don't intend to disrupt the subreddit in the manner that I imagine this rule was created to prevent.I would be happy to delete the post if you find it fit to unban me.Thanks"I was quickly muted from sending further messages to the mod team.First, I can see how, as a new account, my posts would be treated with some scrutiny. I recently made a post on r/sysadmin and my post was put in the mod queue as they don't allow new accounts (24 hours or newer) to post freely. I get that and didn't send any complaint. However, the ban seemed like a rather strong reaction to me. I understand you may have your own circumstances on this subreddit so I attempted to explain myself in what I thought was a pretty polite manner but was muted. This seems harsh to me. I guess I feel like my post might be something that many liberals/Democrats would parrot, but I feel the same way about Republicans. I know others that identify as Republican that take issue with his business handlings in light of becoming the President. Am I truly that far off in that belief?Anyway, apologies if my post was disruptive. It's certainly up to the community to decide what is allowed so I won't make any judgments.   nan Hey folks, I just wanted to say thank you to all the people commenting and engaging in this Ask Republicans discussion.https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/6247rv/ask_republicans_why_keep_the_freedom_caucus/The conversation did help me tremendously to understand and shape my thoughts. From your responses and because it forced me to reexamine the political science data, I think the truth is that the conservative movement is the future of the party and it's a matter of time now for centrists.Unfortunately, as a consequence of that thread, I got banned from /r/Republican and I am unable to give my sincere thanks to those who responded to my question. I hope those who participated in that thread at least see my thank you here. The mods of /r/Republican have spent the several months since the Presidential election trying more lenient methods to ensure this subreddit would remain pro-Republican.  Those efforts and warnings have been largely ignored.The reasons for this new rule are simple.* Republicans should not be downvoted for making pro-Republican comments on /r/Republican.* Non-Republicans should not be upvoted for making anti-Republican comments on /r/Republican.This rule will be strictly enforced until the culture of this subreddit is restored to being pro-Republican.  After that is achieved we will loosen the enforcement.----**It is still okay to disagree with policy decisions.*** Example of a good comment: I disagree with Senator McCain's proposal to preemptively bomb Iran.* Example of a bad comment: McCain is a war mongering cold war era dinosaur.The first comment politely discusses policy the second comment speaks ill of a fellow Republican.----**President Trump is considered a Republican.**If you dislike President Trump either learn how to politely disagree based on policy or you will not last much longer on this subreddit. Was I banned because I am an atheist? To my understanding I never broke any of the rules; and if I did why was I given no warning. I've never crossed these mods before. I'm just confused about the whole situation. nan I didn't realize we aren't allowed to voice opposition on r/conservative and I got banned, so my question is, where can I go to debate conservatives ?  nan nan [**The Old Message:**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/6kxy6m/democrats_twice_as_likely_to_think_media_is_fair/djpn9ao/)> Hello, and welcome to /r/Republican. Please understand this subreddit's primary purpose is for Republicans to discuss issues facing the party. Out of respect for this sub's main topic, we ask that unless you identify as Republican that you leave the vote button alone. Non republicans who come to our sub looking for a 'different perspective' subvert that very perspective with their own views when they vote in a sub where they agree with very little. (It's like down voting a post in '/r/chocolate' because you don't like chocolate). We can gain 'other perspectives' by viewing the other left leaning political subs. We like our sub the way it is. Additionally, please ensure to follow our rules about leftist comments and anti-republican criticisms. We allow comments from non-republicans but we take our 6 rules very seriously.[**The New Message:**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/6kyufq/nearly_20_percent_of_rhode_island_voters_dont/djpteav/)> /r/Republican is a partisan subreddit. This is a place for Republicans to discuss issues with other Republicans. Out of respect for this sub's main purpose, we ask that unless you identify as Republican that you refrain from commenting and leave the vote button alone. Non republicans who come to our sub looking for a 'different perspective' subvert that very perspective with their own views when they vote or comment. I corrected a moderator about Giffords being shot by a leftist and was promptly banned because I correctly, and politely, claimed that the shooter's ideology more closely resembled a tea party extremist, rather than a leftist. I cited my source to that effect. The mod replied with another source which contains the following quote:> He fits better on the fringy right: Loughner and the far left both have anti-government views, says Mark Potok at the Southern Poverty Law Center. But when you study his bizarre internet paper trail, Loughner sounds more like a "right-wing extremist." His screeds against "currency that's not backed by gold" and government "mind control" through "controlling grammar" are the stuff of the conspiracy theorists in the far-right "Patriot" movement.Certainly there is a legitimate disagreement on this point, and I clarified that the shooting was due to mental illness, and not properly attributable to any particular political ideology.It seems to be clear that I wasn't banned for parroting leftist talking points, but rather because I happened to disagree with a moderator. This is not the purpose of Rule 5, which I don't see how I violated in any of my posting history.I know that this was a tense morning, with a politically motivated shooting targeting the party, but banning people who correct moderators is not productive. Perusing my posting history I think I have been a quality contributor to the subreddit and respectfully request that this ban be lifted. I don't mind a temporary ban for the 72 hour mute period. That's fine. I get that the mods probably had a worse morning than I can see and I don't mind them blowing off steam that way. However, an outright ban for stating what the mod's own source says is unreasonable and should be overturned. Thanks, Have a good day. The mods really need to get that sub under control I acknowledge my comment regarding Mitch McConnell was inappropriate; it was made in the heat of the moment. My history with /r/republican has been genuinely positive and it's generally been the political subreddit that I enjoy having discussions with people who are ideologically similar to mine, even though I am conservative democrat (formerly independent) and only diverge on some issues (like healthcare, retirement, women's rights, and some regulations).I apologize for my misconduct and it won't happen again. I submitted [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/621kc8/house_intelligence_panel_cancels_meetings_for_the/) linking to an article on The Hill about 10 minutes ago, and it appears to have been made immediately invisible on the sub. Is there a reason for that? Just noticed that my last two comments in r/Republican, one [defending a heartbeat abortion ban](https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/5nrtct/prolife_republicans_stronger_now_than_ever/dcgb007/) and one [calling out Democrats for freaking out over a lie from Keith Ellison](https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/5ntd5q/rand_paul_only_republican_to_vote_no_as_senate/dcgc6if/), are both hidden. The un-hidden post before that is me saying we should always hear Trump out no matter what we think of him, because [he's willing to say things other politicians aren't](https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/5ng8y7/fox_news_anchor_shep_smith_denounces_trump_for/dcc8rz5/). Specifically, I was praising Trump's advocacy for drug price negotiation at his press conference, arguing that it's good policy and would expose high level Democrats like Cory Booker who've been bought by big pharma. I turned out to be right about that btw. So what's the deal? The person I was talking to, u/cazort2, also appears to be shadow-banned, so was I accidentally banned when you were banning someone else? I've made it clear in the past that I'm a never-Trump Republican, but I don't see any post that would violate the rules. Plus, I've had pretty much only positive things to say about other Republican politicians and Republican policies, and negative things to say about Democrats. My two hidden comments happen to show that, but I could point to others.This sub has fewer memes and more substantive conversation than r/conservative. Mods, is there anything I could do to get back in? nan I love fiscal conservatism. Absolutely love it. I love states doing whatever they please, as long as it doesn't become discriminate. I don't love the news. Any of it. So some big parts of me are Republican leaning and certainly core values about how a country should be run. I was banned quite a while ago from the sub. I don't love Trump, and I don't love the increase in memes, turning it into something that more closely resembles /r/conservative. So could I be unbanned, and should I be? Do I still fit into the group of people the sub is aimed at? Who is the sub for anymore exactly? You know you're a place for free speech when you can someone for saying they have an opinion.  My first post yesterday was about Comey not saying Trump obstructed justice (Someone else has since posted it, the story from ABC thats like the 5th newest post).Today I submitted [this](https://www.google.com/amp/www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/06/07/comey-testimony-closely-coordinated-with-special-counsel-source-says.amp.html) and it was taken down.All I ask is why? I will not deny leaning liberal, and I probably pissed off /u/ibiteyou in particular, but I've been keeping an eye on the majority of politics based subreddits and this is the only one still having sane discussion and I would like permission to post and comment here again. If I end up getting rebanned I will not request another unbanning. I may not be a fan of Donald Trump and his administration, but it's no where near as bad as the caricature that /r/politics is creating.The current discussion on Russia made me snap a little bit. Unless  they hacked voting machines themselves (which there have been no grounded accusations of) then I do not believe they have delegitimized this election. I support the electoral college and Donald Trump is the President Elect. The liberals whining about it on /r/politics give the rest of us a bad name. Could you tell me why my submission on /r/republican got labeled as "Democratic Spam" and then removed? It didn't break any rules as far as I could tell, unless [the policy of allowing consciencious objection to Trump](https://4x.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/58hbar/attention_if_you_are_planning_on_voting_for/) has been retracted without notice. Nor was the piece written by a Democrat - quite the contrary, Ben Shapiro's about as conservative as they get.Referenced thread is here:https://4x.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/5fqscw/trumps_latest_picks_arent_draining_the_swamp/ I acknowledge my comment regarding Governor Pence was inappropriate.  I made a hot headed comment after a day of heightened tensions both on and off of reddit.   My history with /r/republican has not been controversial and it's generally been the political subreddit that I most align with in regards to political ideology.My apologies for my misconduct. The post in question: https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/58hbar/attention_if_you_are_planning_on_voting_for/Apparently, I was the one who can't "tolerate the existence of differing opinions".Let's see if they'll ban be me here too.EDIT: I though it's interesting that there are two other [removed] comments on that thread. When viewed in destroy mode anything with a link begins rapidly switching between font sizes making it damn near impossible to focus on comments.  It won't do it the main page unless you zone in.  But any comments page, it does this.  I think it has something to do with the CSS code but I'm no programmer so if anyone else knows a solution I'd be happy to hear it.  I see a lot of talk on here (republican and metaRepublican) about who is far right and who isn't. I think it's worth having a Subwide poll to see where people stack up. [The specific quiz I referenced in the title](https://www.isidewith.com/political-quiz) I was browsing in offline mode, and I noticed some of my posts don't appear. They haven't been downvoted (as far as I can tell), they just don't show up. Is there something I'm missing here?Thanks! Come on guys, this shit is blatant, you aren't fooling anyone...**Edit:** It was switched to "new" instead, which is fair. I can post but when I log out to see my comment, it's missing. Air grievances and or opinions regarding [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/56mihv/announcement_its_time_we_talked_about_what_we/) here please I'd like to be unbanned.  I can't find the thread that created my banning, and the mod that did it is no longer on reddit.  Here is a screenshot of our [conversation](http://imgur.com/a/GOoIH).  This gist of the thread was a few users were piling on the Girl Scouts because of a Soros influence in their handbook.  While I agreed the influence was not good, that the overall good the Girl Scouts did still made them a worthy organization (may daughter has been a GS for 10 years now).  That got me banned.   Please post meta discussion and subscriber feedback for /r/Republican. nan Discussion for post: https://old.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/8jc1sd/reminder_this_is_a_partisan_prorepublican/ For next week's AMA please post questions your wanting to ask but not sure how to here.  Mods will provide inputs as best we can and try to help guide you from violations of our rules. nan If you would rather have Judge Garland than Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, you will be banned.If you defend Democrats for filibustering Judge Gorsuch's nomination, you will be banned.If you attack Republicans for not bringing Judge Garland's nomination to a vote, you will be banned.This announcement is being made here instead of /r/Republican, because this is simply a clarification of Rule 4 enforcement for those who have already been banned.We want to ban as many anti-Republican leftists as possible to get them out of our subreddit for good. I messaged a couple of mods about this phenomenon in general, but I'm not sure it's been solved.

Or is it working itself out? I would like to be able to comment and post on r/Republican without having to check whether the comments/posts are actually showing up or being removed.

Is there some link between this change and ibiteyou's departure as a mod?Also interesting that two of the most prolific posters (ibiteyou and keypuncher) no longer seem to participate.  Was there some dustup behind the scenes? Hello. I was banned after [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/49zi9c/at_republican_debate_ted_cruz_nails_it_when_he/d0xiono) discussion. I was never given a specific reason, so I've assumed it must have been: (i) because I didn't blindly love Ted Cruz, (ii) I proved a now-former moderator wrong on a minor point, or (iii) some combination of one or both, done in a tone that the now-former moderator did not like. Been reading /r/republican since then, but don't have much to say anywhere else.Would love to be able to get back up on the horse, particularly in light of the changes that appear to have happened. nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan  - You have compared every Republican President since Reagan to a Nazi. - You have insisted that Republicans are about "white power."

You claim that shooter was just "mentally ill" while you ignore the documented mental illness of the Charlottesville killer that you bring up ALL THE TIME in order to imply that everyone on the right is violent. - Maxine Waters told people to harass members of the administration in their private lives and you cheered and defended her. - Ted Cruz, Mitch McConnell, Sarah Sanders among others were harassed while in public with their spouses and families and you celebrated. - Antifa went to Tucker Carlson's home, terrified his wife and kids and vandalized his property. - Protestors stood outside Mitch McConnell's home when he was recovering from a fall and screamed that they wanted to "murder turtle" and "stab McConnell in the heart" and you didn't bat an eyelid. - Major publications are running opeds encouraging the American people to overthrow the government and you are on board. - James O'Keefe shows you Bernie staffers talking about putting your neighbors in re-education camps and you suddenly think maybe it's a good idea and you try to get O'Keefe de-platformed for exposing it.You know, we on the right have been on to you for a long time.

The debate topic was "Resolved: The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce restrictions on legal immigration"In policy debate, the affirmative proposes a plan which falls under the resolution, and the negative rejects it. For example, many affirmatives remove the per-country limits on immigration. My partner and I were assigned the negative position, but our opponents did not read a plan. Instead, they performed a slam poem about citizenship and dehumanization.In response, we argued that they weren't actually an affirmative because they did not advocate a plan for the resolution, and that their strategy was unfair to negative positions.They then argued we could not talk about fairness because we were white males and had "caucasity".In response, we read a critique against identity politics utilizing quotes from Sam Harris, Ben Shapiro, and Jordan Peterson. We argue that our identity as white males shouldn't matter in the round; that our race and gender have nothing to do with what's right and wrong; That we should instead regard people as individuals. The judge then ends the round and disqualifies for making "racist and violent" arguments endorsed by "white supremacists."The debate space is a leftist echo chamber and it must be exposed.

You'll notice all the usual amongst them too, they often espouse "progressive" ideology but want full on blown communism which is the least "progressive" idea you could think of.Best ones are the ones you'll find on social media with the symbol of communism next to their username, the LGBT flag and bio that says they're against racism. I can only put it down to ignorance and not understanding actual communism seeing as the ideology, whereever is has been practiced, has been anti-gay and has discriminated not just on political identification but on race too. Look at Holodomor, the Soviet Union was more than happy to commit ethnic cleansing on the Ukrainians and rid society of "undesirables" like the disabled.Most seem to idolise the Soviet Union but hate Nazi Germany, acting as if they were completely different.

The party is one step closer to a major ballot access victory in Pennsylvania.  A state court judge has issued an order giving the legislative body one week to act on a pending ballot access bill, reducing the required number of signatures from 21,775 to 5,000 signatures.  If the legislators fail to act the judge will act for them.  Either action will place the party in favorable position to gain ballot access and claim another 20 electoral votes!Virginia and Ohio are also key sates where ballot access can also be achieved with 5,000 signatures!  Ohio, Virginia, and Pennsylvania have a combined total of 51 electoral votes.  Achieving ballot access in these three states would virtually ensure that the party would be on the ballot in enough states to exceed the 270 electoral vote threshold to win the presidency.To achieve this goal, your financial investment in the party is critical and is needed immediately.  **We do not have a single day to spare as ballot access petitions are time-sensitive.**  The ballot petition deadline in **Pennsylvania is August 1st**; in **Ohio, it is August 10th**; and in **Virginia, it is August 26th**.  At this point **we need as many volunteers as possible** and we will also need to bring in professional signature gatherers.  The expected cost for professionals to assist our efforts will run as high as $2.50 per signature, which translates into a total cost of $56,250.00.**I cannot emphasize enough the urgency and necessity of your most generous gift to our ballot access drive.**  [Your donation](https://secure.giftwrapplus.org/cpnc/eu/contribute/ballot-access.aspx)  of $5.00, $10.00, $25.00, $50.00, $100.00, $500.00 or more is critically needed.As in my previous pleas to you, I encourage you to forward this message on to your family members and friends of like mind, and encourage them to go to the national website and to learn of the party ‚Äì  [www.constitutionparty.com](http://www.constitutionparty.com/) .

I'll respond to any of them too. From Facebook:Dear Fellow Patriots:I want to address with you a concern that has been weighing on my mind since the November General Election As you now all know this was an election in which our delegates selected a candidate who came from within the ranks of the party. As a result the party did not have the luxury to draw on funds that came into the campaign in the past with the selection of an outside party candidate. This meant we were required to depend upon our own efforts to raise funds to gain ballot access and to promote our candidates. Had we been on the ballot in more states, they would have received many thousands of more votes.The Castles and other loyal party members worked tirelessly to generate the badly needed funds to gain ballot access and to promote our candidates. Few realize the hours that were spent to accomplish what they did. In all The Castle campaign raised less than $100,000.00 for this effort and the party was able to raise an additional $19,370.00 strictly for ballot access. Yet in spite of the limited funds that we raised, and getting on the ballot in two less states than in 2012, the number of votes polled by the Castle/Bradley team was a record 203,026 votes and that does not include states such as VA, AL, OR, NH and NE that did not tally any of the votes written in for our candidates. This is a remarkable feat to say the least and speaks volumes for those who gave their all to achieve that level of success. After the election we retained ballot access in the same number of states (12) as we did after the 2012 election. Those states are FL, SC, MS, MO, SD, WI, MI, ID, WY, NV, CO, and UT.The bottom line is that in order to build a viable party we must 1) Get on the ballot in many more states than we have in the past and 2) Run as many local candidates in local non partisan elections in the next four years as we possibly can. Yes, this will be a tremendous challenge, but it is the only way we are going to build a viable political party.Increasing our readership of the Howard Philips Legacy Society Newsletter can be a key to achieving these goals. This is a newsletter that all of our national, state and local county leaders should be subscribing to. In fact all of our members should be getting it. The monthly donations range from $7.00, $12.00, $20.00, $30.00, $50.00 and $75.00 with variouspremiums given out at each level. I have attached the application for you to review. Currently we have just under 90 people who are either currently subscribing or who had subscribed during the past year. If just 20 party members in each of the 38 states where we have active leadership subscribed to the newsletter each month at the lowest premium level of $7.00 that would provide a steady monthly income of $5,320.00. If they selected to subscribe at the $12.00 level that would bring in $9,120.00 That would provide us with a viable source of income that we could begin our ballot access efforts immediately in a number of states. We already have work progressing in Alabama, Indiana, Hawaii, Virginia, Louisiana and Maryland.Fellow patriots, this is doable, but it is going to require the support of each of our state and national leaders. Each state officer, every national committee member and all of our executive committee members ought to be subscribing to the newsletter. Then too, there are hundreds of new people brought into the party through the Castle campaign that need to be contacted and given a personal invitation by you to subscribe. Current leaders in this effort are Wisconsin, Texas, Pennsylvania, Colorado and New York. I am asking that each of you National, state and local leaders sign up for the newsletter today and that you in turn ask your fellow state and county officers to do so as well as each of your national committee members.

Please follow up on this without delay.Just imagine what doubling the number of states we have ballot access in by the end of 2017 would do for the party's growth and image. Then if we increased that number again by 12 the General Election of 2018 we would be ballot qualified in 36 states! Working together we can do this, but the commitment has got to begin with our party leaders. I ask that each of you take this challenge seriously.

The Constitution Party effort to gain ballot access in North Carolina exceeded the required number of registered voter signatures to qualify for ballot access in 2018 and 2020. News of our success was picked up by U.S. News and World Report, a major newspaper in Raleigh, North Carolina, and other papers in that state. In addition, a popular radio talk show host interviewed our North Carolina state chairman, Al Pisano. The interview was deemed a tremendous success and was well received by the listening audience.Obtaining ballot access in Hawaii, and now North Carolina has brought more favorable publicity to the national party than any other activity that we have undertaken, especially in an off\-year election. It conveys to the public that we are not only serious about building a viable political party but also successful in doing so. Being recognized for our success in North Carolina by U.S, News and World Report is something I would never have thought possible.What the North Carolina party leadership and their group of volunteers accomplished is nothing short of amazing. In all, they turned into the county clerks a total of over 16,300 signatures. Of that number, 15,938 have been processed thus far and 12,537 have been determined as valid. The validity rate was 78.6&#37; which is most remarkable. That number gives us a cushion of over 600 signatures over the 11,925 valid signatures that are required. All of this was accomplished since mid\-December which is a very short time frame.This is the first time ever that the Constitution Party has qualified for ballot access in that state. Our sincere thanks go out to our state party leaders, Al Pisano and Kevin Hayes, for their incredible leadership in this undertaking. In addition, our sincere thanks are extended to Nicholas Sumbles, our sole paid petitioner who collected 10,000 signatures, and to the numerous volunteers who collected the remaining 6,000 plus signatures. When we first undertook this effort, no one really expected us to accomplish what was considered unattainable, especially in such a short period of time.Last but not least, our sincere thanks go out to our many supporters who donated month after month to the ballot access effort. Without your steady flow of monthly donations, we could never have accomplished what we did. Your faithful donations made it possible to keep Nicholas out in the field gathering signatures week after week. Know that your financial support is deeply appreciated. Give yourselves a good pat on the back!Success in North Carolina has now made it possible for us to focus on yet another state and that state is Wisconsin. As many of you know, we already have ballot access in that state. However, in order to maintain ballot access for 2020, we need to run at least one statewide candidate this year and that candidate needs to garner at least one percent of the vote cast for that office. That is very doable and Wisconsin hopes to field two such statewide candidates this year. In order to do that we have one serious hurdle that we must overcome. **The state requires that to run for any statewide office, a candidate must collect the signatures of 2,000 Wisconsin residents that are at least 18 years old. They do not need to be registered voters, but simply Wisconsin residents.**Andrew Zuelke is gathering signatures to get on the ballot for State Treasurer and Terry Larson is seeking to be on the ballot for Attorney General. They and party members have been gathering signatures. Andrew has collected over 500 signatures and Terry has gathered 367. Volunteers continue to gather more, but I have been so preoccupied with gaining ballot access in North Carolina that I have not been able to follow up on the signature gathering effort in Wisconsin as I would have liked to.This is where we again ask for your help. We have just two weeks left before the June 1st deadline to turn in the signatures. I am therefore asking that if you live in Wisconsin, or have like\-minded family or friends in that state, you contact Andrew Zuelke at constitutionpartyofwisconsin@gmail.com or call him at 920\-748\-7296. He can provide a petition for you to sign or direct you to someone who can get your signature. **Time is of the essence; we need your help if we are to succeed.**Failure to get the required number of signatures to get them on the ballot will result in the party losing ballot access for 2020. If ballot access is lost, the party will need to gather 10,000 signatures to regain ballot access in 2020. Therefore, it is simply critical that we secure the balance of needed signatures to put both men on the ballot this year. **Please act immediately as time is of the essence.**If you are able to support the ballot access effort financially, please do so by going to our website and using the [Ballot Access](https://constitutionparty.nationbuilder.com/ballot_access?e=d80266c41423adede419e55b56715243&utm_source=constitutionparty&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2018_5_21_nc_wi_ballot&n=1) donation option, or you may donate by check using this [printable form](https://constitutionparty.nationbuilder.com/r?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.constitutionparty.com%2Fassets%2FHPLS-Constitution-Party-Victory-Fund.pdf&e=d80266c41423adede419e55b56715243&utm_source=constitutionparty&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2018_5_21_nc_wi_ballot&n=2).

Their deadline is August 1.Additionally, the Constitution Party has now qualified two statewide candidates in Wisconsin to be on the ballot in November. As the Constitution Party candidates will be facing off against only Democrats and Republicans, it is almost certain that they will receive enough votes for Wisconsin to have ballot access in 2020.The Constitution Party is now on target to have ballot access in 20 states by year end. New Mexico is the Constitution Party‚Äôs next apparent target. To qualify there, New Mexico activists reportedly must get a minimum of 500 more signatures by June 28.

Hey guys, just wanting to let you know that if GJ wasn't running, Castle would probably have my vote. But there's two main issues preventing me from going with him:1.) Castle literally has no way to win. He's not on enough state ballots. Gary is on all 50 state ballots and is the premier anti-Trump and anti-Clinton candidate. I don't believe in the lesser of two evils argument, but not being on enough ballots to conceivably win is where I draw my line. So for 2020, you guys need to ratchet up your ballot access drives a la what the LP has done this cycle.2.) Castle is too hardcore on the social issues. It's why candidates like Rick Santorum and Ted Cruz never made it past the primaries. I'm a Christian libertarian, so I'm more socially conservative than most libertarians but much more socially liberal than most conservatives (if that makes sense). Nobody in this election cycle is caring much about the issues Castle is hammering hard. He needs to be going after the issues voters care about this time - namely, the economy and security. I'm not saying to change your beliefs, but just change your emphasis.Good luck in 2016, and maybe better luck next time in 2020 CP. I'm a libertarian-leaning independent who's willing to look at all my options. So in 2020 I may be going with you guys over the LP depending on if you don't nominate a nut job ;) nan nan nan First, hi, I'm on the fence for the 2016 presidential election and am seriously considering Castle. Can we discuss this point please? Are there also other similar points in regards to the First Amendment? nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE CASTLE 2016 CAMPAIGN: In the past 6 days, because of your boots on the ground and your financial support, 8500 signatures were gathered in the state of Ohio and turned in to election officials today. Now we wait until 5000 signatures are verified valid and there are no legal challenges. When we have certification that Darrell Castle and Scott Bradley will be officially on the ballot in Ohio, we will let you know.Ballot access is not over until its over and we still have a month to go of gathering signatures in the final few states. Please send a donation now! Remember that all donors between Monday and Friday at midnight will be invited to a Special Conversation with Darrell online next Tuesday evening. Here is the donate link: https://castle2016.nationbuilder.com/donate nan nan Message from Ohio CP State ChairmanAll,I just received a call from Frank Fluckiger, the National Constitution Party Chairman. The Castle campaign in conjunction with the National Party is committed to getting Castle ‚Äì Bradley on the ballot in Ohio as Independent candidates for President and Vice President. As such, they will be providing additional resources from outside Ohio to ensure that we get the needed 7500 signatures filed by the August 10 deadline. If you would like to help ensure they are on the ballot, you can do the following:*  Continue to gather signatures and mail them to the CP of Ohio PO Box (PO Box 5, Eaton, OH 45320) to ensure that I have them by August 9 to deliver to the Statehouse. The forms can be downloaded / printed from the CP of Ohio website:http://www.cpofohio.org/help-castlepetitions.htmlIn addition, the website contains detailed instructions on how the forms must be filled out and completed to be valid. Please be sure you follow them completely.* Donate to Ballot Access on the national website ‚Äì www.constitutionparty.com. Even if you do not have a lot of time to devote to gathering signatures, hopefully you can help give voters a choice in the upcoming election by giving to the Ballot Access on the national website to help National provide for the outside signature gatherers. Please do that now as National needs to know how much they can count on the CP members and others from Ohio to help fund ballot access in Ohio.*   Provide housing if you are able for the signature gatherers being provided by National. This will reduce the ballot access cost that will be incurred if they must stay in hotels. It would be particularly helpful if you live near a large city / population center as that is going to be the most efficient place for them to maximize their signature gathering efforts.  *  Encourage others to help. Email your friends and family to be sure and sign a petition or even work to gather signatures on their own. If nothing else, a husband and wife and / or close family can sign petitions within the family and mail them in. JUST REMEMBER, that a person CANNOT SIGN his own petition. However, a husband and wife can print two petitions and each witness the other‚Äôs signature on separate petitions. Just follow the detailed instructions on the website and mail the signed petitions with the bottom of the page properly filled out to the P.O. Box. Even if there are two sheets with only one signature on each page, it counts. Of course, I would rather have sheets with multiple signatures but I will take what you give me. Encourage others to do the same.*   Pray! Pray to God for guidance, wisdom, and mercy in these perilous times. *  Please let me know what you are able to do, or plan to do so that I can inform National such that they know how much help to provide.Don Shrader, Chairman330-400-3444"Always vote for principle, though you may vote alone, and you may cherish the sweetest reflection that your vote is never lost." ~John Quincy Adams~[Link to petition page.](http://www.cpofohio.org/help-castlepetitions.html) nan nan nan nan Hi there! So, this is a legit question, because I'm really interested in signing up to this political party and maybe even in the future run for office in my community under its principals. One thing I am questioning is the stance on same sex marriage. Can someone please give me a little insight into the view of the party on the LGBT community. My family is directly linked to the the LGBT community. I feel strongly about equality for all Americans regardless of sexuality and I really am finding myself connecting deeply with the party as a whole.  I suppose my question is centered on ammendment XIV section 1 "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." How can the C.P. (is this a used abbreviation btw) not support same sex marriage and still be able to hold true to the constiturion? Is it simply a definition issue? I sincerely am interested, I have been searching for this party for a long time it seems and this is the only issue I find myself questioning. Thank you my future brothers and sisters!! nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan [**New information about Ohio ballot access.**](https://vr2.verticalresponse.com/emails/17592186092903?social_account_id=858488947555160&sk=a4ooB2JgQjBIH0DdVAO8F5JWg0IbmhlUOqbg8_xGMeAA=/aHR0cDovL3ZyMi52ZXJ0aWNhbHJlc3BvbnNlLmNvbS9lbWFpbHMvMTc1OTIxODYwOTI5MDM_c29jaWFsX2FjY291bnRfaWQ9ODU4NDg4OTQ3NTU1MTYw/ruEt-SGKIqRwkVmYaGMCBA==)  Please volunteer if you can in any way. nan Since I couldn't get the mods to respond at all, I created a new subreddit for the promotion of [Darrell Castle](https://www.reddit.com/r/castleforpresident/)Please see here for future news updates. nan nan nan nan nan nan We need to spruce up this subreddit.

Due to the corruption, incompetence and outright felonious mindset of the members of the fbi/cia, all of the other intel arms of the USA government are unable to protect the country from the mounting threats by persons and countries who seek to stop this nation's assault on Humanity.

It is pure folly to think that the unskilled labor that will be replaced by automation will all somehow go on to do other work that is both productive to society and self-supporting. We are about to end up with an unemployment problem like we have never seen and the time to do something about it is now, before it becomes a problem.Step 0: Free, government provided permanent and semi-permanent (IUD, implant, etc) birth control for anyone who wants it. Programs to encourage young people to get it done. We should be doing this anyway.Step 1: Receiving government benefits due to lack of income? Fine, but you can't vote while you are drawing those benefits or for 2 years afterwards. Voting should be reserved for members of society that produce value.Step 2: Drawing benefits because you can't afford to care for your child? Mandatory IUD for the mom, and semi-permanent BC for the dad. Have another kid afterwards and still need support? Get those tubes tied first.At some point, once the population starts to shrink, we will have to close off immigration to all but the most qualified people, as we will have plenty of people freed up from tedium to devote themselves to more productive work.I'd take it a step up and say you have to have a permit to be able to have a child, but I know that is drastic. However I definitely think we should have a population freeze and even give tax returns for every year a person of age doesn't have a child up to like 40 or something.

So yeah I Don‚Äôt get it either r/dndmemes Nah he‚Äôs had a following for longer than that.  Guys been around for a really really long time Imagine a city, one giant, massive city built in the remains of a kingdom that failed to withstand the tarasque.  The founders of this city put it this way,‚ÄúA long time ago... we were at war.  We were at war within our races, our houses and even our families... we were are war with others... we warred against other races, religions and nations.  Then the Tarrasque came.  It did not care about the color of your skin; whether you were rich or poor; strong or weak; good or evil; plant, animal, dirt or otherwise.  We were food.  It proved an unstoppable force, and devoured all but the dregs of us.  Then, as quickly as it appeared, it left leaving many scar across this land.‚Äù‚ÄúDwarven Scholars tell us the tell, that the the chances of the Tarrasque returning to the same location as it has already fed are actually 1,000% more unlikely than if we‚Äôre to move elsewhere.  To that end we will build here a new home, a new family, and a new nation.  Let this tragedy have a silver lining in that it finally allows us to simply live better.  Better with our brother, better with our kin, better with our neighbor. ‚Äú‚ÄúLet us build a nation... not of a single ideal, but of all the ‚Äúleftovers‚Äù because  that is what we are, leftovers.  We will open ourselves to those who simply want to let bygones be gone.  Where archaic ideals such as ‚Äúsuperiority‚Äù and ‚Äúweakness‚Äù are replaced with ‚Äúrespect‚Äù,  ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù, and ‚Äútolerance‚Äù.  A city where we are truly ourselves.‚Äù- Hollylove Homeforger(Founding Rock Gnome Mayor of the City of the Nine realms)This was 500 years ago. In that time the city has grown to absurd size.  It takes a full week of walking to reach one side to the other.  Most use either airship or waterways to travel from one side to the other.  The city is home to nearly any refugees culture you can imagine.  Not bound by traditional good or evil alignments, the city is divided up into nine realms based on the four lenses personality traits.Spoilers follow: so if you are part of my campaign the rest is about to be ruined.There were five city founders.  Each one of them realized that the Tarrasque decided to begin its dormancy period directly under their new city‚Äôs center.  Through the advice of a ‚Äúpeer‚Äù Homeforger discovered a hex dubbed the ‚Äúhex of ages‚Äù by using a combination of elven high magic techniques, necromancy and chronomancy that will give up some of a person‚Äôs remaining time and transfer it to a different user, thereby extending the recipients life time without causing someone to become Lich.  She then theorized that if you were to take a small amount of time from an entire kingdom and give it to the Tarrasque periodically.  You could effectively keep the Tarrasque in stasis indefinitely effectively saving not just the city but the entire planet from the Tarrasque.The secret part of a stadium where the spell takes place is guarded by a sphinx who has become jaded over the centuries watching this spell get cast every hundred years or so decides to do something about it.The campaign begins, after the party is recruited by a sphinx as a test of courage.  This happens to every the day of a great sports festival. During the festival the sphinx teleports the party to different planes and eventually teleports the part to a point extremely high above the city outside the rage of the spell.  The party watches as the hex is cast and a purple light with glowing rune circles cover the city.  It covers everyone the PCs have ever known or loved.  The sphinx turns to the party and says, ‚Äúyou have 40 days to undue this, or the effects become permanent‚ÄùThe party then goes of a quest for nine magical chronomancy based items that when brought together can undue the hex, returning the stolen time to where it belongs be force to watch as everyone the know and love age and die twice as fast as they should.  However, near the end of the campaign, the party discovers, that if they do this, the Tarrasque will awaken and feed once again on the city.  The nagpa comes into play as ‚Äúthe peer‚Äù that set Homeforger on this inevitable path of destruction in the first place.  Originally, this was going to be a green hag pulling the strings but a nagpa would have every motivation to bring this magnificent city to the ground as there is a university and a library that holds tombs and magical books from nearly every race imaginable.  Causing the collapse of this civilization would mean it could potentially glean ALL that magic, including this hex of ages.All that has to happen is either the hex takes TOO MUCH TIME as it did during this casting or they stop casting it and the party undoes the spell and the Tarrasque awakens hungrier than it has ever been in the history of DND having slumbered for over 500 years instead of the 40 months or so it normally does.  It might just consume a quarter of the planet at that rate.   Wouldn‚Äôt that be something... yes? All that precious magic from all those collapsed civilizations?  hmmmMmmmmmmmMmmmmmMmmmMmmm!?Also gnomes are basically gelflings so this really works God I wish we could move to [preferential ranked choice voting](https://www.reddit.com/r/hindsightIn2020/comments/4mf5po/preferential_rank_voting_explained/)We would have likely of had Kasich/Cruz vs Bernie as nominees from the 2016 elections if we could have used ranked choice Apologies for posting this so late.

The rise in popularity of Bernie Sanders following the McCain Obama presidential race and the increase in mobile users to Reddit.  After that point, I started noticing less civil discussion increasing.  The push was gradual at first but as more and more users flooded it became easier and easier to find uncivil disagreements So is it possible that with the increase in lifespan expediency and the delay in adults moving out of their parents safety net, that maybe the point of when someone is successful in the their career is also delayed?That said, another statement in the article.> conservative populism[Huh](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/ieLlh4r/comment/249710047)[Populism](https://youtu.be/gQcRibGhhSg) (as I understand the definition) and conservative principals aren‚Äôt usually simpatico.

I only heard the last two items.  After that it was ‚Äúpraise Trump this, and praise trump that‚Äù. I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh at how much he was praising the guy. > But that Sanders‚Äô national proposal probably won‚Äôt or can‚Äôt be implemented doesn‚Äôt mean his reasoning won‚Äôt damage housing policy across the country. His claim that landlords can charge ‚Äúwhatever they want‚Äù entrenches the idea that rents are set through greed or market power, not supply and demand.This is a key aspect here.  The ‚Äúlate stage capitalism‚Äù crowd is growing more and more vocal.  It‚Äôs low hanging fruit for his base to eat up. Would love it if the senate called on witnesses.  I think it would be fair if the Republicans could call on the same the number of witnesses as the Democrats and then the president, as the accused, could call on the same number as well.This ensures the Dems have incentive to call on the fewest but most impactful witnesses and doesn‚Äôt cause this thing to drag on into October.  The President would still be offered a chance to defend the witnesses statements with his own witnesses and thus we get a fair impeachment trial.

Good night Thanks for doing this!

I will have them make constitution checks to tell them whether it was mutually enjoyable but I usually keep it as vague as possible, as I get pretty  skeeved out by it.  Having to explain pretty much anything beyond... ‚Äúwell... YOU had a good time... she... well not so much...‚Äù  > All the guys at the table laugh.I know it‚Äôs part of the fun for people to be able to play out different plot lines and see where they fall and it‚Äôs literally one of the suggested faults on dnd beyond for paladins (lusty) it‚Äôs still something that seems kinda distracting to the main plot.It‚Äôs fine if there‚Äôs an emotional connection and the relationship makes sense to the plot but the ‚Äúhook up with random chick you met ten seconds ago at a bar because you happened to get lucky‚Äù aspect is kinda annoying...As a guy, I feel like I would end up being thought of as less than if I let my players know how weird it makes me feel. So I put on my best acting face; Let them play out the situation and just pray they‚Äôre rolls that don‚Äôt require me to go into too much detail...Thinking  about it... if my wife was the one trying to bang one of my NPCs I honestly wouldn‚Äôt know what the hell to think either.  It‚Äôs be somewhat exciting... but also embarrassing.  In a way, it‚Äôs flirting  but I‚Äôd be honestly more worried about the other players in the room, thinking Me and her were trying to roll play sexy time in front of them.  (Ain‚Äôt nobody in my group want to visualize that)... that said... that means my wife would actually be playing so... win?  (Best I can get her to do is 5 minute dungeon... can‚Äôt even get her to play video games...)Anyway, just wanted to see if female DMs ever had these issues. Makes you realize how much has gone on doesn‚Äôt it?Also, we need another Ninja game As a female DM, how do you handle players that want to bone every moderately attractive female NPC they encounter?Do you feel pressured to let them get further than they should for the sake of keeping them entertained in the story? That‚Äôs not a real solution.  Shitty streaming through a phone an‚Äôt exactly what I‚Äôm aiming for... also that doesn‚Äôt really work with the current set up. It has always been a point of frustration for me that there is no way for me to legally stream spirited away on Amazon, Netflix, iTunes etc.  hopefully this may change... Now, if Vizio could just stream disney plus.... This is the leftist version of gay conversion therapy Yes? I‚Äôm a fan of the age 26 argument due to the scientifically proven fact that you don‚Äôt reach mental maturity until that point. The next seconds after this is also quite accurate.  The DM gently pushes the party over to the plot hook....Shut up! I‚Äôm not railroading. <glances Around nervously>. It‚Äôs not rail roading if ... if... they had other options and they choose the ‚Äúright one‚Äù!Yes I did only give them fairly instant doom alternatives.

Thank you! > Those responsible for the strike on the plane would be prosecuted, the statement added.And would be made to disappear forever Well if it barters with night Hags then it doesn‚Äôt even need to judge them...  just saying.https://youtu.be/6SXfrT7-h2s Not necessarily, there‚Äôs some who have lichdom forced upon them.  They can become demilich under the right circumstances... in theory.There are two videos id like you to consider.https://youtu.be/CK33lDfJjKI https://youtu.be/AFvNF7VMXOA Thank you for this.  Often times, I am at a loss for words in the heat of things.  Sometimes I‚Äôll end up saying things that in hindsight weren‚Äôt that great. having this would have saved me some embarrassing impromptu moments.My favorite phrase I have used is thus far.A player asked ‚Äúwell is he embarrassed enough to run?‚ÄùGive me an insight check‚Äú18‚Äù‚ÄúNo, in fact it‚Äôs the exact opposite.  You have caused this man to seethe with rage.  You could live for a hundred years and never encounter someone who hates you more than this man.  He will have dreams of desecrating your floppy, mutilated, corpse in ways unimaginable by demons.  This man has become so enraged with you that he will haunt you after his death.‚Äù‚ÄùGenerations of his offspring will be born hating both you and your descendants and not even know why. He turns to his 9 remaining thugs, points to you and states ‚Äúwhoever brings me that man‚Äôs scrotum for a coin purse will have as much extra gold as you can fit in it‚ÄùNow hear me out, the player had it coming.This was after the player had done the following:- Cursed the bandit Captian with only being able to see dark vision- Held the bandit captain as a human shield as his men lobbed several arrows into him.- Pulled down the bandit captains pants to make a quick escape to higher ground and to (and I quote) ‚Äúfurther embarrass the goon‚Äù- Lobbed a fur ball (from a bag of tricks) that landed in the  bandit captian‚Äôs pants as he was pulling up his pants, causing the mastiff that was to attack the spawned to attack the ‚Äúeasiest target‚Äù using bite.  The bandit made short work of the mastiff.- This only inspired the player to lob a second bag of tricks ball, which summoned a lion. The player demanded that the lion also attack the same place.  It was only after this, he asked the question. I‚Äôm a simple man.  I see tremors and I upvote. Ya know that question sometime people ask to get to know you better.  The one where they ask ‚Äúif you won the power-ball billion dollar jackpot, what would you spend it on?‚ÄùI used to say after some donations to various charities, cancer and enough to live off of, I would invest in making electronic flying vehicles that could be purchased for $40,000 a thing and space tech.  Specifically, space mining, colonization, and realistic approaches to intergalactic travel.But now, I know what I‚Äôd spend it all on.  This. Congratulations! The entire world and the benefits it would have reaped from such investments can suck it! Because this needs to be the definitive version of ric and morty.The uncanniness is the perfect balance of unsettling and surreal, playing so well with the shows themes of ugly truth while still making them feel so fun and fully realized.  I hope the creators see this and say... for one episode let‚Äôs just try it.Well done, you did good... even if you did doom humanity‚Äôs progression. At least they waited until after christmas...  just in time for tax season. I was just reading about the new priorities on their discord.That‚Äôs unfortunate for the crew. Guess there won‚Äôt be more troopers episodes.  That was an expensive show I‚Äôm gonna stay because I still rewatch bloodkeep and such.However, I am not naive enough to think that they are gonna survive something like this, without extreme difficulty.  This has a movie pass vibe all over it.That said, you have given me hope.  Also, being able to download D20 would be a very good day indeed.All the same, I really wanted to see Lou and Mike be on the same DND campaign That‚Äôs unfortunate, I paid for dropout just because of shows like dimension 20 and troopers.  The sketches have been missing the mark for me, but the crowds and community around fantasyhigh is insane to me.There 2,664 users on the dimension 20 discord room as I type.  You can‚Äôt be on there unless you have dropout.  (Which was a couple bucks a month until recently... when I subscribed it was 5).  There live events are always a packed house.  And they sell merch like no tomorrow.Was collegehumor proper that much of a money pit?Edit:  there are 13,000 members on the server proper.  That‚Äôs gotta account for something?! Fantasyhigh got me into DND.  Escape from the blood keep is a fantastic story.Brennan is an incredible DM the cast was great.  And I truly don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do my morning runs now that I don‚Äôt have this show to listen to.  The owners of college humor have made a terrible mistake here. No more dimension 20?I don‚Äôt want to live on this planet any moreNo seriously this makes no damn sense.  That series is incredible and was extremely lucrative.  Just... what the hell?Edit:  Correction, apparently D20 and Drawfee will still be a thing as they are relatively cheap to produce.  Brennan has been retained and the only questionable person on the D20 cast is Ally but it seems like she may be okay... maybe... Now did you end up buying it after or before she unwrapped this ‚Äúgift‚Äù?(Asking because I have definitely seen something similar happen when my dad bought kitchen knifes For their anniversary.... two hours later, we were shopping for a new ruby ring for my mom) Yes, no, not that I can tell.I have questioned him several times about how he added things up but they usually end up correct.  He does get low rolls occasionally.  But now that you mention it, in between rolls, he‚Äôll do this odd thing, where he just rolls for no reason between his turns.  The dude has serious ADHD sometimes so I just chalk it up to him being bored.  In theory, he could be evening out the odds, rolling lows in between turns. We‚Äôre sorry we‚Äôre ‚Äúcomfortably numb‚Äù by this point. Yeah they don‚Äôt but through sheer dumb luck he keeps winning out.  I‚Äôm waiting for the wild magic user to get so pissed at him that he just throws his ass of the airship from 400 feet up but that damn ring of feather falling... Oh we‚Äôve been having fun with him.  So there was one time where they had to smuggle magical items into the city.  The local thieves guild is the only ones that can get the stuff in.  Especially, since the citywatch fighter didn‚Äôt want to give up his items to his bosses...The thieves guild wasn‚Äôt too keen on helping the party the second they learned that he was citywatch.... so...the wild magic user in the party suggests that the thieves guild smuggle him and all his stuff so he doesn‚Äôt learn the drop location.  Of course the fighter tired to fight it.  > okay give me opposed athletics... ‚Äú19! Ha ha!‚Äù> cool you manage to fight off the first 5 of them.  But the remaining 10 half-ogres the thrive guild keeps on hand for such a dilemma manage to subdue you.I still fight on... > (fighter‚Äôs players name) look at me... this is happening.  You can‚Äôt fight it.  No amount of rolls will save you here.‚ÄúFine but hands off my stuff!‚Äù> They then tie you up and drag you to the back room with a burlap sack tied over you head. (So he couldn‚Äôt figure out how the thrive guild was getting into the city.  From this point on, anytime, I‚Äôd make an attempt from the thieves guild to swipe his stuff he‚Äôd successfully make nat 20 saves.  Three in a row I couldn‚Äôt fucking believe it). I played it as follows:> somehow, despite being in the equivalent of a straitjacket, blindfolded and in a full body sized bag, you feel someone going for your coin purse and rusty bag of tricks. You then flipped over and bite them holding on to your stuff with all your might.  (I insisted on a successful perception with disadvantage, two opposed athletics (also disadvantage), and just straight dumb luck check... 19‚Äôs and 20‚Äôs the whole time).  > Now, give me constitution saving throws to see if you don‚Äôt drown. ‚ÄúWhat?!  I‚Äôm being drowned?  Am I behind a boat? Why?‚Äù > You bit your curriers and they want to make sure you can‚Äôt figure out where they are and the route they smuggle goods on. (By this point the players are in tears laughing... all except the fighter whose getting slightly pissed.)Sigh... ‚Äú18!‚Äù> Well you don‚Äôt drown.. you manage to dolphin kick you way to the surface.  There‚Äôs still a burlap sack over you head and breathing feels like being water boarded... but you manage to somehow survive.  You arrive on the other side the city walls.  You have no idea how got there.  You remember water, and then being dragged behind a cart for what seemed like miles.  But your memory seems hazy and if placed on a spell.  The rest of the party is there waiting for their stuff that the thieves guild smuggled in for them.  You‚Äôre picked up and dropped like a sack of potatoes next to the loot.  ‚ÄúHe gave us sum trouble getting here so we had to give him a bath‚Äù you hear a voice say.  The party then picked up their stuff and begins to leave you there.‚ÄúI still have my stuff right?‚Äù> give me one more perception and an opposed athletics check ‚Äú19 and 17‚Äù he says with a grin ear to ear... > I let out the most defeated sigh...‚Äùyes... you still have your stuff‚Äù (‚ÄúI‚Äôll get you next time Damn it‚Äù I say under my breath)‚ÄúI beg them not to leave me and at least cut my ropes so I can get back home.  I pay them!‚ÄùThe party debated for 10 minutes and finally decided to do so only after he agreed to pay them each 50 GP and one guy 500GP for some shinanagins that happened earlier.So like I said.  He‚Äôs a source of entertainment.  They‚Äôre a consistent show and bring a lot of humor and fun. If I had more regular players... maybe...Additionally, due to this solely being people from work: this has to remain ‚Äúopen to all‚Äù.  So this doesn‚Äôt become ‚Äúexclusionary‚Äù. I‚Äôm doing this my next campaign 33% * Does that mean he has to visit Europe? A great video for both you and u/tricares_Bitch to considerIs this ted talk in infinite game theoryhttps://youtu.be/0bFs6ZiynSUAfter that, there‚Äôs a great playlist about Iran and what and why we are hostile towards them (if you have a few hours).  [Here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3N9QD4_yI-Dq9EXLpdtNCN6dGyNPGdGi) beyond that.  I have no opinion on the if and buts of Vietnam and Korea.  We‚Äôve reached an age where those tactics are less relevant.  Gulf storms and Kosovo, is probably the best comparisons to what we would initially expect followed by prolonged insurgencies.  Though without a bordering country to train, supply, and recruit fighters (which is what Iran did for both iraq and Afghanistan... it would be only slightly more difficult... but definitely not improbable).The phase 1, 2 would be easy the phases following... that‚Äôs the tricky part. Is that why student loans are forever? This is the most accurate example of Modern ISR I can think of.  Completely overt collection but it still somehow works. Lol (Nervous laughter)like there‚Äôs gonna be a room for him to play in... we‚Äôll be sleeping in bunkers by that point silly.(God, I hope I‚Äôm joking) Mainly airforce and marines.  Some army play but my experience it‚Äôs mainly Air Force and marines Any chance they‚Äôll push out an actual app or is chromcast all we‚Äôre getting? Some People gonna need to learn how to play DND through Skype. DND version of that time I got reincarnated as a slime?If that thing has great sage and predator perks bow down before it now. Well...this should make up for the downed drone. After a few days I think I‚Äôve come up with a semblance of an idea.  Change ‚Äúimpact‚Äù In ‚Äúaction; impact‚Äî- result‚Äù to ‚Äúhow well they did it‚Äù.Ask Did they build consensus?Did they plan out how they would execute the process? Was the plan successful?These should be the focus of leadership bullets but they typically get scrapped because ‚Äúimpact‚Äù Is more sexy and easier to define.I agree with u/harlanwade90 on most points expect one, I don‚Äôt necessary agree with not trying to make every airman a Chief.  An adage that has served my units well is you train your replacement better than you were trained.  Unfortunately it is very hard to predict who will stay in and who won‚Äôt.  If you are not hedging you bets and making each airman the best potential NCO they can be, then we are not preparing the future for success.  That said, I do agree with the spirit of what they are saying.  Don‚Äôt write someone to appear better than they are simply because their career can‚Äôt handle it.  That‚Äôs how people skate.Regarding SNCO retreads, it‚Äôs a tough nut, but perhaps a 7-level top off  in residence course?  Something that combines CTSAC, analytical writing, targeting fundamentals, and intelligence specific NCOPE for TSgts and above as a prerequisite for SEIMC and or 7 or 9-level.  Additionally, make more AOR specialization courses more readily available for NCOs. I cannot tell you how hard it is to find a TDY course for certain AORs: because A there‚Äôs zero funding for it; B they‚Äôre not advertised well; C no one teaches it... I would like to state a specific example here but I‚Äôll be vague and state we don‚Äôt understand SAM‚Äôs for specific counties like we should.This way retreads who may have been forced through the OJT pipeline can get the more advanced job skills they need away from the work that won‚Äôt let them learn it.That and as I mentioned to u/u/412TW_CCC elsewhere on this topic.  Force them to work the line for an entire shift rotation (At least two weeks to two months periodically throughout the year). Meanwhile an alternate TSgt, acting as flight chief, that is being groomed for MSgt, works the admin, gets that experience, while the flight chief just sits mission for a while. Well if you‚Äôre trying to use something to homebrew you could try modifying this...https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/dodecahedron-of-doom I was the lead instructor at Hickam many years ago.  The ONLY trainees I ever had to request training extensions were for three SNCOs and one A1C.  The A1C just wasn‚Äôt cut out for it and we found him a path out of the careerfeild.  The SNCOs?  each of them didn‚Äôt put priority in mission training and ended up putting admin duties as a priority.  Of the 7 SNCOs I‚Äôve trained, it is the ones that told their boss ‚Äúsorry I‚Äôm not trained yet, give me three weeks and I will take over.  But right now I gotta get right by mission.‚Äù that actually completed their training.  Coincidently, it was those ones that told their bosses off that we‚Äôre also were the ones who regularly sat mission so they could fill in for Amn Smuck when he/she had use or lose/death/emergency/sick at a moments notice.I had been at that unit for over six years.  If any of their bosses gave my students crap, I had direct understanding with /permission from the commander that I could tell that LT or Captian off as a SSgt.  But the three SNCOs I mentioned before? well they just wouldn‚Äôt let me deal with it as the instructor.  they didn‚Äôt want to make waves, and (looking back on it with 8 years in between now and then) they weren‚Äôt really good at the job so they probably just thought they could skate by doing admin.  They wouldn‚Äôt show up for training.  Wouldn‚Äôt even let me schedule training sometimes.  They eventually did complete their training (after the commander said ‚Äùno we won‚Äôt get this waived by the general just because your flight can‚Äôt live without you while you do MQT for 2 weeks‚Äù). But! Even then we were forced to never let them sit mission except when required by RIP and even then they couldn‚Äôt do anything beyond the bare minimum requirements.  Often, I think they couldn‚Äôt have even passed an reeval but that wasn‚Äôt my lane as I wasn‚Äôt an IE.That was 8 years ago.  Those guys... I pray... are retired.  The idea of them being SMSgt or even Chiefs gives me pause some days.I get admin is important and it is a extremely difficult balancing act.  BUT if you can‚Äôt do it, maybe you shouldn‚Äôt be an OPSUP, or Flt/chief of a ops flight/training/Stan-eval, or scheduling.  Maybe a UDM or CSS but even then that‚Äôs pushing it because if you don‚Äôt sit mission you can‚Äôt really empathize/sympathize with your people on shift work.A simple solution I‚Äôve seen, is, every other shift rotation, flt chiefs work the line for the entire rotation and are scheduled just like normal airmen.  Meanwhile, an assistant flight chief works the admin.  This let‚Äôs various TSgts get that experience leading flights and gives that SNCO a chance to bond with the front line guys.This solution created a mentality among the Flight chiefs at the unit... ‚Äùeven you aren‚Äôt immune from doing mission.  So know your job/ and don‚Äôt make it harder for people‚Äù That and I think the tests filter out those who cannot use analytics.  It‚Äôs fine, I don‚Äôt think everyone is cut out for leadership, it‚Äôs why contractors are a thing.  If there is a different way to check on an Airman‚Äôs ability to make analytical leadership decision, before putting on the rank, while still making sure objectivity doesn‚Äôt play a factor, I‚Äôm all for it! Down with testing!  (I spent months on studying and never scored above an 76)But in lack of something better, I‚Äôm not okay with not using something to vet this ability. I don‚Äôt think boards do a good job at that.This is mainly because relying on what boils down to the writing ability of supervision isn‚Äôt an objective method of venting someone‚Äôs analytical capabilities.  Especially, when the current environment wants ‚Äúinnovated, spearheaded, created‚Äù in EVERYONE‚ÄôS EPR or you won‚Äôt even be looked at.  This creates a watering down of the impact of these words and doesn‚Äôt reflect how well that person gains consensus and weighs options when standing up the program/leading their team.‚ÄúAction; impact - - result‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt capture the how well as easily without extremely nuanced and deliberate wording. Aren‚Äôt they changing that below the zone stuff? > Call mids in, in the middle of their sleep cycle, because the GP/CC says the commanders call is mandatory for all hands? Sure, np.This caused serious flashbacks to complete batshit shenanigans of working RPA ops.Yes let‚Äôs make it so EVERYOnE else has to stay past their shift for training instead of just having one person train each shift separately. God... man Fabian last season was the man!Glances at Fabian this season...(What the hell is wrong with his rolls?) Lot of retread 1Ns also compound this problem.  Nothing against retreads but when they disregard the career 1N‚Äôs advice/assessment out of habit because ‚Äúthey know better than the SSgt because SNCO‚Äù its a big fucking issue. ^^^  This...but 14 years. There are pros and cons. Problem is, when you have four or less subordinates (many of us do), it‚Äôs really difficult to be anonymous. Additionally, a SrA promoting to staff may very well not have any subordinates to rate on their leadership capability. There is definitely merit in that system of feedback, but far from a total solution and an added time suck. Sorry, on phone, in car, potato fingers, etc...autocorrect hates me. And yet we‚Äôre thinking of doing away with promotion testing so we can be just like them.... Ac-130 gunship...Helicopters....

Government roads, in this case, act as an enabler/drug, preventing a need for true innovation.  The problem is already solved, so there‚Äôs far less motivation to try to solve it again. Wait.... Capitalism Hasn't existed since money was first invented? Well a delivery company would probably have a vested interest in keeping and maintaining a method of delivery.  However if we could just jump to a flying transportation that is safe/affordable and easy to learn/fly; and the only thing people would have to remember is if you‚Äôre flying a certain cardinal direction, you fly at a specific altitude, we wouldn‚Äôt need roads.  But no! We gotta have flight safety regulations, airspace restrictions and training that is equivalent to an associates degree in training hours just to pilot extremely expensive/non consumer friendly aircraft that rely on monopolistic airports JUST to function.

I forgot all about Ross Several months back or maybe a year back Phil made an off hand comment about someone he thought was a friend using him to to only gain a better position in life.  He then went on to say he cut ties with that person and didn‚Äôt need someone like that in his life.  Wonder if this is that person or if it‚Äôs a different person.When he made the comment, I got the impression it was someone from the old sourcefed cast but couldn‚Äôt figure out who.  (Not that it‚Äôs honestly any of my business, folks be folks)I would have bet steve as I hadn‚Äôt seen Phil mention steve in a long time (but that‚Äôs just personal bias).

Well the ones not caged or trapped in rooms. Way I did mine is print it as a pdf as 4 pages per sheet, cut off the excess paper, then systematically cover with scotch tape.

Wizards are dead but I doubt anyone could ever kill every fucking lich, it would take a 10th level spell.  And those are basically impossible to do.  And where there are wizards (or were in this case) there is always at least one lich.  Lichs can be bargained with for souls, new spells that increase their power, sometimes you‚Äôll find one that is just bored and looking to stir shit up but that‚Äôs going a little against cannon lore.One things for sure, if you do use a lich, he ain‚Äôt vegita on a redemption arch.  It will kill your party just for funzies and laugh while doing it.  They are a devil you don‚Äôt know to fight the demon you do.  But something I rarely see is female lichs, could be fun twist.  That or maybe (and this is a huge leap...) a gold or silver dragon?  The silver dragon being the more likely as they tend to live amoung humans more.  That said gold dragons are cannon wizards as well as sorcerers.That or a dracolich... say you find some of its remains and feed it to a t-Rex.

It always devolves into either a oligarchy or tyrannical dictatorships... because humans suck.... always It also can translate to ‚Äúgrant us eternal rest‚Äù...or Figuratively ‚Äúdear merciful god please just let us/them die‚ÄùIt apparently originates from [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dies_irae) known as the mass for the dead. Because the Air Force is not the Army.  I know you probably are actually curious and I‚Äôm extremely sorry about this tangent I‚Äôm about to go on but I‚Äôm still sore from my joint army assignment two years ago and it so you‚Äôre gonna get a little venting.... again I‚Äôm sorry.See we have a mission and think about the best way to do it and then do it.  The rest (So called ‚Äúobligations‚Äù) is flavoring and excess in our eyes.  Sure it‚Äôs fun to be military sometimes but the Air Force is a corporation as much as it is a military branch.  We don‚Äôt need/want the extra shit because we spent it on morale and time with family.  We accept (for the most part) that airmen are adults and expect them to behave as such.  (There are exceptions ... maintenance I‚Äôm looking at you)We (Most airmen/NCO and most but not all SNCO) also do not believe in the leadership concept exposed by many in the army (looking at you specifically Fort Hood assholes that belong to third corps)  that ‚Äúshared suck builds morale‚Äú.  There are officer that believe this but they typically are kept away from the troops as much as possible.  We instead would simply ask why it sucks, figure out how to improve it and then not ask anyone to ‚Äúsleep in the dirt‚Äù  when literally no one fucking has to.  This is why you hear ‚Äúinnovation is the key to AirPower.‚Äù  That innovation can be it‚Äôs own ass pain but that‚Äôs a complaint for another time.  (It ain‚Äôt all unicorn and golf courses sadly) The army, on the other hand, will see that the situation sucks and then asks, how can we make this equally suck for everyone?  the. Give absolutely no fucks on how to actually improve the situation because Why would they?the Air Force‚Äôs obligations are to the mission, and the mission is to keep the jets in the air, kill shit and break things.  Beyond that, well... we‚Äôre adults.  If you can‚Äôt be an adult, usually after the second article 15, you‚Äôre gone within two months.  Hell it might not even take that long.  Sometimes after the third LOR they‚Äôre looking at ways to separate ya.  most airmen go their whole career and don‚Äôt see a single article 15.The army gives that shit out like candy, and then lets that idiot promote to SSG or higher so they can continue to inflict their idiocy on others, we don‚Äôt tolerate fuck ups long enough.  And if they do somehow make it to SNCO we generally figure out ways to mitigate them to relatively unimportant posts.  (The assholes still get through but they generally aren‚Äôt as bad as we make them out to be on this sub)Most of us are older, and genuinely only care about making it through the day without fucking up so bad that a plane crashes and a bomb didn‚Äôt land where and when it shouldn‚Äôt.  Next to that... we let the little shit fly...This understanding could be the source of why our suicide rate is the lowest in the military but it might be completely off base.TLDR: We don‚Äôt have time to deal with the ‚Äúobligations‚Äù because we‚Äôre too busy doing the jobs of 8 people and kicking out or not letting in anyone that can‚Äôt cut it.

In theory, it should force them to stay on message about the candidate‚Äôs own policies and not just saying ‚Äúwell... I‚Äôm not my opponent‚ÄùBut (and this is me just trying to refine your idea so it‚Äôs loophole proof) what would stop the negative ad from simply saying ‚Äúthat other candidate‚Äù instead of saying the candidate‚Äôs actual name.  Legally, the dishonest candidate could just say, ‚Äúwell... I was talking about THEM specifically, just a fictitious/hypothetical candidate on which I could compare myself too‚Äù.  I see lawyers having a field day with that.  Still if you can figure out how to word it where something like that couldn‚Äôt happen... it might be worth it.Regarding your first point, it was Facebook employees that want to do this... you know... the ones that would be doing the filtering... oh course THEY want to, they apparently feel it‚Äôs their moral and ethical obligation to ~~control~~ ensure the voting public ... is properly informed!I say this mostly in jest but there is some truth to it.The 2016 election was extremely difficult to parse out truth from the ‚Äúmy truth,‚Äù ‚Äútruthiness,‚Äù ‚Äúdisinformation‚Äù and ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù  People would often conflate opinions as facts without even realizing those were opinions.  It‚Äôs why poltifacts and fact checkers sprung up like weeds that year.  In this chaos, politicians like Hillary and Trump thrived.  Policy wonks like Kasich, Cruz and Paul didn‚Äôt have a chance against Trump and none of Hilary‚Äôs candidate-opponents did either.  It basically devolved into who had the best online social media presence.  So I can‚Äôt fault the Facebook staff for feeling like they need to do something.  (After all they likely genuinely feel responsible for it)But like you have already stated, do we really want to trust them?  After all! We don‚Äôt know them! We don‚Äôt know if their opinions are like ours!  We don‚Äôt know if they would secretly try to surpass controversial or conflicting ideas that THEY personally didn‚Äôt agree with but we‚Äôre still valid and truthful.  How would I know if what I see is the news, or simply a version that was filtered from me?  Carefully curated so that my opinions would only be formed by the information feed I can see.We‚Äôre busy people, we can‚Äôt be expected to be able to break out of bubble every single day!  That why we set up news feed, and browse Reddit, listen to Phil, and other YouTube news guys.  Because these people we at least somewhat know.  We know what their opinions are! We can see their post history!  We can judge if THEY are ‚Äúokay/worthy‚Äù through our interactions with them, and their history.  But these Facebook moderators?   Nope not so much.  We can choose them with a upvote or downvote, they choose themselves.  And that seems wrong.I don‚Äôt know if I have a great point with all this.  But maybe someone can read this little rant and get on idea on how to fix the situation where it seems like we can actually trust what we read, hear, say and see.  I know one thing: I am tired of bullshit > Targeted and non public misinformationThat is a genie I wish we could put back in the bottle Honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea to allow any social media to fact check politicians or anyone without some kind of stop gap to allow both sides to present their sides.  Beyond that, that‚Äôs the company‚Äôs policy, don‚Äôt give them your money, or do, that‚Äôs free market.That said, as long as it fair to both sides, I actually think political adds should automatically be rebutted by their opponents.  The election black outs does sound interesting though, because it would allow at least two years breathier between presidential election cycles.

Yeah it‚Äôs like we learned nothing from 2010.... So Baghdadi is dead...  woo Does that mean ISIS is defeated enough to actually leave?I don‚Äôt think so We don‚Äôt. You get to choose between two characters, an oath of ancients teifling paladin that gave up being a warlock/sorcerer because he would miss his brother too much.  A truly tragic backstory where every Woman that has ever loved him has died, painfully and tragically.Or the paladins edgy/salty, extremely charismatic, Fighter class, older brother, whose true calling is a Cleric but denies that side of himself because he likes killing Monsters too much.  Their celestial boss has the hots for him but the fighter is all about the ladies.  Even courted Shar, the goddess of darkness, at one point.  Rarely if ever the fighter, maintains a longer term relationship.  Mainly because he‚Äôs seen what a whiny bitch it‚Äôs made his brother.  There was one but the boss has to remove all memories of him for their own protection.Both have an on again off again ‚Äúfreinemy‚Äù Demon that has a tendency to convince you he‚Äôs somehow changed for the better but he‚Äôs still a bastard. Da faq?How separated from society‚Äôs day to day do you have to be to think people can just buy a new phone. Well it all depends on what happened to the child after you kidnapped them.... if you sold them to the fey... well I‚Äôve got some news for ya. In a campaign before my current one, the DM has us go on this quest to kill a baby dragon.  We get back the whole town is ash except for a sole surviving 11 year old girl.  She is found in the ashes of what used to be her parents.  We escort this child, feeding her, taking care of her, protecting her, on a two day journey to her last surviving relative, her uncle.  Turns out she wasn‚Äôt supposed to survive and was a witness the bad guys didn‚Äôt want left.  They tie us up and the BBEG slits her throat in front of us.  Well that pretty much sent the whole party into rage... and not just in the game too. Big difference in maturity between those ages though. Somehow I think there is more to the story than you standing up for a character‚Äôs mother‚Äôs chastity Truly a great meme.  You would think DND players wouldn‚Äôt mind reading Wasn‚Äôt he a dept sherif at one point and even served warrants or something?Edit found it:  https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2006/10/25/deputy-shaq-part-of-botched-va-raid/But more recently he‚Äôs become fairly active in law enforcement across the countryhttps://www.lawenforcementtoday.com/shaq-sworn-deputy/ Leave the upvotes, I handle this myself So you‚Äôre saying all a bard has to do to get a dragon‚Äôs attention is gather some wealth?#CHALLENGE ACCEPTED You get your taskings from a celestial with a permeant five O‚Äôclock shadow, a deep voice and even deeper blue eyes.  He wears something akin to a grey toned petticoat.He walks into the room, greeting you warmly but awkwardly, like he‚Äôs not used to mortal formalities like ... eye contact or hand gestures.  There is a fait sadness in his face...(Go ahead and roll a perception check... you‚Äôve been working for this guy for a minute so I‚Äôm gonna go ahead and say roll with advantage)  ‚ÄúThat is how you do it?‚ÄùThe joke kinda fell flat I guess.It‚Äôs literally the song that played in my head when I read the head line.It‚Äôs excellent that the coach was able to talk him out of that state of mind.  It takes a lot of courage and ability to empathize with someone to be in that spot and hug it out.  I‚Äôve managed (somehow by the grace of God) to talk three people out of Suicide in my life time but never when there was a gun in their hand, ready to pull the trigger.  It‚Äôs worthy of great praise. [That](http://i.imgur.com/Md5tRgd.jpg) NaTuRe Is OpPreSsIvE No lie I‚Äôve encountered that argument before and it made me openly question whether civilization is all that great. Nope, if I‚Äôm an old man I hope I can be half a good at being a wise old man as he is.  That said, I may want to be like him but if I can avoid the extremely tragic backstory my sons and wife would appreciate it.‚ÄúLittle solider boy, come marching home‚Äù is not something I think I can sing very well. Is it possible you could post things from less partisan perspectives?Please see our announcement stickied to the top of the sub regarding bias and partisanship.You‚Äôll likely get less downvotes and will get more interaction.Also, this isn‚Äôt a campaign sub. So you‚Äôll likely get better interaction if you don‚Äôt focus on a single candidate or party. Hey why do you keep glancing off camera, in fear for your life? In the behind the senses commentary, the actor in this meme actually had to endure allergic reactions to the makeup.  He stated he had to use ‚Äúbreathing techniques‚Äù he picked up from karate to make it through sessions.  I often wonder if this was improvised from that situation. The flavored issue seems bad to me.  Here‚Äôs why, I think it will push people to buy more non-quality products as they seek better flavors. This sounds like a reason to move away from California and find a state that can certify you quickly. Phil will often share videos in his ‚Äútoday in awesome segment‚Äù he‚Äôll also feature videos in his ‚Äúsecret link of the day‚Äù.  My guess is it is related to that. Something i realized on a rewatch nearly every person he uses a hexblade curse on is never killed.  In fact, in most cases they end up surviving situations they shouldn‚Äôt have. I would love nothing more than to use this on a wild magic roll.  These are awesome. This is basically the plot of escape the bloodkeep Yes Definitely saw this with #AF and above positions.  They got those guys out quick. This is what happens when the DIME principal is ignored. The NSFW community of Reddit can be pretty open and welcoming... but there is a side that is extremely toxic and sees the individual on the screen as more of an object than a person, and will fiercely protect their community when threatened.  Additionally porn is in a huge demand.  It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if this disassociation is related to simply ensuring the ‚Äú~~spice~~.. porn must flow‚Äù Due to Reddit‚Äôs new harassment policy I have to clarify with the admins to see if I can approve this as it links to SO many of social media accounts.  It‚Äôs definitely a story I think phil would be interested in but Im also not looking to get the sub quarantined.  Please stand by, the admins take a while to respond. Why do this?  Also that intro makes no sense.  Also... also I threw up. Ah only on the first of the second series. When?  Is that in the second series?

Truly God‚Äôs work Already some on here saying that > As always, we will defend the pride and dignity of China at all cost."Well that about sums it up This was basically what happened on dimension20‚Äôs unsleeping city this week. Huh... didn‚Äôt they outlaw guns recently? The emperor invites you to lake lalogahiThere is no avatar the last air bender movie The emperor invites you to LakeLaogai That‚Äôs the one with the blue aliens right?As far as I know Avatar has always just been a show. This is giving me flashbacks to unsleeping city‚Äôs most recent episode.Fuck legendary resistance I‚Äôve found the [‚Äúadventuring academy‚Äù videos extremely helpful and reassuring](https://youtu.be/pURrup121Xk) Well without a tank... what else can they do? This looks like something we could potentially see on unsleeping city.  Come to think of it they haven‚Äôt fought mimics on Deminsion20 so this could be really cool.Also instead of it being a single mimic I‚Äôm picturing this as a swarm of mimics chasing you down the hall.  Ya did good Haven‚Äôt even watched it yet but this should be juicy. That has yet to be seen, we only got half way into the encounter before we had to pause You know how you can stare at a word and you know it‚Äôs not right but for the life of you you don‚Äôt know why?Thanks for this! FixedNow if we can just get the boss to ‚Äúfix‚Äù the pay scale. Brand new Druid and she just lost her companion Another possibility is worgs. Some are sentient enough to speak common. I ran into this my last session.  We‚Äôre supposed to go fight these werewolves in the center of a forest.  Two members (a Druid and a rogue) of my party get this bright idea.... well if we burn down the forest it will kill the werewolves.  I try to convince them that it‚Äôs a bad idea but they won‚Äôt listen.  I cast speak with animals and in the middle of me talking to a fox, ‚Äúit mentions that the paths in this forest are tricky, you‚Äôll be walking one direction, and end up in a completely different area and direction the next (implying the forest is enchanted and protected).As this fox is explaining this to me, it is at this point the pyromaniacs decide it‚Äôs the best time to put into action their plan.  But to do so they try and climb the tree first.  The Druid fails to climb instantly, the rogue succeeds.My character (an oath of ancients paladin) yells up to the guy ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm not sure this is a good idea, the fox is saying the forest is protected or something.‚ÄùThe murderhobo says, I think he‚Äôs too far up in the tree to hear you.  I (glance at the DM who has an evil grin on his face).  I smirk and direct my character to keep walking.  The rogue manages to set fire to the tree limb he‚Äôs standing on only to have the limb move from the wind and he falls and takes 4 points of damage.  The limb instantly puts itself out.  So he climbs the tree again.  I keep walking, and yell back again ‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good idea, I think this forest is enchanted‚ÄùHe says that he can‚Äôt hear me.  This time a limb smacks him in the face and he takes another 2 points of damage.  My character (and the rest of the party) just keeps moving as a series of limbs bat this guy around like a pinball and he lands in front of us with a thud with half his hit points left.‚ÄúAh there you are!  Were you able to find any dry wood?  No? Probably best you don‚Äôt set fire to this forest anyway.  That celestial that put us on this quest is probably the one that is responsible for this place.  And if he didn‚Äôt get pissed off for burning it down, there‚Äôs probably some metal dragon that we can‚Äôt see deep in an area we needn‚Äôt go to, that would love nothing more than to roast us for burning its home to the ground.‚ÄùWe step over him and continue our journey.  Sometimes they just have to learn there‚Äôs consequences for burning everything down. Actually they have everything to gain by invading it.  If Kurdistan became a real place it would take up a third of Turkey, a quarter of Syria, a 1/6 of Iraq and the northwest corner of Iran.  The way the region sees it, Turkey is doing each of those nations a favor by reducing that threat to their sovereignty.Meanwhile the Turks get to continue to suppress the Kurds and the chaotic violence continues.While the Kurds were backed by the US, Turkey wouldn‚Äôt dare go full out war with them.  Now that the US is leaving, it‚Äôs just more middle eastern killing themselves, ‚Äúso who the hell cares?‚Äù/s. Well... the fact is, it‚Äôs that kind of environment that breeds extremism.  And while I‚Äôm extremely tired of the Middle East and their inability to understand everyone is equal, I‚Äôd also like to prevent global terrorist networks from having places to establish themselves, because otherwise we get planes in buildings, and bombs on trains, as these bastards try to ‚Äúmake a name for themselves‚Äù.Hell! I‚Äôd say leave tomorrow if they would all just leave ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù aka the great satan out of their rhetoric.  But as long as the ‚Äúdeath to America‚Äù is a rallying cry for idiots with a death wish, it‚Äôs never going to happen. Well let‚Äôs look at our regional allies... we‚Äôve got Iraq.. they barely hold it together, Saudi Arabia... they‚Äôre not the best allies...  and Afghanistan... again... not so much.... that leaves Israel.... well...not the best partners to have in the region.We could have had Iran but that would require a time machine that goes back to the 1960s and preventing the rise of the grand ayatollah.That leaves TurkeyEdit: also the Kuwaitis (who have a lot of influence economically speaking but  don‚Äôt have much military or diplomatic influence) To be honest it‚Äôs not that the US is digging its self out it‚Äôs just simply offering stability until the Iraqi and Syrian governments are able to handle it.  The only successful models of counter insurgency I‚Äôm aware usually take a generation of consist presence.  This constant withdraw and reapplying of pressure doesn‚Äôt help things.  > Consistency and a stable infrastructure is key to a happy populace. >  Happy populace equals resistance to insurgency with out fascism.  > Resistance to insurgency without fascism means we leave we don‚Äôt have to come back because their inability to keep extremists no longer threatens world stability.Half of those things are possible.  But I do know this, the chance for us to withdrawal ended the day we left. Apologies I thought I was replying to you but ended up making a separate response.  [The response is here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeFranco/comments/deqqrl/wow_guess_who_is_being_paid_to_repair_saudi/f2ypm5k/) Really?  Crap I must have done something wrong then in my assessment... Yeah the Middle East is a quagmire of fucked up but when you‚Äôve had to deal with it for as long as I have it begins to make a weird sense.  It‚Äôs still unpredictable as shit but you eventually learn what doesn‚Äôt work.  And ignoring intel is never a good idea How much time you got?ISIS formed from a number of reasons most importantly from the fact that when the US invaded Iraq, it removed all bathist from power.  (Which to even work in the Iraqi government at the time was required).  So even the lowly mail clerk, or any police officer who basically was bathist because... ‚Äúhey... a guy‚Äôs got to eat‚Äù ended up getting shitcanned at best or sent to abu grave for a few months at worse.This left a power vacuum.  The US, not fully understanding the situation, allowed ‚Äúanyone not bathist‚Äù to be part of the government... didn‚Äôt matter if the had a criminal background or not.  This led to a bunch of disenfranchised Bathist who knew how to run a government but had no job and saw the US as the reason.  Desperate, they turn to AQI (Alqeda in Iraq) because ‚Äúfuck Americans‚Äù that‚Äôs why.  As AQI gains power, a faction within called Islamic State (IS), which is more interested in running things like a criminal enterprise instead of a insurgency, pops up.These new guys, start making counterfeit documents (birth certificates, drivers licenses, passports, etc) better than the Iraqi government can.  They also are extremely organized and start laying roots in Mosul.  It‚Äôs now 2009 and the war against AQI has reach a point we‚Äôre violence is finally on the decline.  Emboldened by this, and under intense political pressure, President Obama begins a troop withdrawal around 2010, counter to expert opinions saying that the reduction in violence isn‚Äôt stable yet because there is still a potential that, in our absence, the Iraqi government is still not equipped to handle a full blown insurgency.We withdraw anyway, and the ‚ÄúArab Spring‚Äù happens.  This eventually triggers a civil war in Syria.  Meanwhile, in Iraq, the Sunni and Shia do what they do best... isolate, belittle and kill each other.  IS sees an opportunity and leaves for Syria to gain influence and power amidst the chaos, becoming what the US forces at the time referred  to as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (aka the Da‚Äôesh).  Sunni-Shia relations continue to break down in Iraq and ISIS again sees an opportunity.  Now that the US has completely withdrawn from Iraq they formally take over Mosul.  Their territory quickly expands and by 2014 they are all but at Baghdad‚Äôs door.These guy‚Äôs logistics are not like AQI terrorist cells.  These guys are meticulous and well organized.  (You remember the bathist I was talking about? Well who do you think is now running ISIS book keeping?)Many areas weary of the Sunni-Shia violence eagerly accept ISIS‚Äôs control because with fascism comes stability at the cost of freedom.  Plus ISIS is better at running governments than the current Iraqi government at the time.  Then people realize what they‚Äôve done... then comes the food and water shortages. 2014, after intense pressure, President Obama again returns to Iraq... this time to defeat the worst political ideology we‚Äôve known since the Nazis (ironic because ISIS were also national socialist).  Which leads us today, with the help of the US backed Kurds and coalition of extremely unlikely allies we‚Äôve manage to all but defeat ISIS.  They no longer ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù territory but they are still there, biding their time, waiting to take over the area again through various criminal and quasi-legitimate enterprises, as soon as the world isn‚Äôt paying attention.For more reading I recommend the following:https://www.nato.int/docu/review/2018/Also-in-2018/can-isis-regroup-lessons-from-interviews-with-ex-isis-fighters-syria/EN/index.htmlhttps://www.axios.com/defeat-of-isis-battle-of-mosul-iraq-james-verini-c5373dc2-5d85-43b2-aa93-03fba45b154e.html We tried it before and that‚Äôs how we got ISIS.  There is a way to withdrawal but it ain‚Äôt ignoring the facts that are presented My guess is the withdrawal is a combination of President Trump wanting to say he‚Äôs finished the US actions in Iraq and Syria (much like Former President Obama did near the end of his first term) and a redistribution of force‚Äôs towards Iran and Afghanistan.Iran...well the writings on the walls [trump still blames Iran for recent drone attacks](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/14/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-refineries-drone-attack.amp.html).

That means they weren‚Äôt even born before 9-11.  They likely don‚Äôt even understand why we‚Äôre even fighting the Taliban in the first place.For what it‚Äôs worth, I think we‚Äôre very quickly headed to the exact same situation we had in 2012 and will be right back in Iraq and quite possibly Syria in two to four years. I doubt Turkey will ‚Äúsuper promise not‚Äù to release ISIS detainees on the remaining Kurds (who were extremely instrumental to defeating ISIS in the first place.)I hate the idea of even being in the Middle East, but if we leave, we need to ensure we won‚Äôt have to be back again, 3, 5 or 10 years later.

Instead of a text post that only contains a link.  Can you simply submit a link post.  This helps prevent people from posting the same link twice. This happened last night. We just had to switch DMs.  Being a nice DM, the ‚Äúnew DM‚Äù, allowed us to keep our previous characters (all no higher than level 4) from the previous campaign under a few restrictions.  Namely, we all get sucked into a portal wake up in a jail cell with all our equipment outside the jail cell.Now, what we were supposed to do is simply wait and (who I think is) the BBEG (or one of his henchmen) was supposed to go through the prison and kill most of the guards, leaving us one or two guards to mop up without our gear.  Well the prison bars were rusty and old. With some luck we managed to get the bars ripped off and broke the benches in our cells into clubs and shanks.  Shenanigans ensue and we find ourselves facing off against 6 armed prison guards and an archer. With nothing but wooden clubs and shanks...  thunder wave plus ensnaring strike in a narrow hallway equals a bunch of guards in prone positions while we systematically gang up on each one and take out, or subdue all of them.  As we exited the cell block we discovered that the rest of the guards were straight up pinned to the wall game of thrones style with a note pinned to the wall saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre welcome meet me in the tavern.‚ÄùTLDR: Turns out if we had just waited in our cells for five minutes, we would have only had to fight two guards and leave and it spend 3 hours fighting the guards.  I did manage to befriend two of them, sadly we asked them to go ahead of us and went around a corner only to have a knife land in their neck as they checked to see if the path was clear.DM said, we‚Äôll i should have put a stop to it but it was so damn entertaining he just let it happen. > petition to start a sub just for characters.This could be useful and fun but I would be completely out of my depth running a sub like that, so if any good DnD mods have some time... r/DND_backstory is available.

ADL... how are they are considered reputable in such discussions is beyond me I miss after the trump. [Nah](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeFranco/comments/d9cw38/brought_to_you_by/)For some reason people don‚Äôt comment on these posts very often. The US has survived impeachments in the past.  IMO, they‚Äôve had enough to do an emplacement for a min, however the timing of this was simply to sour his chances at a re-election bid.  They‚Äôll drag this out for as long as they can.  Whether they find something or not, the damage to President Trump will be done.Now how that translates to damage to the US all depends on how it effects the economy.  Diplomatically, it ‚Äúmight‚Äù actually help because it shows no President is above the law (even if found innocent).  Economically it will likely have impacts, and leave the market in doubt, but again, the US will recover.  It always does, just a matter of time scale. ‚ÄúHuston, we have a problem‚Äù\- Austin, Tx Wait... you don‚Äôt? Regarding the climate statement.  I really wish Kasich had made it further than he did.  Imagine a Republican Party that understands climate change is a real thing, and feels we should at least do something.  But while thinking about what could have been, can help us see paths to improve the situation, you must also think about what you can do today.* Increasing nuclear power plant production* providing subsidies/tax cuts for renewables equivalent to what we pay to fossil fuels* encouragement of more EV charging stations across the countryThese are within the realms that the Republican Party could back.  But this demonizing of a girl whose words ‚Äúmake you feel bad‚Äù is shameful. > those that aren‚Äôt, are capable of misinterpreting anything in the way they want to.I can‚Äôt agree with this sentiment more.

I usually use internet today to get me through the days Phil isn‚Äôt posting.  Phil stated a month(ish?) ago that he‚Äôd only be doing the occasional Friday show to give his crew a break. Hello gran gata how may I serve? Definitely annoyed by it.  The whole two parties determining the fate of the country hasn‚Äôt really settled well with me for a while now.

(But again treat every thing I‚Äôm about to explain with a massive helping of salt and tin foil hats)> Apparently, [when the gold standard was removed, we needed some kind of way to ensure security of US currency.  Nixon in his ehemm... ‚Äúways‚Äù worked out a deal with Saudi Arabia, that if the Saudi‚Äôs exclusively sell their oil with US dollars then the US would agree to protect them under any circumstances](https://citizentruth.org/the-secret-deal-that-formed-the-us-and-saudi-arabias-special-relationship/amp/).  This ensures money that is basically backed by nothing but ‚Äúour word/debt‚Äù is still valuable. Now the Saudi‚Äôs using US dollars for oil deals is a real thing... [well was a real thing](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-usa-oil-exclusive-idUSKCN1RH008)And the Economist Paul Samuelson and others (including, at his death, Milton Friedman) have maintained that the overseas demand for dollars allows the United States to maintain persistent trade deficits without causing the value of the currency to depreciate or the flow of trade to readjust. But Samuelson stated in 2005 that at some uncertain future period these pressures would precipitate a run against the U.S. dollar with serious global financial consequences. And [in 1974 there was an economic and military defense agree made](https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/09/archives/milestone-pact-is-signed-by-us-and-saudi-arabia-acclaimed-by.html)So maybe it‚Äôs true...If that‚Äôs the case, that would mean the US dollar is built on the success of Saudi Arabia, and its oil.  That would make it seem that renewables are a threat to the dollar.  But in today‚Äôs economy where nearly every country ‚Äúfloats‚Äù their currency, I don‚Äôt think it would be a significant impact today.  Back then when not having a gold backed currency was risky, sure! But today not as much of an issue. All that said, that certainly could be a motivation to prioritize oil over renewables...  but at the end of the day I guess that‚Äôs still greed. This is one of those things I really feel Republicans took the wrong approach on.  What if we subsidized non fossil fuel energy production to the same level as we subsidize fossil fuel production?  Or at the very least provided substantial tax cuts for solar panels and wind turbines that were primarily fabricated within the United StatesWhat if we prioritized Nuclear plant production until renewables  are able to replace them fully, by slightly reducing some of the hurdles needed to even build a plant?  These are all pro capitalist solutions, and its never talked about among my fellow Republicans.  (Well it is amount moderates... but that‚Äôs not the case elsewhere in the spectrum) > If your personal opinions are rooted in that intolerance, then bringing you into the fold would just support intolerant ideas.In my opinion, those staunchly stuck on the right currently aren't real conservatives, and there isn't really any political debate of any substance that could be had. As one of the worst offenders of this once said, projecting as hard as he possibly could, "facts don't care about your feelings".This right here is why conservatives won‚Äôt debate you, because you‚Äôve already judged conservatives as racist.  This is an ad hominem and a frankly biased as hell stance when debating conservatives.  Specifically this is a variant of the no true Scotsmen‚Äôs fallacy...That all conservatives must be intolerant.  And because they must be intolerant, then they don‚Äôt deserve a voice, as ‚Äúthey couldn‚Äôt possibly add anything of substance‚ÄùThat‚Äôs frankly bullshit.> I find this sentence really amusing, and lacking any form of self-awareness. The current right supports more forms of hostility than the current left could ever match. Family separation, school shootings, vehicular manslaughter, all of these things have been tied to right-leaning views time and time again. Vehicular manslaughter?  That‚Äôs a new one.This is the kinda stuff we‚Äôre talking about.  If a right leaning person makes even the slightest complaint it turns into let‚Äôs drudge up every bad thing the right has done and ignore if that person is even sympathetic to that shit.  I wouldn‚Äôt hold a Democrat or left leaning person responsible for the fucked up shit communist have done, why would you hold a Republican or right leaning centrist for the fucked up shit racist Neo-Nazis have done?> Complaining to the mod mommyI‚Äôll be clear.  We want to have open and fair discussions here.  We ban leftists and conservatives alike and in equal numbers.  Respect the rules here, treat all users here with respect regardless of ‚Äúwhether you think they deserve to have their voice heard or not‚Äù, or get the hell off this sub, period. Something to keep in mind, she had a boss and sometimes, you have to sell things your boss wants like you believe it.  She‚Äôd likely rarely say anything bad about W, even today.  Why?

Exceptionally nice lady, (super tall) and very very smart.I‚Äôd certainly like to have seen her more active in politics.  It would have given President Trump a run for the money.  Perhaps 2024?

[Meanwhile we‚Äôve got China doing their thing unchecked](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/peoples-republic-of-the-united-nations) because we have folks that don‚Äôt understand the value of the DIME concept. It‚Äôs mostly a joke.  But part of me really wishes we lived in a word where we literally didn‚Äôt have to track race whatsoever.  (I know we have to because keeping track of demographics is how we ensure fairness throughout communities). I just wish we could get past it all.  Where no one cares what your skin tone is just where you come from (your past experience that make up you).  I don‚Äôt know if that makes sense or not.  (It‚Äôs definitely naive, but it‚Äôs something to hope for) I‚Äôll be honest, I didn‚Äôt even know they were on there.  This is awesome though. Very happy for the winner. We have the avoid ad hominem rule for this exact reason.  If anyone is mocking you for expressing a genuine opinion please report it.  (We can‚Äôt read every single comment)That said, this is one of the reasons we posted the bias post a few months back.  The only thing I can suggest is taking a more active role.  Yes you‚Äôll get down voted, but there are several here who have right leaning and centrist opinions who likely would love to say something but feel they can‚Äôt for one reason or another. I‚Äôve definitely felt like I can‚Äôt comment my actual opinions here for fear of drawing out the worst of trolls here in the past.  Hell! I‚Äôve even picked up bots that would artificially keep my comments or posts at exactly 0 until at least 6 people upvotes it! (That was fun to report to the admins) But I realized, that‚Äôs letting them control the conversation.  I greatly encourage you to comment more.  If anyone is insulting or ad homineming you, please report them, and the mods here will try to address it.All that said, Reddit does lean heavily left.  During election seasons it gets even worse.  Conservatives, Republicans and centrist end up retreating to their perspective subs because having a conversation during this time period is near impossible.  This only further magnifies the perspective sides issues with each other, [because thought germs are a thing.](https://youtu.be/rE3j_RHkqJc).  This is why I encourage you to post, because everyone‚Äôs beliefs and opinions need to be challenged...Yours, mine, and there‚Äôs!  And the only way others will feel welcomed is if there are like minded folks expressing their opinions.  (Is it messy?  Oh yeah! But that‚Äôs what having a conversation is all about)I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve gotten treated this way, hopefully it gets better.  Phil has always used his hands extremely expressively while talking.  It was a meme at a certain point. My favorite title for this so far> The FBI reportedly did not investigate a previously unknown allegation against Brett KavanaughThe title indicates that the FBI wasn‚Äôt aware of it either, which is really redundant, and makes you think ‚Äúwell yeah... of course they didn‚Äôt investigate it... they didn‚Äôt know about it, why is that news?‚Äù Honestly...

Biologically speaking your brain doesn‚Äôt [hit maturity until 25](https://mentalhealthdaily.com/2015/02/18/at-what-age-is-the-brain-fully-developed/) so is it any surprise that we get idiocy like this in college?

[Tax Incentivized wage thresholds](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/8gooqg/everyone_how_would_you_eliminate_the_wealth/dydiklx/).  The key point here though is choice.That said, there is definitely a great argument to be made  for safety nets.  Answers with Joe did a great video on it.  It never convinced me that UBI could ever work but it did convince me that [safety nets help.](https://youtu.be/c4W8p3b2p58?t=13m38s) I‚Äôm completely out of the loop who are you talking about?

Funamation has put them on YouTube for free Yes yes it is As someone who is (finally!) recovering from surgery after four years of misdiagnosis and PT waivers and will have to test for the first time and has only been given about two months to really train up for it, I can‚Äôt agree with this sentiment enough.  I am busting my ass (running four days a week: two distance and two sprints, and weights at least one day a week) but three years of not being able to run in any meaningful distance, means I have a mountain to go up. I‚Äôm still 1 min too slow and my test is next month.  (Which is a great improvement considering last month I was 2.5 minutes too slow.)  Had I just one more month than I have, I could be back in standard.Until I started getting compartment syndrome, my test was always above a 90.  The timing of this first real test couldn‚Äôt be worse, for if I fail, there won‚Äôt be a chance to retest before the EPR closes out. The Air Force‚Äôs answer?  ‚ÄúThe wavier is not meant to get you out of a PT test‚Äù.  (Which is absolutely true!

You might be interested in the causal historian youtube channel.  He‚Äôs got some great insight into stuff that you may find helpful. Not sure if you‚Äôve been watching ‚Äúthe unsleeping city‚Äù on dropout, but they talk about this very concept as it relates to dreams. In the latest episode.  (It‚Äôs not on youtube yet otherwise I‚Äôd post it here.)If you aren‚Äôt caught up on the show then I‚Äôm about to get into some spoiler territory.You‚Äôve been warned... three... two.. one...Dreams have this great way of being in a quantum state, and therefore able to be a lot of things to a lot of people all at once.  When something becomes ‚Äúreal‚Äù or ‚Äútangible‚Äù or ‚Äúfixed‚Äù that‚Äôs when all the other possibilities for that dream die.A great example they use in the show is the American Dream.  It means a lot to a lot of people, and there‚Äôs nearly infinite paths to reach that dream, but if that dream becomes real it lock that path in and all potential paths are systematically destroyed as we pick what path works for us.Likewise, God and Politics, both work in similar fashions.  What one person feels is Gods will today may become completely abstract to a similar person of faith.  Generalities remain the same but when you get into specifics it‚Äôs a where a lot of Christians will begin to disagree.  (Ask Church of Christ folks about their opinion on communion and baptism and compare it to Baptists or Methodists if your curious about what I mean)Likewise, in politics, politicians have to keep things rather vague. Even though they‚Äôve likely figured out the specifics of how they want to implement a plan, a supporter of the overall plan, may become a adversary if the misinterpreted the specifics of the plan.In politics specifically we have people that identify as part of a party, but as centrist know that‚Äôs not the end of it.  Many will identify simply as a supporter of a specific person but even that one politician will seldom subscribe to every plank of a partied platform.  Very interesting incite thank you for this. Absolutely, wouldn‚Äôt disagree there I have to admit it‚Äôs very awkward explaining to someone that I‚Äôm Republican.  Often, I have to gauge what their inclinations are; otherwise I risk losing potential friendships/networking connections/ and or becoming a social pariah.  In a few courses I‚Äôve taken over the years, I‚Äôve had on a few occasions gotten along great with a classmate, who happens to be a leftist.  They even expressed interest in the fact I‚Äôm a mod for Defranco... (the exact words one used was... ‚Äúdude did we just become best friends?!‚Äù). Then, he learned I‚Äôm also a Republican...  as an adamant AOC supporter, his face soured instantly, I very quickly had to explain I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúone of the those‚Äù kind of Republicans.  He still kept his distance for the remainder of the course. Between taking courses online and a conservative college I‚Äôve managed to avoid future negative encounters. I mean nicotine is a poison... This is why statistics can be manipulated Also military project so just add an extra 0 to the end because military contracts Language barriers may be a factor here.  But you can probably account for that.  A mod pool where we can borrow from would be useful. I honestly was just surprised that Vox has anything bad to say about reddits golden calf.  But yes this is kinda my beef with the article as well. Oh I thought you were talking about me. Phew. * limited government that sole purpose is to protect the citizens and provide a common infrastructure to the benefit of its people.* a government that does not pass its debt to the next generation but pays its debt as it is acquired* individual liberty over the opinions of the mob* a free market that is regulated only to a point that the citizen can feel safe in day to day commerce, which is to say that monopolies (be they local or national) should be prevented and dissolved.* basically everything about the American dream film cartoon* I believe that abortion is wrong but I believe that life does not begin at conception but instead when the heartbeat can be detected. This allows for both stemcell research and abortion due to unplanned/unwanted sex (aka rape). (I am in The miniority amoung this party). The reason I hold this opinion is it weakens the economy and americas future by forcing parents that are not ready to be parents to place themselves in potentionally bankrupting positions. Additionally, during midevil times it was not believed amoung early christians that life began at conception but instead when movement could be felt (this was called the quickening) and is more inline with traditional views. Again I am the minority here. That said, once the heartbeat is detected, adoption is a thing. Additionally the government has no obligation and should not in anyway support abortions.* gay marriage? According to religious doctrine it is a sin but that has no barring on what the governments stance on the matter should be. * a person should be secure in their home with their private documents to include those documents contained in electronic media.* civil asset forfeiture is against the constitution* net neutrality is an essential aspect of free speech.  To that end, Now, If we are going to treat ISPs like private companies, then they should be broken up and forced to compete under anti-trust laws as they clearly are operating as de facto local monopolies and seeking to become "ma Bell" in everything but name only. We really should treat ISPs as private companies and stop letting them get away with their various holds they have on small towns. Then they would be so busy competing with each other, they wouldn't have time to figure out new and better ways to screw their overly saturated market out of more money. Instead, they'd be focusing on their abysmal customer service records and making their services comparable to other providers in the western world... and Korea and Japan... and even china?Point is, we, as republicans, need to rethink net neutrality and how we approach the subject. I think that net neutrality should be protected in the same vein as the first amendment. And to protect it, we need ISPs to really start competing instead of this price fixing, local monopoly bull crap they keep jamming down our throats.* a government's ability to protect it citizens is measured solely by the morale and state of its military* society that values pragmatism over extreamist views, who values the views of all and not just a chosen few.* [there‚Äôs a lot more](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3lgny5/if_you_were_given_the_chance_to_run_an/cv66oq3/).

This popped in my normal news feed and I thought it was a good story to cover.  My bad. The aphorism "a rising tide lifts all boats" is associated with the idea that an improved economy will benefit all participants, and that economic policy, particularly government economic policy, should therefore focus on broad economic efforts.As the article itself states that the even the poorest Americans live better it a great example of this concept.

We had 30 people (mostly from the projared subreddit) try to brigade the sub with this question in the past 24 hours.  It seems to be dying off, but we would like to give it a little more time to cool off.  (Our weekend crowd is different than our weekday crowd) I really understand their frustration but it quickly evolves into ‚ÄúPhil sucks as a journalist‚Äù which we are not going to allow on this sub.  This sub is a fan sub after all. For a course I once took, the instructor once asked us to define the difference between terrorism, rebels, insurrectionist, and insurgents.  This was before we had internet in our pockets.  And at the conclusion, we discovered often it is a matter of perspective.  Great course, really challenged preconceptions about media reporting and single source issues.  Did you know that the US has nearly 23 different definitions of terrorism depending on what agency you‚Äôre dealing with?  When you deal with that level of nuance it‚Äôs really hard to be 100% certain the ‚Äúinsurgent‚Äù isn‚Äôt in-fact a terrorist and vice versa.  For those curious for the class the definition we adopted for terrorist are those that actively target innocents with violence to bring attention to their cause.Insurgents vs rebel is literally whether you support them or not.Insurrectionist is if they‚Äôve were part of that nation‚Äôs government and went rouge but still maintain a similar structure as they did before separation but want to take over the government.  Can‚Äôt blame Phil for not getting it straight it took four days before we could get that answer out.  And it is definitely a matter of opinion sometimes. This post was made about 12 hours after the start of the brigading.  It now has several upvotes (263). And the comment is near the top of the comment threads. The sub is under a brigading attack by a coordinated effort from the projarred sub Reddit.  We haven‚Äôt commented on it or discussed it up to this point because ‚Äúdon‚Äôt feed the trolls‚Äù.It started early morning yesterday with a few posts and has evolved somewhere close to 30 to 40 posts or comments.  We have contacted Reddit admins and requested assistance and the projared mods have asked them to stop brigading.  (Like that ever works)It would have been fine had it only been two or three people asking about the projared thing but when it became 7 or more, it was clear that it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúcriticism‚Äù it was trolling/brigading.  This triggered a massive sub clean up response.And before anyone asks, I don‚Äôt have an answer for the question they‚Äôre asking.  I am sure Phil has his reasons.  I haven‚Äôt been able to ask him about it.  But let me be perfectly clear, concern trolling is trolling for this instance as [that was their every intention made clear by this post](https://www.reddit.com/user/The_seph_i_am/comments/cxei2k/coordinated_brigading_from_projared_subreddit/). I understand their frustration but the people making comments haven‚Äôt even posted on this sub but a handful of times, if ever, and aren‚Äôt part of this subreddit community.  No further questions will be answered regarding this as I literally have no time and don‚Äôt speak for Phil.I am responding to you because you have in the past posted to this sub. This would make a really cool topic. Kind of reminds me of the earth final conflict scene were they implant a chip that lets the guys use his arm weapon. Seems like a perfectly reasonable request.  In fact, it seems like that should come out in the discovery process.  You know what would also be reasonable?

UBI isn‚Äôt libertarian?](https://en.meming.world/images/en/a/af/Surprised_Pikachu_3D.jpg) Well until you have to pay for their retirement- congress-members (Probably) I‚Äôd be game for a cleaner energy solution that involves nuclear for sure. I think I‚Äôm gonna have to slightly disagree with u/PopCultureNerd characterization here.  I think Youtube should get out of the censorship game.  It‚Äôs starting premise was all about sharing of content that main television couldn‚Äôt, or wouldn‚Äôt handle... al la Janet Jackson ‚Äúwardrobe malfunction‚Äù.  Phil‚Äôs talked about those ‚ÄúWild West days‚Äù in the past, and the days where Youtube didn‚Äôt heavily censor its content is honestly why so many people were drawn to Youtube.  You had a space where you could express your content the way you wanted and became rewarded for it if other liked it.Today, due to a whole host of reasons (such as: advertising, illegal content, pressure from pearl clutching sensationalist, bad press, etc.) youtube has been forced to loss a lot of that identity.  The main argument I hear regarding this issue asks ‚Äúis youtube a platform or a publisher?‚Äù.  If it‚Äôs a publisher then it can selectively choose between what it chooses to allow on its website and what it doesn‚Äôt but it is held liable for what it allows.  If it‚Äôs a platform, then it‚Äôs no different than if a it was a city square, or public space: it is open to anyone not doing anything illegal but that‚Äôs the only line it can draw, because free speech actually applies here.Youtube currently is somewhere in the middle and when it‚Äôs in the middle you end up with nuances that leave everyone frustrated.  I talked about this a little more two weeks ago [when the LGQT youtubers were suing Youtube](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeFranco/comments/cqhpjr/wed_wow_youtubers_sue_youtube_for_unfair/ewwulnn/?context=3) for basically the same issue that pragerU has with Youtube.   Be they Conservative or Liberal, I disagree with the approach Youtube has taken lately with moderating their website as  of late and they may be opening themselves up to legal problems if they continue down this path. I actually use the wrong sign for this exact reason. Some people use dark humor to deal with life and death situations.  You see it with doctors, nurse, and especially military.  But around kids?  Time and place man... time and place. The mention of the Koch brothers evoke a very strong reaction to me because of the way their network treated Kasich.  Often they‚Äôre demonized as the ‚Äúsorous of the Republican Party‚Äù.  I‚Äôve never seen anything to believe they merited it being to that levels of puppet mastery. But they did have some considerable influence and if not for them, I think Kasich would have had a stronger chance.All that said, may Mr Koch be judged by a merciful God as I pray we all are. So he was fired because he was extremely pro life?  That smacks of something illegal or at the very least dishonest to journalistic integrity and their devotion to freedom of speech. I think a company knowing that you have incentive that you‚Äôll stay with them for at least four years so long as you get the hours may give them some ability to be more open to hiring first job employees.  Especially if they can say something like they match every dollar you add to the fund to qualify you for a higher pay out later.There are a lot of positive possibilities here and a lot of room for carrots and sticks to entice both federal and local lawmakers as well as various companies. So under this plan what incentive does someone have to just not pay it back? And maybe that can be an option, 3% gets you a community college, 8% gets you state colleges.  Even the GI bill won‚Äôt cover the more expensive private school.  The 9/11 for instance will only cover the most expensive state school in the state you attend college in.Additionally, what a lot of people don‚Äôt realize is if you‚Äôve been independent of your parents for four years, earning your own income, then FAFSA/Pell grant will typically cover a lot of your tuition.  Where people ‚Äúmess up‚Äù IMO is they go straight to college after high school.  That works for driven people but a lot of others just dick around not knowing what to do with their life, and end up in debt for a piece paper that likely doesn‚Äôt reflect the students actual career path... [at least according to this article back in 2013](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/05/20/only-27-percent-of-college-grads-have-a-job-related-to-their-major/), which states 27% of college grads have jobs related to their careers.  There are many factors for this (career-field demand, finding out you don‚Äôt actually like the job, better pay in other careers, job stability), but I think a lot of it is due to asking 18-21 year olds who have no adult life experience to pick a career and be saddled with debt is another major factor. This is kinda who I was thinking of as the target demographic, those in poverty get FASFA/Pell grants. Next scene is everyone dying from oxygen depletion [OP posted links to each post three hours before his one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/centrist/comments/ctze9y/i_made_a_tally_of_the_last_20_top_voted_posts_of/expekfh/) > probably require a lot of unpleasant compromises.   The big question is probably going to be who are we all willing to compromise with and about what. And I think that‚Äôs why trump exists.The idea that there has to be a perfect compromise but what that compromise is... well no one knows... meanwhile the ultra conservatives know exactly what they want. . . A non PC nationalist.  In the absence of other choices that moderates can agree on, hardline conservatives run the roost.  Honestly I think anyone can do it provided two things go for them: They can completely ignore President Trump‚Äôs barbs as the troll he is and get get the ‚Äúshinny object‚Äù media to give them more attention than trumps antics gain.  The first is easy the second... not so much. Especially since they won‚Äôt even let Weld even try to debate him. I had hoped Mathis might after having to leave so publicly frustrated with the administration.  There hasn‚Äôt been a prior active duty candidate since bush senior and the military is a historically strong republican voting block. I‚Äôve been called an extreme right wing conservative simply because I lean a [little right.](https://www.reddit.com/user/The_seph_i_am/comments/cr4wmq/this_is_where_i_fall_on_political_charts/).  As this is a recent development, it seems leftists on Reddit do not accept moderate capitalists in any form.  From my perspective this pushes a lot of moderates away from the left.  They don‚Äôt want the hardcore nationalist policies of the extreme right either, but if you‚Äôre looking for anything that bashes the right you need only look so far as r/politics.  To get anything that even criticizes the left, you have to either go places like r/Republican, r/conservative.  A lot of moderate capitalists wouldn‚Äôt necessarily identify as republican so they end up here.  r/Tuesday is also a good one as they have rules about extreme partisanship/tribalism but they are explicitly a ‚Äúmoderate Republican  leaning sub‚Äù Something I never understood. How do they not vilify him as much as republicans because of his anti homosexual policies? To add to this, there was a study of what effect the teen mom shows had on the sexually active teens and in areas where abstinence only education was taught.  [The show had actual positive effects on preventing teen pregnancy](https://www.wellesley.edu/news/2014/04/node/41168).  Sometimes people just need to see the consequences of giving into hormones without any consideration for the future. [Not to mention H1B visa program have been extremely abused in the past.](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/tourism/os-bz-disney-lawsuit-workers-20180508-story.html) and likely we would see the same things happen with the H2B if any lessening occurs.For those not familiar with the difference between the two [click here](http://www.pollakimmigration.com/blog/differences-between-the-h1b-visa-and-h2b-visa).  Any loosening of temp workers (H2B) restrictions will likely result in a constant flow of temp workers as companies seek to prevent hiring full time employees.Point 5 (processing at ports) has some merit though.  Generally, I for making immigration easier by hiring more immigration judges and building out the infrastructure required to process people in a timely manner.  (It shouldn‚Äôt take 9 months to two years just to get the green card and another four to become a citizen). I think increasing funding so the immigration courts can handle influx is worth the investment.  A reasonable timeline to me is two to four months for a work visa, one month max for asylum seeker visas, and a year max for citizenship.  That said, I don‚Äôt want to people to think I am advocating open boarders either. * The immigrant must be willing to integrate into society.  They‚Äôre choosing America as their new home.  That means our cultures too. * I really think they should speak English and that an American English course could be provided for those that can‚Äôt. (Likely through charity or augmented through processing fees of everyone entering this country that can speak American English) there is a few reasons I think this necessary: one it ensures the new citizen has the ability to not be fleeced by those that would take advantage of a non native speaker, and ensures they are not tied solely to their sponsor for support.  A lot of traffic victims are unable to speak English and their captors use that to their advantage.  Two, speaking English well simply gives you such a far better opportunity to succeed in the US than not that, in my mind, it shouldn‚Äôt even be a debate.  It‚Äôs absolutely fine to be bilingual but not being able to speak English at all in the US is just asking to be set up for failure.* Pass the citizenship test.  Even asylum seekers.* Pass a fairly stringent background check and ensure they aren‚Äôt on a terrorism watch list or have familial ties to terrorist or gangs.  This is currently being abused to keep families in detention, I understand that! but there definitely needs to be some version of thisAlso, fix the damn processing faculties.  It‚Äôs an embarrassment that the greatest country in the world doesn‚Äôt have better accommodations for those seeking amnesty and citizenship than to have them sleep on the floor in open bays. Oh I know.  I was actually curious if this new revision of standards was also going to include a increased crackdown on those comments.  But it is what it is what is.  I will attempt to be more vocal in the future to add the ‚Äúconservative voice‚Äù that appears to be lacking. That‚Äôs a valid point.And for 90% I agree.  He only remaining 10% is that part about private business, can make the requirements of their employees as they deem fit.  Using your example about a burka, it could be argued that it‚Äôs the uniform they have to wear, like a waiter has to wear black pants at a certain restaurant.  I again see your point about the forcing religion aspect but if the Christian owner of the company set the rules for their company and you choose to work for that person it kinda still that Christian person practice of religion.> As I said, the conservative right has places where they have footing to disagree with the democrats.I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt see that part of your comment in the post I responded too. So who‚Äôs rights do you trample on to allow for the other person‚Äôs rights?  The Christian Right to practice religion or the Transgendered person right to identify?In this situation it seems like no matter what, someone‚Äôs going to be the villain.

Almost as if private sector is better at preparing kids than the government...Edit:  don‚Äôt understand the downvotes.  The school voucher program is built on the concept that public schools are ill equipped to handle teaching students compared to private sector education.  The local government recognizes this fact and instead of forcing your kids to attend public school it gives you a chance to receive a better quality education. This study shows that school vouchers work and work well. [Regarding homelessness I think private charities are far better equipped but local governments tend to stifle the effort quite considerably](https://youtu.be/n6h7fL22WCE) Regarding wage equality [I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs something we should force on anyone](https://youtu.be/KqUgHuHmbzo). That‚Äôs where Incentivized wage thresholds comes in!There‚Äôs a different alternative to both raising minimum wage and UBI called incentivizing wage thresholds. Basically, if your company pays all its employees a certain % above the poverty line, not to include benefits or bonuses, then your company is entitled to a tax credit.This doesn‚Äôt punish companies that can‚Äôt afford to pay their employees this threshold while at the same time encourages companies to provide for its lowest entry level employees.There a few variations to this approach often with nationalism consideredBut this approach does work with [supply sided economic theory](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgeleef/2013/12/06/trickle-down-economics-the-most-destructive-phrase-of-all-time/)The reason I‚Äôve never liked the concept of UBI is summed up pretty well in this article:[‚ÄúIn a free society, wealth doesn‚Äôt trickle down, or up, or sideways. It is earned.‚Äú](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-conservatives-still-believe-in-trickle-down-economics)The way I‚Äôd like to implement it [I‚Äôve brought up before](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3fokbf/what_are_the_alternatives_to_raising_minimum_wage/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=u_The_seph_i_am&utm_content=t1_dydiklx) but because it runs counter to UBI (reddit‚Äôs Golden calf IMO) it is typically neglected as a serious alternative.Which is a shame because I‚Äôd love to refine the idea and try to get it implemented as a fiscally conservative alternative to forcing minimum wage on companies that may not be able to afford it while at the same time giving smaller businesses a chance to compete with larger corporations in regards to taking on higher qualified people.Because not every company will be able to do this it also does not put strains on inflation but it does put more the spending power in the hands of lower and middle classes who sales tax and income tax increase, which if done properly, could potentially mean neutral or even a gain in overall tax revenue.Because this rate is pegged to a certain percentage above the poverty line it also ensures that yearly pay wages keep up with inflation, meaning the spending power doesn‚Äôt diminish.That said it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfree money‚Äù nor does it remove money already stored by plutocrats and give it directly to the people, so therefore it will likely get roasted by UBI supporters, liberals and socialists and it isn‚Äôt an abolishment of the minimum wage, so it doesn‚Äôt really interest the conservative or anacap crowds. In terms of centerists, it gets tepid approval/rejection because it comes off as complicating and adding more loopholes to the tax codes at best and the government picking winners and losers at worse. Still it‚Äôs a compromise that isn‚Äôt socialism!I still think it could work and have been looking for any politician that could draft it up as a proposal just to get it out there and debated seriously. To find what the ideal percentage would be, to figure out what the right tax incentives would be.Sadly, it‚Äôs not UBI so I can‚Äôt get reddit to look at it in this context, instead the responses usually boil down to ‚ÄúUBI is the only way‚Äù so ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to waste time on this other method... don‚Äôt you know automation is coming!?‚ÄùThis method could work for that too by adding an additional tax incentive hiring higher ratios of humans per automated industry.Basically we shouldn‚Äôt punish ingenuity and companies trying to make a profit but should encourage companies that have their employees best interests at heart.If minimum wage and UBI is the stick incentived wage thresholds are carrot.Another thing to remember is a rising tide raises all ships is as true statement today as it was in the 70s 80s and 90s > The woman proceeded to lecture them, saying that though it might appear her actions were racially motivated, ‚Äúit ain‚Äôt about that,‚Äù according to the arrest report.

What‚Äôs it like to live with optimism about the administration?  (Asking for a Freind) So the argument (as I understand it from the whole [Crowder fiasco](https://youtu.be/u1zVdZ6azpU?t=3m10s) about two month...ish ago) stems from whether youtube is by legal definition a ‚Äúpublisher‚Äù or ‚Äúplatform.‚Äù  Publishers can curate their stuff by choosing not to hire certain authors but they‚Äôre held liable for what is said on their media.  (Newspapers, and the like). Platforms are not held liable for what content they host because they don‚Äôt curate their content they simply offer a stage for the madness.  And whoever has said what was said on the stage is the guilty party and not the owner of the stage.  Overly simplified, as long as nothing illegal is hosted on that stage restriction on what is said in a public space is (potentially) a infringement of free speech.  Social media like YouTube and Facebook get to play in a middle ground between the two and the lawsuits against them would likely clarify which is which. The victims absolutely should get justice.  In the case of the Boy Scouts, they‚Äôre simply aren‚Äôt that organization anymore.  I definitely think BSA tried to get away with it in the past! But today?  And for at least the past 10 to 15 years, they truly have cleaned up their act.  Every time I've seen an article about the thousands of victims that were hurt by the Scouts it‚Äôs almost always counting a time where scouting DID cover that shit up in the 60‚Äôs though 80‚Äôs.  And in those cases, the victims should get everything thats due to them.  But the other side of this is that scouting isn‚Äôt that organization anymore.  It would be like getting sent to jail for something your parents did.  They‚Äôve done so much to clean up their image that today scouting is called [‚Äúthe gold standard‚Äù for child protection rules for youth organizations according to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/dvp/PreventingChildSexualAbuse.pdf)Should that count for anything? (I honestly don‚Äôt know!). A literal lifetime of abuse and coverups covered with a single decade of wholesome goodness is likely not enough.  The only thing I do know is this: if these series of lawsuits ‚Äúkills‚Äù the scouting I and my kids know today for the crimes of what amounts to a different entity, as an Eagle Scout, I wouldn‚Äôt know how feel beyond sadness both for the millions of young men and women (Boy Scouts opened their services to women about two years ago by the way) that will miss out on the confidence, leadership skills and over all life skills I still use well into my 30‚Äôs; but also (especially) for victims that have had to endure so much and have likely had the exact opposite experience scouting was meant to provide.  (Specifically the confidence and life coping skills that were robbed from them.)It‚Äôs is just a shitty situation no matter how I look at it and my heart breaks.  Hopefully, there is an amicable solution but I doubt it. This is an effort I applaud but laugh at how ridiculous it would be to enforce. Coerced to do their best Col Clink impression...

A new space race, could possibly do the same for military transportation and force projection.I must admit I am quite in awe (both terrified and excited) of what that could mean.  Space tech is the best way to bring about a new era of technology.  Imagine if something like a space carrier did become a thing.  What that could mean for the civilian sector.  Space travel would be as simple as getting on a boat is today!But it can be used for such worse things...Duality of man... am I right? It‚Äôs interesting that despite his percentage being one of the lowest in individual small donations that President Trump ended up being the highest total wise.

Apologies but this violates our misleading/clickbait title rule.

I‚Äôm not convinced video games are the thing to focus on here though.  It was doing great until that point. I was about to say, I thought this sounded familiar.Seems like every 4-6 years someone gets it in their head that security trumps privacy. At first we thought that this was a joke and a good ribbing.  That is not what the OP intended and was actually meant as a criticism.

Hi welcome. We allow criticism of Phil and the PDS but try to make it productive criticism. If you are going to offer criticism, it needs to be constructive, solution oriented, and respectful. Try to see it from all sides, this will save everyone time and more than likely actually get positive responses from everyone involved. Slinging what amounts to hate will be a bannable offense.

So let me get this straight this is news coverage about news coverage? "You pass butt napkins" Fun fact, decentralized groups, are actually why its so hard to target terrorist groups like AQ, TB and ISIS.  Even if you take out "head leadership" the "groups" still function. This is why I don't get the argument that it has to be a "centralized" entity for it to be considered a terrorist organization. > The final rule excludes from the Volcker Rule banks with:* $10 billion or less in total consolidated assets, and* total trading assets and liabilities that amount to 5 percent or less of their total consolidated assets.So won‚Äôt this just cause more shell companies?

But you see butter is made from cows.  Cows are bad for environment so instead of butter we give you cancer causing margarine instead.  Much better for environment because made from plants. I‚Äôm actually curious what this smells like. This is true in many levels. UBI is really really bad math for me.  Seems nice enough but I can‚Äôt get on board with redistribution of wealth. Someone needs a nap... and a chew toy...Seriously seems like my kids when they were three and too tired to know what‚Äôs good for them. Probably waiting for more details. You‚Äôre not the first person I‚Äôve met from there that has expressed these same sentiments. His family must be devastated.  I‚Äôve been watching his channel for a long time and his wife and kids were always part of it.  I‚Äôm not surprised how he died (it actually seems rather fitting to his character), just surprised that he‚Äôs dead.  I‚Äôm at a loss for words... Wait... people still play counter strike?  Huh... neatBut for each of those do they draw the kind of crowd we saw in the video?  If so, I‚Äôd definitely say it‚Äôs a successful e-sport that will last. That and the ‚Äúpop up‚Äù when selecting a post is cancer for narrow screens. I think the mistake e-sports programs make is building their tournaments around specific platforms or a specific game.  Usually these games don‚Äôt last past 3 years and that‚Äôs not enough time to build a brand.  There are exceptions Starcraft for instance has lasted forever in Korea. I think if an e-sport is going to be taken more seriously, the tournament has to break past that three year mark and at least 6 years.  Halo came real close, as has CoD.  But games that can last longer are extremely rare. Happy cake day u/willphule, one of our most frequent posters.  Seriously, it‚Äôs like you enjoy this or something.  Thanks for all the posts.

My guess is it is because if they‚Äôre successful it will only give Pence 6 months at most before re-elections.  If they had done it any sooner they‚Äôd have to deal with a ultra hardline conservative.  You thought their hate for Trump was bad... ya ain‚Äôt seen nothing yet.

Well if this makes it to Supreme Court I wonder what will happen Fiscal conservatives hate it because of the cost, progressives and globalists hate it because it‚Äôs the opposite of ‚Äúopen border‚Äù. Constitutionalist hate it because of what it represents in terms of checks and balances.  Nationalist like it because it reduces the influx by ‚Äúa number‚Äù.... so not ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù but damn near close.Sometimes I wonder...for the amount of money they will really spend on a completed wall, could they build a hypertube, with solar and wind generators that runs the entire border?You‚Äôd still effectively divide the two areas, and at least it would be an infrastructure improvement and generate income while potentially connecting Tampa to Vegas and everywhere in between.But sadly...

Apologies but This video has been posted already.  Therefore I‚Äôve had to remove this post.Here: https://www.reddit.com/r/DeFranco/comments/ci2t4f/attention_youtube_the_clock_is_ticking_youtubers/ Transparency-publish all rules. I think this is the right thing to do.  However, I‚Äôm not sure google even has this ability to this since it‚Äôs done by learning algorithm bots.Justify all demonetization - this should have been standard since the start.  It‚Äôs just proper moderation policy to at least tell someone which rule they broke.  Human being POC -  I think upon reaching that silver play button status you should be should be assigned a caseworker/POC at youtube.  Anyone below that threshold... call center?Establish neutral judges - this sounds like they want an arbitration clause and while admirable I can‚Äôt see it being practical.  Between different state and ‚ÄúStates‚Äù Jurisdictions and the shear number of youtubers, I don‚Äôt see google being able to do this in a satisfactory manner.  I‚Äôm hoping the guild has options to present because it IS something needed especially when one Youtuber is demonetized while a different one isn‚Äôt for covering the same story.Let us participate:  yes please!  But how.  The Crowder/Maza situation highlighted a serious schism between different sides of youtube and to give a voice to one and not another would defeat the purpose but one side doesn‚Äôt even think the other should have a voice because even acknowledging them gives undue attention.   Sprave (the slingshot channel) specifically is kind of an example of this.  There is a solid argument from one side that Youtube shouldn‚Äôt be in the business teaching people how to make the ~~weapons~~ ‚Äútoys‚Äù Sprave makes.  On the other, education, entertainment and YouTube‚Äôs viewing audiences clearly wants that content!  So how and what format should ‚Äúparticipation‚Äù take?  Unions normally approach the companies they work for with united fronts.  But youtubers are anything but unified.  Factions are sure!  I will be interesting to see how this works out/ if it works out.  A potential solution might end up being multiple unions representing different factions but that decrease the barging power of the union.  With a rep from each faction getting a seat at the table provided they have represent a certain minimum fraction of youtubers.I love the slingshot channel.  I think his and manny other youtubers like him have gotten a raw deal as of late with YouTube‚Äôs current ‚Äúadvertiser friendly‚Äù model it‚Äôs adopted.  Changing that model that will work better for the all three parties: advertisers, youtubers and google is absolutely the right step.  I hope it works out for them.All that said, if this Youtuber union does become a thing, would it be the largest union on the planet? A reminder.  Please keep posts civil and hear out opposing view points.

Absolutely, definitely NOT enough to convict but certainly enough for a warrant. Absolutely true.  Now if those same people were in multiple convicted pedo and sex traffickers phones... that would be a little more suspect. What kinda stuff made it so bad?  Only time I lived on base was Hawaii over a decade ago. Republican checking in, honestly could care less about the color of her skin.  There are conservatives that do... I won‚Äôt deny that...however, those that do are an extremely small part of conservatives and the majority in the circles I hang out with give too shits about her race, gender or origins. They don‚Äôt like her because of those very ideas that make her popular among left.  She‚Äôs too ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù socialist, and that is enough for them.  They see her popularity and get concerned.Me, I think she‚Äôs someone who brings ridicule on herself for various statements but ignore her like I do most extremists in politics.  (Sadly I wish trump could also be ignored)... but I digressPoint is there is a reason beyond ‚Äúbrown people bad‚Äù for those on the right to not like her. It has been absolutely noble and praise worthy the courage it has taken for many of the victims to come forward to bring their assaulters to justice.  It truly is heroic and hope what I write next does not dismiss their claims but a small concern I‚Äôve had in all this is the movement has, on a few occasions, ignored why trial in the court of public opinion is so dangerous...  It lacks due process.

[So answers with joe did a video on potential mega projects for combating man made climate change](https://youtu.be/GfRo8_RfefA) I think at the time, a lot was top secret.  Rockets at the time were heavily tied to the defense department. One thing the video kinda dismisses is the fact that the Space Race was every bit about about ICBMs as much as it was about the ‚ÄúNoble cause of defeating communism‚Äù.I can‚Äôt think of such a massive engineering project other than space that could have yielded such fruit.  What do you have in mind? I think Phil even mentioned that in last weeks episode... maybe I believe the space program is an exceptional tool for the benefit of all Americans.  I remember one estimate that states for every 1 dollar spent of the space program it has generated $14 for the economy and impact on out current tech that is incalculable.I cannot stress enough the importance of making space a a priority in terms of budgeting. Man I [wish.](https://np.reddit.com/r/DeFranco/comments/cekaxj/wed_wow_huge_faceapp_security_controversy_baby/eu36mxn/) Swear I even see a smirk at a certain point. Remember how we learned from the last election that then Candidate Trump‚Äôs outrageous comments were basically free advertising for the Trump campaign.  It‚Äôs at this moment I just realized that he‚Äôs trying to do it again.The republic is falling indeed... Truth Gawd I wish they (GOP leaders) would listen and actually stop being such hypocrites.   Sadly, that doesn‚Äôt seem in the cards.Edit:  it‚Äôs not too late Dems don‚Äôt become us > US is by FAR the highest. So what exactly do you think is working well?I don‚Äôt think you read my original post very throughly, as that‚Äôs was kinda the point. I already explained that.  The US government sucks at finding cost effective actions Too unquantifiable. The definition of healthy is too subjective. > Canadian governmentThat‚Äôs great for them.  Have you seen how much the US pays for a toilet seat for the military?Regarding the second point.  That‚Äôs where I draw the line.  You read my first post so you know my stance on education. Because you‚Äôre not forcing someone else to pay for that. Additionally, government paying for things usually results in increased prices.  The US government sucks at negotiating  costs for cheap and instead usual ends up just cutting quality.Instead, I think the movement towards published price points for hospitals and doctors should be a norm.  This allows consumers to price shop and compare.  This is usually why we hold lasic as the go to example.  Price competition drove the surgery to far cheaper costs. Oh absolutely Republicans are playing the identity politics card WAY too much.  I feel the increase in this stemmed from Trump‚Äôs influence.> I'd love to hear your definition of socialism.I‚Äôm gonna take this as a sincere request.  But this isn‚Äôt cap vs soc so hopefully we can keep it civil.In general, those advocating for UBI or Single payer universal healthcare are where I draw the line as where it is a step too far regarding socialism.  I do feel there are alternatives to these solutions which [I‚Äôve discussed at length in the past](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/8gooqg/everyone_how_would_you_eliminate_the_wealth/dydiklx/) but they‚Äôre not commonly considered.  That‚Äôs my opinion and you‚Äôre free to disagree.  That‚Äôs the beautiful thing about opinions!That said, I only brought it up to explain that behind the curtain, most Republicans hear ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù (‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù or ‚Äúnot‚Äù) and it‚Äôs enough to stoke enough fear to keep President Trump in office.  Both parties have moved more extreme over time.  12 years ago Uncle Bernie was more or less considered a nut within his own party.  Today, many of the candidates echo his views.  16 years ago, respectful men that refused to even acknowledge the ‚Äúbirther‚Äù movement or other racial overtones and would chastise anyone who brought it up during political rallies were the Republican Nominees.  (Again we have Trump‚Äôs influence to thank for that one)Apologies if I did not make that more clear in my original post. My entire post was a rebuke of BOTH parties.  How was that not clear? Okay then.   Maybe sooner than that.  Wasn‚Äôt that the whole Pizza gate thing? I read that in Shatner‚Äôs voice. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs gotten quite to that level but it‚Äôs not hard to imagine it going that way after another year. Regarding the trump situation: I fear he is correct.  I‚Äôm a Republican and am utterly disgusted, disappointed and incensed regarding President Trump behavior and attitude towards his fellow Americans.  I wish like hell he wasn‚Äôt president (didn‚Äôt vote for him if your curious).  Neither party is really morally just in my eyes, (Dems because of the identity politics and inability to hold  the socialist tendencies of the party at bay; republicans because of their inability to rebuke a pompous ass that wields an ‚Äúalt‚Äùernate version of identity politics, an inability to reign in government spending, and an inability hold to the principal ‚Äúone nation under God‚Äù... emphasize on the ‚Äúone nation‚Äù). Since I was a child, Republicans were the party that proudly stood by the side of those they didn‚Äôt agree with because it was ‚Äúthat person‚Äôs right to speak as an American‚Äù.  They believed in ‚Äúindividual rights over the needs of society‚Äù a true pursuit of liberty.  All I see today, and have seen since the middle of Former President Obama‚Äôs second term, is the needs of the conglomerate over the needs of anyone else.President Trump IS good for the economy.  (Debate it as you will regarding whether the way we measure that economy is good for the lowest income but it is fact).  But I think that‚Äôs all he‚Äôs been good for... maybe finishing off ISIS, history will have to be the judge on that one.I believe in the principles of American exceptionalism.  We should be first in the world!... for education, diplomacy, power projection  (strong and soft power), ability to enter in well paying careers (note there is a difference between career and ‚Äújob‚Äù), technology, energy production, space, caring for our environment.  And we‚Äôve done nothing to improve any of it beyond rhetoric and minor bumps that are within statistical margins of error so either side can argue either way.To piggyback on what Phil said, about President Trump‚Äôs base and the way he manipulates it, from a Republican side, AOC and her ilk are terrifying.  Trump could literally just run on the fear she generates from being an admitted socialist and likely stir enough votes to keep him office. She‚Äôs not even a candidate and  he could still run his whole campaign based on her.  (She is that polarizing).  So long as socialism is the face of the party you will never get conservative to jump ship.  If America wants Mr. Trump out that‚Äôs all the Dems have to do is rebuke itself for going too far left (much as we wish the Republicans would rebuke themselves for the reasons mentioned above), and they could maybe do something.We‚Äôre so concerned about what ‚Äúthe other‚Äù is doing we fail to look at our own parties and tell them to ‚Äúknock it off! Get back to work‚Äù Out of fear that it would give the other side enough influence to push us out of power.  And what really bugs me, is a I know this plea will fall on deaf ears.  AOC and Sen Bernie‚Äôs supporters are just as avid as President Trump‚Äôs and they will likely just dismiss my call for a more moderate political sphere and instead find some fault in what I wrote and move on... But just in case they haven‚Äôt, thanks for taking time to read the rantings of a disenfranchised American Republican all the same. I agree however, there is one instance where I think it might make sense.  Having someone state side that can manage your affairs is a lot easier if it‚Äôs your wife than girlfriend.  (Yes that‚Äôs what powers of attorneys are for! But there‚Äôs still a little more trust and power if it‚Äôs your wife than girlfriend) All that said, that‚Äôs NOT a valid reason to get married.  And definitely avoid having kids for like four or five years.  28 or older with knowing the person for 8 years is usually what I recommend for the time line for kids.  (As Chris Titus has said, after 8 years you can‚Äôt hide crazy after that point)Marriage (divorce) before kids is just a roommate with benefits.  After kids, that‚Äôs where the real pain is.Edit: in fact, now that I think about it.  Just have him watch Titus‚Äôs Love is Evol and The Born with a Defect specials Phil employs A LOT of people vs most regular Youtubers is why I think it‚Äôs not a one to one comparison. > There is nothing which I dread so much as a division of the republic into two great parties, each arranged under its leader, and concerting measures in opposition to each other. This, in my humble apprehension, is to be dreaded as the greatest political evil under our Constitution.John Adams, The Works Of John Adams, Second President Of The United States I think he did it because he wanted to draw attention away from the whole ‚Äúeven Mike Pence is concerned about the border detention facilities‚Äù thing.

It‚Äôs fine to have political beliefs but don‚Äôt let politics rule your life.  There‚Äôs other more fulfilling pursuits. This post has a tendency to go pretty partisan (not without reason).

You don‚Äôt go to see the avengers to hear about UBI, you don‚Äôt watch a basketball game to hear about the latest tax cut. I understand the appeal to want to use those platforms as a soap box (because it appeals to a larger audience) but that larger audience is large precisely because it ‚Äúnon partisan‚Äù.

With Disney plus and that DC thing, If I want what I had with Netflix 7 years ago (when they had everything) I may have to pay more than a basic cable package.  Still way worth it cost comparison wise.  But the cost is getting up there. Literally an hour after I posted this, I got a call from ‚ÄúAT&T Alert: Telemarketer.‚Äù  Usually would just say some random town in my area code.  Don‚Äôt know why it took so long to get to this point but I‚Äôm grateful. They used too.  That‚Äôs true.  But in u/INTHERORY defense.Today, the way the programs are it‚Äôs taken extremely seriously.  The restricted vs unrestricted process is designed to give the victim as much comfort as possible.  Restricted does inhibit criminal procedures but still allows access to therapy  that is the victims choice.  Unrestricted triggers a criminal investigation, allows the commander To be informed of the situation so they can move the alleged victim and alleged assaulter into different shops or shifts while the investigation is conducted.  The report is then tracked by both the sexual assault response coordination officer who answers to IG not the commander (and in the case of the Air Force, their version of the FBI called the Office of Special investigations).  The SARC officer acts as a guide and councilor for the victim.The problem is the investigation can take months to years and by the time it‚Äôs concluded the individuals (accused and victim) could have naturally moved onto a new assignment location.  There was also a issue where commanders would slow roll the investigation but they don‚Äôt have that ability anymore.The Air Force also started the red dot green dot program about three years ago (which is a joke at this point on how much the training is forced on people...It‚Äôs a dark humor).  Army, navy marines, have similar programs.The training encourages bystander intervention and ensures everyone understands the reporting process.  Sexual assault advocates are given privacy protections that even supervisors can‚Äôt override so victims can speak with confidence.I‚Äôve helped people get in contact with sexual assault advocates in the past and the situation was resolved in a manner that gave the victim every possible consideration.  They took that shit seriously.  All of that said!!!! Not everyone‚Äôs perfect and the military is YUGE (it‚Äôs the largest employer in the world).  So the chances are there will be things that fall through the cracks but the system is designed to give them every consideration. How would you enforce this overdose law?Will it apply to the pharmacist who is just fulfilling the prescription?  is this a way to target illegal drug dealers once marijuana becomes legal?Or is it something else? In land nav, my instructor wasn‚Äôt pleased when I told him he was wrong about where he said we were.  (I‚Äôve been using maps like this since I was a Cub Scout and even won a land nav competition once). He thought I was cheating when I triangulated our position within five feet of where the GPS put us.  The reason was because I understood how to read contour map lines and pointed out that we couldn‚Äôt be where he said we were because that would mean we were on a cliff.  (You‚Äôd think a land nav instructor would know this) The boy must learn. This is why we shouldn‚Äôt let kids watch FNAF play throughs Regarding this topic I‚Äôve always asked why not both?

Thanks to the third person view the vehicle provides, you also have a higher chance of seeing it being stuck.But that trip mine is neutral color, is more powerful, doesn‚Äôt make much noise, and detonates on contact, leaving you little to no time to react.I‚Äôll admit though there isn‚Äôt really much difference and it still takes a bit of ‚Äúsomething the others didn‚Äôt‚Äù beyond skill. It‚Äôs honestly, moves like this that made me hate the trip mines.  (A 2 second arming delay... SOMETHING to give drivers a chance at avoiding them).  By default, I‚Äôm a driver or pilot.

It‚Äôs simple you kill the rooster and have it for dinner... wait... what was that about socks? Sadly this is a truth of legislation.We forget [brown vs board of education and Green v. New Kent County](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/05/the-radical-supreme-court-decision-that-america-forgot/561410/) was also legislation through judicial activism.  We point at things like Roe vs Wade and Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, citizens united as over reaches of the judicial system But the truth is we call it judicial activism only when it‚Äôs on the wrong side of history at the moment we interpret it.Today, we don‚Äôt question someone‚Äôs right to an attorney (Gideon v. Wainwright, 1963) or their Miranda rights but these too were a result of judicial legislation via [Supreme Court decision.](https://www.smokeball.com/blog/8-of-the-most-controversial-famous-supreme-court-cases/) and for those who enjoy non vaginal sex, you‚Äôre probably grateful for Lawrence v. Texas.There are probably many on the left that don‚Äôt agree with District of Columbia v. Heller, 2008 (5-4 decision) which states Citizens have a right to possess firearms at home for self-defense.My point, (if I even have a point) is judicial legislation can be a bad thing and a good thing, much like congress and the executive branch (looking at you FCC).  Judicial legislation has been used to shape our laws and government since the 1800‚Äôs.  Treating it like it‚Äôs anomaly IMO, shows a lack of maturity on the matter.  Fact is sometimes congress is too inflexible to do the right thing.  On those rare occasions where congress is incapable of action the judicial and executive branches kinda have to pick up the slack.All that said, that doesn‚Äôt mean it can be reliable, in fact, it can get things horribly wrong from time to time.  And we should treat it like the ticking time bomb it is and take executive actions/memos/orders and law suits like this extremely seriously.  That‚Äôs actually why I find this law suit so interesting it has potential to have a massive impact.

If there are then Alabama argues that illegal immigrants should also not be counted.Additionally they argue that under article one that an illegal immigrant is not ‚Äúa person in each state‚Äù.I don‚Äôt care either way but I find the outcome of this extremely fascinating.  Mainly the stretches in logic they have to make to get to this point. I don‚Äôt know.  My thought is that Alabama will approach it the same way that FISA approaches it; essentially that [illegal immigrants are a ‚Äúnon US person‚Äù](https://fas.org/irp/nsa/standards.html) and thus not subject to the same protections or processes.  Though that is Fourth Amendment law so... maybe this will cause the two amendments to have to marry up. Exactly there are several secondary effects which would be a serious issue.That said Alabama may be going off how [FISA interprets fourth amendment protections](https://fas.org/irp/nsa/standards.html), essentially rendering illegal immigrants a ‚Äúnon US person‚Äù.  Though the two amendments aren‚Äôt related, I wouldn‚Äôt put it past them. Love that video Smart man.  That‚Äôs still very cool.

There‚Äôs a link to message the mods on the right of the tool bar and anyone can posts a text post with the ‚Äúmeta‚Äù flair offering up the suggestion.  The post you‚Äôre referring to is from when Phil appointed us mods, and we were looking for ideas we might have missed.We haven‚Äôt really thought about soliciting feedback again because we figured after the first post people would just message us directly. My life is built on the concept that the only thing that is certain is that certainty isn‚Äôt a thing.Because of this, I‚Äôm comfortable with risk (for better or worse) because I‚Äôve had to accept and surrender to that uncertainty or go insane.  It‚Äôs rather freeing.  Not sure if that makes sense.  Carbon based fuels have an extreme probability of dooming us all, renewables are unlikely to gain enough capacity in time.  Nuclear has a solution that is as safe or safer than air travel, can provide a stopgap and give the next generation a fighting chance.If it goes bad it‚Äôs is bad in a massive way true.  But as I understand it the US nuclear tech is actually designed in a manner where if failure occurs the meltdown kills itself vs becoming a self sustaining issue like Chernobyl. Support nuclear power and growth of thorium salt reactors would probably be the thing to focus on first.  Once renewables catch up then we can phase them out.  NASA put out a study that stated carbon producing fuel consumption is 15 times more responsible for death than nuclear.  Seems like its a great step to focus on nuclear power than pursue just green energy. With the inside being like it is, is it uncomfortable? > Stephen Crowder level of cringe for Trump Camp.I didn‚Äôt see that. Maybe I missed it. Seemed like he went after everyone pretty fairly.

I get your concern I‚Äôve mainly based my opinion on this article from the scientific journal ‚Äúnature‚Äù from 2010.https://www.nature.com/news/2010/100721/full/466432a.htmlGranted it‚Äôs a older study.  But these specific breed of mosquitoes aren‚Äôt that important for the ecosystem.The consequences of it would certainly be extreme.  Off the bat, one of most extreme I can think of is the lack of a vector for the disease could result in a population boom for unwanted creatures.  This would reduced food resources for more desirable creatures.  In fact, while I was joking only slightly the sources of the videos I linked too all suggest full eradication of every mosquito would be a really bad idea.  (A world without chocolate is not worth living) but Anopheles?  The current theory (from what I understand) is that there are enough other animals that would fill in the void.

We just made [this announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeFranco/comments/c6h7f5/on_biases_sourcing_and_discussing_the_argument/) two days ago!I really don‚Äôt want to nuke a thread, so I‚Äôm asking and pleading that y‚Äôall get along.Additionally there was two other posts today on this subject.  In an effort to cut down on spam they have been removed and can be found here:https://www.reddit.com/r/DeFranco/comments/c79ldg/journalist_andy_ngo_beaten_up_by_antifa_at/And this onehttps://www.reddit.com/r/DeFranco/comments/c7873r/antifa_face_off_against_proud_boys_at_pdx_airport/ Civility! please reword the post Apologies but someone else beat you too it so I‚Äôve had to remove this thread.  I‚Äôve linked this thread to that one.https://www.reddit.com/r/DeFranco/comments/c75iix/quartering_takes_a_dive/ There is was second post by u/johnny_pottseed. And now a third u/riptide747Found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/DeFranco/comments/c792x1/the_quartering/And here https://www.reddit.com/r/DeFranco/comments/c7k4kc/thoughts_on_these_accusations/As they are covering the exact same topic the post was removed to cut down on spam. Oh that post was removed it was a separate thread https://www.reddit.com/r/DeFranco/comments/c6h7f5/on_biases_sourcing_and_discussing_the_argument/ Mainly Civility rule violations, there was a few calling for violence.  (I ain‚Äôt about to let this sub get banned like T_D) Apologies as I realize I ignored your second point by accident.Phil does read and post on this sub.  He was on this sub this week actually defending his project Veritas video.  He generally only has time to read the comments.  Whenever he does post it hasn‚Äôt be met with a positive outcome on a sub that is supposed to be a subreddit made up of his fans.  He‚Äôs stated in the past that this is why he doesn‚Äôt post here often because it is very toxic towards him.  I‚Äôd love to make this sub feel more welcoming but it sadly still hasn‚Äôt happened.Regarding moderator biases, we acknowledge that the issue is complex.  All I can say regarding the matter is I take the situation extremely seriously and constantly question whether or not I‚Äôm doing something with biases and have often had to use structured analytical techniques and critical thinking practices to look at a situation.  Of course, there are times where it is impossible for me to look at a situation objectively.  Usually the barrier is if I find myself getting angry or worked up or emotional at a post.  It‚Äôs taken awhile, but I‚Äôve managed to train myself to recognize the situation where it‚Äôs happening.  That is normally where we‚Äôll come together as a mod team and see if they can weigh in on the best approach.  That however takes time and usually won‚Äôt result in an action until Phil and worm have had a chance to weigh in. (Longest that‚Äôs ever taken is two days).Regarding the ‚Äúfew users‚Äù comment well ... there are.  Out of 70,000 subscribers there‚Äôs going to be a few.  It‚Äôs a statistical probability that a few of them have got to not be on the level.  That said, it‚Äôs so small I generally consider them to be rare. So I actually meant ‚Äúfew‚Äù as is small case.  It doesn‚Äôt mean I think every person that gets a report on them is a troll.  That‚Äôs assuming guilt over innocence and that‚Äôs a very foreign concept to me. Yep.  Woke up and saw 8 reports on this guy.  Thank you for bringing to our attention.  That said, folks if you haven‚Äôt read the announcement thread at the top of the sub please do.  We‚Äôre trying to move the sub in a more civil direction when discussing content like this and can use some cooperation regarding the matter.  This is why some others had their posts removed or were given warnings. Keep it civil please.  Don‚Äôt attack the user.  If the post is using ‚Äúyou‚Äù a lot it‚Äôs probably an indicator that the discussion has shifted from the topic at hand to attacking the user.This is a warning to not escalate it further.Please see our announcement post for more informationEdit: Well... I warned them.  For those wondering yes this whole thread has been removed for a violation of the civility rule.  Neither of the parties involved were out to discuss the topic (despite claims otherwise) and were talking past each other.  Looking at what the other was saying only to come up with a counter argument.  That isn‚Äôt civility.Shame because to be honest it could have been a great discussion and they both were being up articles sources.  Just be more civil about it have respect for the other person you debating and don‚Äôt argue past one another. This is a warning to both you and u/SpectralReflection please keep the nature of you discussion civil.  No rules have been violated yet but this conversation seems like it‚Äôs headed that way from an outside observation.  Please see the announcement at the top of the sub for more information. One of the books I‚Äôve read on the subject described them something like this: ‚ÄúNormally a machine will not active try to kill you, a helicopter will, if given the chance to do so, in a malicious manner if not controlled properly. The constant adjustments to throttle, gain and the foot petals is as much an art form as it is a science.  Eventually, a pilot learns how to master it but it takes a lot of practice.‚ÄùI can‚Äôt remember which book it was, it‚Äôs a little hyperbole but the impact it leaves is a necessary evil for first time pilots. Nope, I understand how someone would think it‚Äôs multiple people but that ‚Äúapproved post‚Äù was meant as humor.  It‚Äôs just one person on this account... sadly Reddit is what I do...I don‚Äôt know how you get ‚Äú10 seconds apart‚Äù as I know I typed them up with a little more time in between than that well except for the ‚Äúapproved post‚Äù.  Remember once Reddit gets past a few hours it doesn‚Äôt really differentiate between minutes and that hour.The push for community standards is just in regards to the increasing polarization that‚Äôs it.  We noticed a trend and wanted to address it ahead of the election season kicking into full gear.  Reddit goes nuts politically speaking during this time and some serious trolls come out.  These are die hard zealots of their political movement who aren‚Äôt there to have a conversation but really just campaign for ‚Äútheir guy‚Äù.  They‚Äôll use a lot of dirty tactics too (that I‚Äôm not gonna get into as I don‚Äôt want to give anyone ideas), so we‚Äôre just trying to create that barrier while we can.  We love this sub and wanted to ensure that the trolls will have no grounds to feel welcomed while still keeping the core of the sub intact. There‚Äôs been several reports that say <no reason> in the past and they are literally someone reporting the thread because it discussed a political issue that is controversial.  It was obvious why and had nothing to do with the subs rules.  (It‚Äôs being used as an abuse of the reporting system).I can‚Äôt speak to your expectations or experience as a mod but I‚Äôve been a mod for three years now on several subs.  It‚Äôs true I can‚Äôt be on the sub 24/7.  But I know my abilities and limitations as a mod.  This is why it was stated that the <no reason> reports would be ignored.  We have rules in place and get enough reports without someone thinking that they can get someone removed or banned by ‚Äúgaming the system‚Äù.  You seem to have a beef against me for some reason.  So I‚Äôll be clear.  Phil selected me for this position because he felt that my dedication to the sub, ability to objectively look at situations, and willingness to seek involvement and innovation where practical would make me a good mod.  There‚Äôs no maliciousness here. No alternative motive.  I generally care about this sub and upholding the conversation. I like discussing news and hearing other opinions on the topic. I truly appreciate this. Approved It‚Äôs clearly satire and done in respect to Phil.Judges? Veterans are a protected class. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è [Should we eradicate mosquitoes?](https://youtu.be/e0NT9i4Qnak) Yes [yes we should.](https://youtu.be/oBzwQQSTxh0)[also Disney‚Äôs method of control are impressive](https://youtu.be/_30jPKzWdN0) r/ShitAntiVaxSays Youtube: hey welcome to this great place to host videos that could never appear on television like the wardrobe malfunction Youtube: ya know what you‚Äôve helped us grow our platform so much like a lot so we‚Äôre gonna give you some our our profits from the ad revenue Youtube: we are being bought out by google.

Take a fucking clue. Ah thanks I actually had to stop myself from responding ‚ÄúYWFMS‚Äù When someone stoped me in the parking lot to express their gratitude.Thankfully I just responded ‚Äúthank you‚Äù and moved on but it‚Äôs really weird the thought actually popped in my head at all.  Like what the hell is this sub doing to my brain? > common person to operate with minimal trainingHelicopters are unwieldy bastardsSource: working on helicopter license But who needs streets if we have VTOL in a ‚Äúpersonalized aircraft designed for a common person to operate with minimal training that can carry about the same number of people we would normally carry in a conventional ground vehicle also known as a car‚Äù. (Or ‚Äúflyingcar‚Äù if you will) I can‚Äôt help but wonder if we didn‚Äôt have roads do you think the need for [flying vehicles](https://youtu.be/riSS5Q1iIxc) would override current tech limitations?Think about how much money we could save on infrastructure by not having to build roads when we have [flying cars!](https://youtu.be/EX2S_wdUOZo) Wait how does it turn? Update on this.  I think we‚Äôve got a solution now.  (Managed to get a hold of a desktop today)I‚Äôve added a more descriptive explanation to the ‚Äúshort explanation‚Äù part of the rules.  It should be clearer now on mobile Hmmm. Now that‚Äôs an idea...  Maybe I can invite some moderate conservatives (guys from r/Tuesday... they‚Äôre like r/moderatepoltics if it leaned right) and some folks from r/centrist to help balance out things.  Most of them loathe trump and are capable of decent debate.I‚Äôm not sold on the idea though because * that doesn‚Äôt seem fair to the left. * I‚Äôm not sure of what the r/tuesday sub equivalent is for the left.* I‚Äôd rather changes happen organically in the sub and this announcement is pretty far from that concept as it is.* and inviting that level of interest could make things worse due to the [storming sessions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development) that would follow. My reading of your comment made it seem that it was just conservatives that were causing the cycle.  I apologize if that wasn‚Äôt what you intended.  I used a specific example because again it seemed like you were ignoring the lefts role.  Again I apologize if that‚Äôs not what you meant.  I do agree with it being a cycle and think you make an interesting point! Ordinarily that pattern keeps! but as I stated in the announcement the concern is that it will get more drastic as the election cycle heats up. The entirety of your original comment was calling out conservatives and didn‚Äôt mention the left at all.  I wanted to point out it‚Äôs an issue on both sides and wanted to express that this isn‚Äôt a push to take one side off the sub but to try and point out either side is at issue.  I mentioned both conservatives and liberals in my post in an effort to be bipartisan so I don‚Äôt get this comment>Wow, where‚Äôs that call for bipartisanship in the sub man? Who knows maybe the father wants the kidü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Isn‚Äôt that organ harvesting by a different name? Very interesting read.  I know the article states Dems need four seats.  I just don‚Äôt buy it‚Äôs something that Republicans shouldn‚Äôt worry.It was refreshing to hear someone actually say ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt the most important election of all time‚Äù though so definitely a good quick read! It‚Äôs certainly not just conservatives flooding. It is both sides and that‚Äôs the point. Yes, Reddit tends to lean left however this sub has always been unique in that left or right ideas are not downvoted simply because they came from conservatives or liberal perspectives. That‚Äôs not the case as of late. Currently, even Phil gets downvoted for expressing an opinion that deviates from the lefts stance on matters. That‚Äôs a bit much...Point is I don‚Äôt want this to be looked at as ‚Äúthose damn conservatives are coming in an ruining the sub‚Äù Or ‚Äúthose damn liberals are coming in and ruining the sub‚Äù. I want it to be looked at as partisanship is ruining the sub. The typo is the joke.I honestly wish FSS would have these hours though.  Just not be closed for 1,000 years between the days. Man that would be awesome I wanted to address a specific point separately for better discussions.  (Thus the double post)> It's almost like there is a targeted effort to turn this sub into another echo chamber.There are a few users here I suspect would love to see this sub go more right and/or more left.  I am not convinced it‚Äôs a targeted effort but they certainly have similar beliefs about who‚Äôs opinion ‚Äúadds to the conversation more‚Äù.This is a big ask for many but when you see comments that seem to try to pull one way or the other that are like this, speak up and say ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt make sense.‚ÄùGroup think is something that can happen, even online, and sometimes, it just takes enough dissenting opinion and people playing devils advocate for folks to realize group think is happening and that they need to snap out of it.I mean even this post was down voted to 85%.  A call for civility and to be a little less partisan! There is definitely an element of malcontent there too. I‚Äôve also encountered it a few times lately.  Not sure how to combat it beyond upvoting things that I may not agree with but that still add to the conversation.  It‚Äôs certainly something I‚Äôd like to improve and I‚Äôm hoping that enforcing the civility rule further on a more regular basis will help. we‚Äôre only as good as the users that report the issues.  I can certainly see your point about the vagueness issue on mobile so when I get access to my laptop in a few weeks I‚Äôll work on fixing it.  (Fixing it on mobile is hella hard)That said, it is in reddiquette that users of a sub must read and be familiar with the rules of a sub, so while I do see it as a issue that can be addressed and improved, it won‚Äôt be considered ‚Äúan excuse‚Äù.  Additionally, unfortunately, I can‚Äôt make it a major priority at the moment due to personal reasons. This is a warning to both you and u/Selethorme please keep the conversation civil.  You both haven‚Äôt violated the rules yet but this convo is headed that way quick.  Please see our announcement at the top of the sub for further clarification. So on the side bar we elaborate a little more what each of those rules are and what we mean by them.  But they are intentionally as few rules as we thought we could get by with as we really don‚Äôt enjoy limiting the conversation.As I know the pain of getting a side bar to show up on Mobile all to well (I primarily mod from the .compact extension)Here are the rules:Don't be a Douchebag of the Day	We understand that the topics Phil covers can be controversial and people with all kinds of different viewpoints participate on this sub, We want to make it clear that attacking others will not be tolerated. If you find yourself in an argument with someone else, follow this rule, "discuss the argument, and do not attack the person."No trolling	If the Mod team believes you are trolling you will be banned. It's like porn we know it when we see it.Criticism is allowed	We allow criticism of Phil and the PDS but try to make it productive criticism. If you are going to offer criticism, it needs to be constructive, solution oriented, and respectful. Try to see it from all sides, this will save everyone time and more than likely actually get positive responses from everyone involved. Slinging what amounts to hate will be a bannable offense. If you're complaining because "Phil didn't cover [x]" or we feel you are literally just trying to stir up shit for no reason other to make Phil look bad, this rule is for you.What specifically would you like to elaborate further on? Do you feel there should be another rule? I know it‚Äôs been several hundred years at least Yeah that‚Äôs never made sense to me So there was a base change of command and the army participated. It was 90 degrees out and in the prebriefs and practices we were told to eat breakfast, drink water and get sleep.30 minutes prior, the participants were in an air conditioned area with snacks provided, just Incase someone wasn‚Äôt able to eat breakfast. Despite being asked to bring their folks inside, the army leadership insisted that their ‚Äújoes‚Äù remain outside, in formation, and wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to have the snacks (because they didn‚Äôt even tell them about them).  Meanwhile their leaders remained in the Air conditioning.  When told they could loose two columns from their formation and use those extra ‚ÄúJoes‚Äù to fill in the ones that fallout, the Sergeant major gave the SMSgt a very perplexed look and said loud enough for his and two formations other around him to hear, ‚Äúno one will fall out! Got it!?‚Äù Of course his formation respond ‚ÄúNo Sergeant‚ÄùWhy does the Army hate its people and intentionally make it hard on their folks when they don‚Äôt need to?Even the Marines and the Navy took advantage of the AC, snacks and water.And yes there were at least three soldiers that fell out during the ceremony (one fell hard).

I‚Äôve actually referred people to that site in the past and had forgotten which one it was.  Thank you! Because politics, there are few things that cause people to loose reason than the tribal nature of right vs left and left vs right.  It‚Äôs not something I take personally so it‚Äôs fine. Please avoid attacking the user when discussing arguments.  For this reason your comment has been removed.  Continued actions in this manner will result in a ban.  (Please see our recent announcement) There is some hope on that fronthttps://www.technologyreview.com/s/612357/deepfake-busting-apps-can-spot-even-a-single-pixel-out-of-place Phil I‚Äôm glad you covered it.  I think your team did a great job and y‚Äôall did your research this is the kind of stuff I‚Äôve been waiting for all week.Something to add to the discussion.  Didn‚Äôt Facebook recently get in hot water for the way it treats the folks that moderate its content?  What is interesting about that is it came out that Facebook outsources this function to contractors that ‚Äúare not Facebook employees‚Äù.  I wonder if google uses a similar process where it‚Äôs not google employees that are doing it but sub contractors instead. Man I‚Äôd go bananas if that were true As luck would have it I may be moving there soon. This is why I come here thank you for the explanation. [I'm just gonna leave this here](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/c611ly/how_i_like_to_imagine_reddit_bans_go_down/) I mean if curiosity kills the cat what does that do to a monkey?(And with that I know why I am going to hell) Alright quit monkeying around and get back to work. That‚Äôs the Secret Empire storyline.  Great series with pretty interesting take on how people with render freedom for security in the name of ‚Äúmaintaining their way of life‚Äù.Spoilers for those that haven‚Äôt read it:  Cap‚Äôs powers were returned via a cosmic cube by redskull shinagins.  Except when he gave cap back his powers skull also changed history so that cap was a hydra agent all along.  The whole thing ends with ‚Äúoriginal memory cap‚Äù and ‚Äúhydra cap‚Äù fighting.  Comic books explained channel does a great breakdown of it and helps it make sense.  I would love to see this be phase 4 of the MCU. Well unless you don‚Äôt count secret empire... So... r/politics is up next on the chopping block? At least we got past 20 now.... (yeah that didn‚Äôt help me either)I was able to improve my board score this year but I would have still needed a 93 on the test. [Yeah about that](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/bp5xiv/the_adventures_of_tsgt_bahl_the_glass_ceiling/) > He's the opposite of a RiNO, and he knows it. He's a Conservative-in-all-but-nameThat‚Äôs called a DINOI thought they were extinct Yeah.. I don‚Äôt get it either. Honestly I wish they had kept after the trump going.  That shit was great. Usually that‚Äôs how we roll here too but I just couldn‚Äôt let that stand You had something the others didn‚Äôt.  Can you guess? Radical seems about right Fringe implies that Bernie‚Äôs movement is small. But I concede the point.On the matter of trump.  I absolutely think his constant coverage was the issue.  The news (being unaware of how social media works) I guess never learned the lesson about feeding attention to the troll.  If they had down played him and focused on more serious legitimate candidates I think Kasich or Cruz would have been in office right now.  (Kasich I‚Äôd be happy about, Cruz less so but still alright) sadly there no real point in dwelling on what might of been.... but I can get the popcorn and watch the Democratic candidates destroy themselves like the Republican Party did last season.Bernie gonna be a wrecking ball Yeah but you get that [sweet super power](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/9n3au3/more_than_a_pay_raise/) Because football is a thing.Though oddly the powderpuff league thing is also gaining more steam than the NFL soo...  maybe ... girls rock? Also to add to what u/ZiggoCiP wrote, it very nearly came down to a tie if not for a PK. Ya know if youtube would branch out to other advertisers they could make a killing.  Gun makers and the like would probably love to advertise on the more conservative channels.I mean google invented targeted advertising, I‚Äôm certain that would be a better solution than worrying about controversial Youtubers being supported by brands that want nothing to do with them. Holly shit. For some reason that didn‚Äôt show up in my feed.  Just a moment. Seems about right.  The only democratic candidates I‚Äôm familiar with are the ‚Äúextreme examples‚Äù that the right has turned into a meme by this point:Comrade BernieHandsy-Mcgaffe Bidden But the ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù Dems are something of a mystery.  I was gonna wait until the debates to get measure of who I should look more into.  Off the bat though I am aware of how they‚Äôre ranked from [‚Äúmost socialist to lesser‚Äù](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/here-are-the-most-socialisticand-most-capitalistic-democrats-running-for-president-190000240.html)That said.  Fans of the kasichforpresident sub are painfully aware how nonextreme candidates get sidelined by the press for clickbait headlines.I actually see this election season as a test for the ‚Äúmain stream media‚Äù.  They know if they can highlight a moderate over someone on an extreme end of the spectrum they [can very likely get enough moderate Republicans](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/is-trump-making-the-democrats-moderate-again?_amp=true) to vote dem this season, but it will come at the expense of their ratings and clicks because... star power.If the news focuses on click bait, however, you can expect them to focus on Sanders and Bidden and the election season will likely play out exactly like the last one.This may be a reason that Fox won‚Äôt discuss the moderate candidate.  MSNBC likely wants more socialism and CNN would likely want Bidden like they did Hillary last year. The irony is this is the point where I paused it to actually read what he was covering and what was in the description and it was just too perfect to not share.The climate change vote and the almost going to war with Iran were the ones that made me make that same face. 3 D battleship 2013?  And has line for MSgt?<Sighs in 14 year TSgt>I mean good on em! Ah just in time for the elections... As a conservative, I‚Äôve said numerous time in the past that the T_D is cancer. The problem with this is now what is said and done is even less ‚Äúin the eye of the public‚Äù.  That said, does that mean other subs can be held to the same standard?  ^(Looking at you chapotraphouse) Free speech however ‚Äúcall to actions that are illegal‚Äù are a fine restriction.(For instance saying you should milkshake someone, which is assault is illegal)I‚Äôm allowed to be offended. The government is not allowed to censor that which offends me.  My opinion is like everyone else‚Äôs... it stinks like a fart.  And just like a fart when it‚Äôs out there I can‚Äôt complain when someone smells it and holds their nose and complain.  Meaning everyone is allowed to rebuttal my opinion.I don‚Äôt get why you think conservatives say ‚Äúonly their opinion‚Äù.  One of the catch lines I‚Äôve heard said from conservatives is ‚ÄúI may disagree with your opinion, but I‚Äôll fight to let you have one‚Äù [accompanied by a meme like this](https://i.imgur.com/1UDNf.jpg)That said, I am certain there are those on the right that do think only their opinion matters but my experience has been it‚Äôs more on the left that worries about the impact that having free speech brings.  This is purely anecdotal though so take that for what it‚Äôs worth (next to nothing) 60 round a minute?  So spay a pray? Seems like a waste of ammo. So like all the way to WMDs?  Or just short of that? Wow how .... Scandalous Was really hoping that he would have talked about this.It‚Äôs this really interesting situation because on one hand the republicans are basically unable to influence the outcome and they are literally doing the only thing they can do to oppose it. The local population actually voted against the measure and the Democrats are still wanting to pushing through.  And on the other hand there is a legitimate reasoning and call for the Republicans to DO YOUR FUCKING job and not resort to the same cheap tactics that Dems resorted to in the past. So long I tried to make that happen (wrath kept taking too much damage).  I think I spent a day or so Three sir Gifs that end too soon This article seems to speak directly to the concept of [thought germs](https://youtu.be/rE3j_RHkqJc)As most have already seen that video there is another video and how it applies to politics directly from [a different channel](https://youtu.be/-UiHzHQW0vc) > AF doesn't think the same.No we don‚Äôt and I‚Äôm glad we don‚Äôt.We‚Äôd rather just make it so no one sleeps in the dirt. While the issue of sexual immorality in church leaders is an issue that truly has harmed the church, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the thing we should be focusing on as Christians.  Helping the poor, and being examples of hope, joy, love and compassion... selfless service that I think would do more help for the image of the church than focusing on ‚Äúexpelling the sinner‚Äù.  (Which by the way I disagree strongly with applying Paul‚Äôs writing on this matter to the church as a whole... as it directly contradicts Jesus‚Äôs example of befriending the sinner‚Äù)Imagine if as morally sound Christians we didn‚Äôt lie at work about taking that extra long break, if someone complained about a problem with their home that they were trying to fix, that we helped them without a second thought to ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs in it for me?‚Äù.This, I think, would do far more to ‚Äúmaintain the promise of virtue‚Äù than expelling the sinner.That said, churches do need to take seriously the protection of vulnerable individuals.  The Boy Scouts for example: almost ten years ago, the Boy Scouts made a concerted effort to improve their training and rules and are now the ‚Äúgold standard among the youth agencies for both anti bullying and youth protection programs‚Äù accounting to the CDC.If that organization can do it, so can the church.  These predators are looking to find easy victims.  If your church takes ‚Äúyouth protection‚Äù seriously it can easily implement proven safety protocols and practices that prevents/decrease the abuses cycle in metered ways.Also, because I want to make sure I‚Äôm clear on the subject.  Just because I‚Äôm against ‚Äúfocusing on expelling the sinner‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean that we should protect them either.  If they‚Äôve prayed on someone in the church, offer them up on a silver platter to the police.  Support them emotionally and be sure to support their family as well, but if they do the crime it‚Äôs their ass. Im not crying... shut up! you‚Äôre crying!  These are just sweat from... my eyeballs! I think he cares as much about it as AOC.  As he mentioned it was a plank in his campaign platform.  From the video I believe his intentions are earnest > unaccountable power.Very good point.  But I think the intent there is that they don‚Äôt try to stay in office but actually try and pass legislation even [if it‚Äôs unpopular.](https://youtu.be/gQcRibGhhSg)How about something like this...  They get two terms, but on the third year of their second term a straight yes or no vote is done to see if the electorate wants the senator to stay in office.  If they do they get the rest of the term.  If not a special run off election is held for the last two years that won‚Äôt count towards the ‚Äúnew senator‚Äôs‚Äù term limit.This still allows for term limits but prevents the lame duck session until the last two years of the second term.That said, I think senators have a better incumbent advantage then reps.  Mainly due to the name recognition factor. [You're not wrong it‚Äôs just](https://youtu.be/x50hwBCGH6M) Absolutely a good idea.  I‚Äôm sure there is a way to make a compromise or allowance for such things.  Another thing that would have to be considered is the whistle blower protections afforded to Federal employees when discussing with congress members.  The military specifically has regulations in place that add privacy assurances to prevent reprisals for alerting congress members to fraud waste and abuse occurrence. Oooo That‚Äôs a good one!  I‚Äôm inclined to like it but to play devils advocate (because I want to really flesh out this concept), do you think corporations would be less inclined to share proprietary information with regulators then? Or a statue of satan I‚Äôm definitely for senators getting 2x6 year terms.  Not sure how I feel about 3x2 year terms for the house though seems like it could be 4 or 5.The lobbyist issue has always been complex.  On one hand who would know better than a congressmember on how to navigate legislative hurdles?  It‚Äôs a skill I‚Äôm sure many lobbyist value and need; but on the other hand the amount of influence a lobbyist can hold by promising a cushy job for votes in favor of their cause is such an open secret it‚Äôs an accepted part of society!On thing is for certain I think if you‚Äôre going to have term limits then the restrictions of lobbyist MUST also happen or we will end up with a massive revolving door it will only make matters worse.

Namely it effectively prevents troll control. So looking past the biases and opinions of the author and getting down to facts presented.  Let‚Äôs breakdown some of this in context.In the wake of what‚Äôs happened with Steven Crowder and other conservatives on YouTube, it comes down to is Youtube a publisher or a platform?  Platforms are supposed to be information neutral and only screening out ‚Äúillegal content‚Äù.  Meaning infringement on someone‚Äôs ability to say their opinion would be grounds for a 1st amendment considerations, provided it‚Äôs not child porn, a call to action against a protected status (Veterans, race, sex, etc). In the physical world, this is akin to being allowed to protest but only in ‚Äúdesignated areas‚Äù.Publishers can be held liable for the things their authors say meaning the crackpot claims of Vox and Praguer U can get Youtube in trouble.  In the physical word, this is why newspapers can be held liable for saying false things that damage someone‚Äôs character.  Side note: Youtube claims they need to censor their ‚Äúcontroversial and contentious user‚Äôs‚Äù because it effects their advertisers, so that would be a interesting challenge.This is all extremely over simplified and there are a lot of nuances to the concept and laws that I only can begin to barely understand.Sen Hawley seems to be under the impression that Youtube is a combination of these two and able to pick and chooseI think this bill is a direct result of a movement to censor conservatism from social media by Silicon Valley companies, and a extremely tech savvy vocal minority.  As these companies are basically de facto monopolies (because we‚Äôve allowed to get that way through mergers, and anti competitive business practices) these companies are in a position to virtually control the political narrative in a substantial way.   This bill seem to hope to ensure that those companies can continue to be monopolies so long as they are in effect a ‚Äúregulated utility‚Äù meaning they‚Äôre ‚Äúinformation neutral‚Äù.  The problem?  Well.. information neutral didn‚Äôt work out so well in radio.  It basically meant the conservative shows had to display liberal counter arguments and the liberals would just ignore it!  I can easily see the same thing happening again.Honestly, I think a better solution would be to simply not allow monopolies in the social media industries in the first place, but we know that won‚Äôt happen! Is it a budget if it doesn‚Äôt last longer than one congress? Got the vid link? There‚Äôs a difference between forcing someone to display a ‚Äúfreedom of expression‚Äù that they don‚Äôt agree with censoring someone because you don‚Äôt agree with them.  The baker was asked and said ‚Äúno‚Äù, the baker refused a contract.  The gay couple then turned around and demanded that the court make the baker say ‚Äúyes.‚Äù  This means the baker was denied their ‚Äúright to be offended‚Äù and was instead forced to ‚Äúshut up and color‚Äù or ‚Äúnot be offended‚Äù so the gay couple ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt be offended‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs disappointing I don‚Äôt empathize with that position.‚Äù > As someone from the very far left, I personally am looking for something that might enshrine a protection from removal any true information... that might yet be extremely controversialAs the Crowder instance has shown recently, usually the best action is to honestly ignore the ‚Äúoffended‚Äù person.  Otherwise you draw way more attention to the situation than is warranted.  The old adage is very true: ‚Äúdon‚Äôt feed the trolls‚Äù.  [I very much believe in this meme](https://i.redd.it/izudcysa64531.jpg) when it comes to dealing with the concept of free speech.  As long as no one is making a ‚Äúcall to action against a protected status‚Äù or violating the subs rules then after that I leave to the nation to ignore or highlight as they deem fit.Me policing the ‚Äúcontent‚Äù of the sub effectively ends this sub being a sub for ‚ÄúPhil and his fandom‚Äù and instead becomes a sub for ‚Äúmy opinions‚Äù. Which isn‚Äôt my goal here (that‚Äôs what r/hindsightin2020 is for)So no I‚Äôm not going to intervene on controversial topics unless they violate the rules, but I‚Äôd do that anyway if it wasn‚Äôt.  That said, I‚Äôm still going to share my opinion but just because I disagree doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôd ban or sensor that person.  That goes against my own ideological/value system. Yes.

[Just gonna leave this here](https://youtu.be/OpW3cWTGIOE) A lot of it has to do with the [ad hominem fallacies](https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/wi-phi/wiphi-critical-thinking/wiphi-fallacies/v/ad-hominem).It‚Äôs actually really easy to separate the person from the topic.  If the term ‚Äúyou‚Äù is in the sentence is usually the he first indicator.  Now, in practice is where it gets difficult.  But normally after a warning most people get it.  It‚Äôs about respecting the person and understanding that while you may disagree with their opinion.  They‚Äôre still a person a human, with desires, families, loved ones, etc.  it doesn‚Äôt make that person‚Äôs any less valued than yours in terms of free speech.  It‚Äôs hard in practice, real hard.  But it‚Äôs something I believe in and something Phil believes, the concept of free speech.  He hasn‚Äôt talked about it in a while, but in the older shows he‚Äôs displayed very strong opinions on the matter.  I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôve mellowed as he ages but i can tell that spark is still there every time he talks about ‚Äúmain stream media‚Äù vs ‚Äúthe yourtuber.‚Äù It‚Äôs why we have the ‚Äúdiscuss the topic, don‚Äôt attack the user‚Äù rule. Beyond that Phil has a tendency to attract moderates and those who do their own research.  Normally if people start violating that rule we‚Äôll look at their post history in the sub and look to see if they have a pattern of violating that rule.  If there‚Äôs several instances we‚Äôll either warn, remove and or ban considering the circumstances.  I‚Äôve banned both hard line trump supporters, far left socialists, and even the occasional ‚Äúcentrist‚Äù who wouldn‚Äôt listen to anyone with an opinion that wasn‚Äôt theirs.  It usually is messy with hurt feelings all around, because we typically let it get too far and too visible, but considering the alternative is one of the ‚Äúideologically pure subs‚Äù (one of which I moderate, sadly... not my choice) Had no intention of changing that anytime soon, so no worries there. Oh I had no intention of taking it down (with the exception of the Phil rule we try to keep things as laissez faire as possible) especially since the top comment is yours questioning the validity of the story.I know there‚Äôs some dedicated hobbyist fact checkers on this sub that will probably rip it apart if their interests is peaked enough. You‚Äôd be surprised, there are occasions where this kinda stuff makes it past the folks that sort by new but usually someone sees word press and it‚Äôs instantly down voted.

Someone really believes in it and wants to push it.I first saw it on r/intelligencenews and that sub rarely gets more than a few votes on anything.Also, this makes no sense, the FBI‚Äôs mission prevents them from messing with stuff overseas that‚Äôs the CIA or NSA.

Came here to ask this same question. Our dog looks like this.Currently think she‚Äôs a Boykin spaniel Jokes on you I love Hawaii music Yeah blues Monday‚Äôs were a thing until mid 2009 I just never understood why they wear blues so often.  It‚Äôs the definition of a in-place deployed unit. And as I‚Äôve stated earlier there should be exceptions for rape, incest and physical health of the mother Well the moment of Conception is the benchmark for ultra conservatives, and at one point I did think that‚Äôs was clear metric. But then I looked in the science behind stem cells, the science behind how we classify life and distinguish it between animal, plant, and lower life forms.  These primarily influence my decisionBut the thing that got me to move on it was until the heartbeat is detected the chances of natural miscarriage due to genetic non viability are far higher than any other stage in pregnancy.I fully admit it‚Äôs grey and subjective (but that‚Äôs what being a centrist is about am I right?), but for me it‚Äôs what makes sense. I disagree on heartbeat being far too early.  For me it‚Äôs based on what from a scientific perspective is measurable life.Reason being movement is a criterium for animal life.  Heartbeat is that first measure of movement.  I understand the argument that ‚Äúpain‚Äù should be the measure but pain is too subjective to be a measurable data point.  Heartbeat is very clear sign that what is there is without question ‚Äúalive‚Äù. Now whether it‚Äôs ‚Äúa person‚Äù is a bit to philosophical for me.I do agree however that ‚Äúright to life‚Äù does progress as the group of as cells mature.   As the guy from [legal eagle youtube](https://youtu.be/eUQXo1N-OA8) channel explained.  I simply disagree where that line should be, as it should be based on a scientifically and easily measured metric.  Heart beat meets that criteria for me. If that‚Äôs the case then that has been the second argument that I can say would sway me from my position.  But only because I feel that a heartbeat law is only viable where contraception is readily available.  What parts make it unavailing to them?If they‚Äôre going to pursue that law than contraception must be extremely available.The other is if it‚Äôs a minor become pregnant.  I have zero sympathy for an adult making an irresponsible decision but a minor?

This is why I deal in chances and probabilities. > highest teen pregnancy rates are places in the south where things like Abstinence only is taught and contraception isn't as easily available.Looking past that contraception is free.

My biscuits are chard black now Yes that is a far right position.And the far left is that abortion should be legal in all circumstances and under any condition.Anything that is in the middle of that would be a centrist position.> No compassion for the poorAbsolutely not, that‚Äôs why I listed where someone can get FREE contraception and the sources are numerous.What I‚Äôm against is people thinking that a life can be thrown away simply because they‚Äôre too dumb to understand that sex leads to kids unless you take precautions.> massive government bailouts of all of the unwed childrenThat‚Äôs a slippery slope argument.that requires several supporting factors to occur.* lack of access to FREE contraception  (sake of argument 10% chance)* [contraception fails 20%](https://americanpregnancy.org/preventing-pregnancy/birth-control-failure/)* adoption doesn‚Äôt go through 33%. * the glut of unwilling parents triggers an economic crisis that merits such a bailout (chances very but going on today‚Äôs congress I‚Äôd give it 15% -30% chance of passing) In reverse, the argument means that just because you‚Äôre stupid means that a human life is killed?  In the context of nialism and humanism sure that makes since but I put more value in the potential of human life than that.This ‚Äúwell they‚Äôre poor so adding kids to the equation just makes it worse‚Äù is literally the same as Scrooge‚Äôs famous line.  ‚ÄúBetter then for them to die and decrease the surplus population!‚Äù Hopefully that‚Äôs what these bills are the start of Stargate SG1 is now available on amazon prime.

Plan B is sold in nearly every Walmart in the country.  I agree it‚Äôs not super convenient but I‚Äôm not convinced that it‚Äôs as big of a problem as it‚Äôs made out to be. So does that mean the Vox guy could learn a lesson? No, a right wing position would be no abortion at all under any circumstances.  I think the heartbeat is a great compromise.  It still allows for abortions, it just also requires a little responsibility of an adult who has unprotected sex.  And as I mentioned, I think exceptions must be allowed for rape, incest and physical health of the mother.

It‚Äôs not like there is literally thousands of years of philosophy questioning the existence of man or anything?All that said, with the exception of rape, incest, physical health of the mother, IMO, heartbeat seems like a solid barrier in a modern world where contraception and plan B is so readily available.  Otherwise, there is adoption.  Your dumb adult ass not taking responsibility for your dumb adult actions does not mean an innocent human life should be eliminated.

However what I think happens is companies don‚Äôt want that liability so they let the government over regulate them and become a ‚Äú[regulated utility](https://nuclear.duke-energy.com/2017/06/09/regulated-versus-deregulated-what-you-should-know)‚Äù (a government sanctioned monopoly).  This means that they have no drive or desire to innovate because the barrier for entry of a new competitor is so astronomical simply because you basically need a full scale operational reactor to even meet safety standards.  The build small, build slowly, build as you go, model that other tech industry exploit and enjoy doesn‚Äôt work as a result.Again! There absolutely must be safety inspection, and there absolutely needs to be restrictions in place on the safe handling of nuclear materials/waste and byproducts, but as it is now you can‚Äôt even dispose of nuclear waste properly because [there are so few ‚Äúapproved‚Äù locations.](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/nuclear-waste/storage-and-disposal-of-radioactive-waste.aspx) https://www.technologyreview.com/s/512321/safer-nuclear-power-at-half-the-price/> Bringing the new reactor to market will be challenging. Although the basic idea of a molten-salt reactor has been demonstrated, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission‚Äôs certification process is set up around light-water reactors. The company will need the NRC to establish new regulations, especially since the commission must sign off on the idea of using less steel and concrete if the design‚Äôs safety features are to lead to real savings.The fact that the NRC restraints on nuclear energy are so complete that companies aren‚Äôt able to innovate in a proven safer technology shows there‚Äôs signs that the regulations are too strict, IMO. I get it but you‚Äôre not getting me, the term tax increase is where you will loose most GOP support.  It doesn‚Äôt matter what study you cite, what methodology you use.

Sometimes it‚Äôs just a matter of terminology and education **Toxic leadership** - fuck heads that believe that as long as they look good and/or can make your life or someone else‚Äôs worse they‚Äôve done their job.  0.09% of the leadership you‚Äôll encounter. (Yes, I‚Äôve encountered these bastards. they exist and thankfully I managed to GTFO before things got real bad)**Idiot leadership** - incompetence or ego prevents them from accepting/seeing solutions that would still allow the unit to succeed in its assigned mission without causing undue stress on the people under their command.  EPRs are typically late as are decorations.  Quarterlies are usually given to those that have done the shiniest task not those that have busted their ass that whole quarter doing their actual job and somehow managing to do all that volunteer shit... (assuming if leadership even manage to successfully submit it by the deadline in the first place).  Mentorship/PME is as a foreign concept as teaching advanced physics to a freshmen liberal arts major.  25% of the leadership you‚Äôll encounter **Bad leadership** - they know they‚Äôre doing it wrong, it may be for the right reason but the message as to why, what their intentions were and for how long is so poorly communicated that it might as well be them actively trying to make your life miserable.  Packages make it to the correct parent organization 50% of the time.  They make attempts at mentorship but it isn‚Äôt well received because again... they suck at delivery and timing.  They think they have to innovate for the sake of innovation not because it‚Äôs necessary 25%**Avg Leadership** - they don‚Äôt cause problems, the squadron runs smooth, they‚Äôre not out to ‚Äúinnovate the unit to death‚Äù.  You aren‚Äôt going to get a stellar EPR or award period but you aren‚Äôt going to get screwed over either. 30%**Decent maybe even Good Leadership** - you have clear guidance, good directions.  There‚Äôs things you don‚Äôt like about your unit but you never have to wait for something to get signed, EPRs, decorations and quarterlies are submitted regularly without much issue.  You‚Äôre not sure if the commander knows your name or not but they‚Äôre friendly enough when you pass by them in the hall on their way to their 5th meeting of the day.  SNCOs make attempts at regular mentorship at all levels but their isn‚Äôt a real commitment to it. You get called in to do some dumb stuff from time to time but it‚Äôs pretty rare and you typically understand how and why it‚Äôs like that. 19%**Great leadership** - they don‚Äôt call you in when on shift work for any reason.  The end of the duty day is sacred.  PT is during duty hours.  Awards/decorations/performance reports are submitted on time because of a clear vision and direction from a charismatic and involved leader who knows the first names of nearly every NCO in their command.  They make decisions based on what is best for their unit not their careers.  And on a few occasions, have prevented bullshit taskers from ever reaching the ears/inboxes of a nardowell NCOs.  The 99.99% of the unit is without question able to do the job and is held accountable when a member has fallen through the cracks.  As a result, the unit member takes an active role in growing every new arrival until they function to the same excellent standard.  Weaknesses are found in everyone but through proper application of mentorship, guidance, training and education the unit is made strong.  The commander is regularly seen on days and night shift working with their folks.  Lays out dedicated times to mentor their CGO and SNCOs.  Their very being inspires pride in your work and your unit.

The risk I see with censoring access is that merely creating these filters allows authoritarians to use the blocklist for far more than just the intended porn sites.

Then we also saw a large blacklisting of pro-life and conservative websites that was rolled out in a [Conneticut](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/school-under-fire-for-blocking-conservative-and-pro-life-websites-including) school.I think that filters should be run locally rather than remote and centralized. e.g. if parents wish to monitor or block access to certain websites, that is their right to do so and own their own devices. However, we should not lobby for data censorship laws, as they will be abused given time. Teaching children how to use the internet, and teaching them morality and where it comes from, will do far more than a heavy handed filter. People, including myself, used to enjoy the challenge bypassing filters during school lunch breaks to play PopCap games. It is fairly easy to do to this day. If someone wants to see the trash on the internet, there are hundreds of ways to bypass the filter so that they still will.On the other hand, I don't agree with the Libertarians on Prostitution and Obscenity laws.

And in abortion, the statists have found a most effective method of obliterating freedom: obliterating the individual. Abortion on demand is the ultimate State tyranny; the State simply declares that certain classes of human beings are not persons, and therefore not entitled to the protection of the law. The State protects the "right" of some people to kill others, just as the courts protected the "property rights" of slave masters in their slaves. Moreover, by this method the State achieves a goal common to all totalitarian regimes: it sets us against each other, so that our energies are spent in the struggle between State-created classes, rather than in freeing all individuals from the State. Unlike Nazi Germany, which forcibly sent millions to the gas chambers (as well as forcing abortion and sterilization upon many more), the new regime has enlisted the assistance of millions of people to act as its agents in carrying out a program of mass murder. - [Being Pro-Life Is Necessary to Defend Liberty](http://www.l4l.org/library/bepro-rp.html) It's known that [Democrats Fund Libertarian Spoilers](https://spectator.org/democrats-fund-libertarian-spoilers/), and some of their party is [pro-abortion](http://pro-choicelibertarians.net/) and [anti-voluntarism](https://fee.org/articles/must-a-jewish-baker-make-a-nazi-cake/).However, there is another sect that is [pro-life](http://www.l4l.org/) and [voluntary](https://www.newsweek.com/must-jew-bake-cake-nazi-same-sex-marriage-lakewood-mullins-craig-447427).

However, this is still great news! Hopefully more states follow suite. Cronyism usually involves pay-to-play schemes, tax exemptions for the rich, personal favours, and bailouts. Socialistic, in my definition, includes higher taxes to pay for perceived and unperceived inequalities. Trump assumes Amazon is giving us an unlevel playing field, yet is imposing an across the board tax increase for online sellers. If he decides to exempt his own companies from his proposed tax increases, that would be purely crony capitalism for his own self-interest. socialistic =/= socialism. I also agree that it is crony-capitalism. Milton was a believer in open and free markets, Trump is not giving us that. To be fair, some of what Trump is doing is socialistic - e.g. going after Amazon by imposing a large Internet Tax on small businesses and imposing heavy tariffs / trade war.

How do we get conservatives to care about the primaries.Getting them (re-)motivated is a tough one, and I'm not sure.As for the second part, we have to show them that elections have consequences. One of the best ways to do that is match their voting record from the legislative season to the election season. This is becoming more difficult due to campaign laws which prohibit such activity...However, by reminding the voter of the incumbent's bad record, there's a good chance they will not vote for them again. Especially on hot-topic single issues, if the messaging is done right.The book *Confrontational politics* by H. L Richardson explains this tactic well for gun rights, where he held the line in deep blue California for many years. He also encouraged physical rallies and *confrontations* to let the conservative presence be known at Town Halls, etc. [Indivisible has since credited the TeaParty for this tactic](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-indivisible-protests-trump-congress-20170206-story.html) which they are actively using against Republicans nationwide. [NARAL](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/362633-abortion-rights-group-launches-first-salvo-against-illinois-dem) does the same thing for abortion rights. The problem with reactionary movements is that they occur spontaneously and burn out just as quickly. [The Tea Party](https://mises.org/wire/tea-party-over) was a knee-jerk reaction to Obama and taxation, whereas the alt-right formed around Trump being political incorrect. While both movements played an interesting part and did awaken people to issues, the active rallies have mostly died out. To some degree both movements left their followers feeling betrayed. The alt-right assumed Trump would be the ultimate outsider to ["build the wall"](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/28/3-d-chess-looks-like-trump-throwing-away-presidency/), and the Tea Party expected leaders like Paul Ryan to hold the line, instead he [betrayed them openly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/02/03/paul-ryan-to-tea-party-you-are-the-problem/).

I am definitely seeing this on a much bigger scale than even the last election cycle (and last cycle was pretty fun, got verbally assaulted just for doing a door to door literature drop). They see Republicans/Conservatives as the complete enemy of progressiveism, and unlike us - there is no compromise on their goals. This all or nothing mentality of Saul Alinsky politics is making it more difficult to peacefully discuss issues without being brigaded with logical fallacies intent on shutting you down. Sometimes they will attack you even on things in which we may agree.> This is bigotry.

I've been monitoring the alternatives/competitors pretty closely, and hoping for a break out due to the ongoing censorship, but it's a bit of a [dumpster fire](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/05/590919849/a-phrase-for-our-time-merriam-webster-adds-dumpster-fire-to-dictionary) in terms of usability, and overall goals.* First, we had [Andrew Torba](https://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/265292/andrew-torba-talks-fighting-internet-censorship-frontpagemagcom), one of the conservative pioneers in the alternate social media movement, explain how bad Twitter was. He went on to create Gab.ai, which is a neat site, but still we are at the mercy of a centralized gate keeper, e.g. Mr. Torba, since it's not [federated](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/03/introduction-distributed-social-network) or [decentralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_computing). * Voat.co would be another example of a centralized alternative. * While these traditional-style networks do provide temporary freedom, I seriously suspect that they will be required by law to remove content due to the passing of [SESTA](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/how-congress-censored-internet) and [CLOUD](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/responsibility-deflected-cloud-act-passes) acts. SESTA in particular holds *the website owner responsible for the content of it's users*. So if someone posts controversial items on your website, it is *you* who can get the blame, not the user. This is backwards from how the internet previously worked, and puts you at the mercy of trolls.* Other semi-centralized networks include [Friendica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendica), which emerged as more or less a "bridge" network, with the idea that you can posting to your existing social media while using it. This gives people no real incentive to [#DeleteFacebook](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/20/17142806/how-to-delete-facebook-page-account-data-privacy), so not that many people use it. * Disaspora is another project that is somewhat similar, people claim, to Facebook, and was started on KickStarter to implement the first federated social network similar to Facebook. It seems to be pretty dead, but I'm not sure and never investigated further.* [Mastadon](https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/7/15183128/mastodon-open-source-twitter-clone-how-to-use) emerged as the left's federated "Twitter alternative" service, and does seem like the technology is worth while. Anyone can start their own "Mastadon instance" on their own computer or web server, and it will communicate with all other Mastadon servers, however you only host what is on your instance. If you join someone's instance and they are liberals, you could still get censored, but you reserve the right to move your data to whatever instance you wish.* [Twister](http://twister.net.co/) could be considered one of the first purely p2p social networks, but it didn't scale too well and never really took off. I'm unsure if it is still being developed.* [ZeroNet/ZeroMe](https://bluishcoder.co.nz/2017/10/12/zerome-decentralized-microblogging-on-zeronet.html) emerged as an alternative to both models. It uses peer-to-peer to be fully decentralized, so anyone with a phone or computer who runs the software can help grow the overall the network. However, it provides content control. The original "site creator" and it's users are able to "unpin" any content that they do not wish to host. Users can very easily "clone" existing sites, which allows for quickly created alternatives if a site creator does start censoring. I would say this is a mix of the federation and decentralized model. This network also allows users to host videos, but your computer or device would need to remain online to ensure healthy "seeding" (as does the underlying protocol, Bittorrent)* A parallel movement is attempting to put all discussion on the BlockChain, along with health records and other sensitive data. I tend to agree with [Snowden](https://news.bitcoin.com/snowden-on-bitcoin-blasts-public-ledger-and-core-developers/) that that's a horrible idea. The BlockChain is a permanent record, so editing and deleting any previous comments will not be possible.* Discussion takes place primarily on the r/OffTube and r/DeGoogle subs whenever a new tech alternative pops up.  In summary, Mastadon scaled pretty quickly as a Twitter alternative after people on the right and left were getting banned. However, I've yet to see any network that has really taken off as did Facebook/YouTube. I suppose only time will tell. Hopefully we will have enough time to decide before the day of reckoning comes and some future dictator or ill informed congressman bans free speech on the Internet. > most local police would refuse orders to confiscate guns.[Yes](https://www.oathkeepers.org/declaration-of-orders-we-will-not-obey/), thankfully. > The beauty about the internet is that you can go to a different site.Yep, unfortunately no one will find it since Google also is censoring the alternatives.So learn how to go r/OffTube and r/DeGoogle as they say. It would have to be up to the citizens of the UK, not foreign nationals. However, the natural rights in the UK, being freedom of speech for one, has clearly eroded. Based on your previous statement, we should follow man's law over God's (natural) law. That was warned against by America's founding fathers as well as religious texts, e.g. Acts 5:29. > In short, it is the greatest absurdity to suppose it in the power of one, or any number of men, at the entering into society, to renounce their essential natural rights, or the means of preserving those rights; when **the grand end of civil government, from the very nature of its institution, is for the support, protection, and defence of those very rights; the principal of which, as is before observed, are Life, Liberty, and Property.** If men, through fear, fraud, or mistake, should in terms renounce or give up any essential natural right, the eternal law of reason and the grand end of society would absolutely vacate such renunciation. **The right to freedom being the gift of God Almighty, it is not in the power of man to alienate this gift and voluntarily become a slave.** - Samuel Adams, [The Rights of the Colonists The Report of the Committee of Correspondence to the Boston Town Meeting, Nov. 20, 1772](https://history.hanover.edu/texts/adamss.html) Republican, but increasingly not in lock-step with the party.

Being a mother is also a career choice, and one of the greatest gifts possible for the rising generation of children. Public Schools and DayCares are not a supplement to good parenting. > Let me dumb this down for you. Man wants sex, finds woman, rapes her, she got pregnant from her rapist How would you deal with this conversation[?][I'll let Ryan answer that from personal experience](http://www.theradiancefoundation.org/ryan/), his mother chose Life.> Back to abortion, do you honestly think that women just get abortions for fun, is it a game to you?[Certainly for some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKrfCow6Lyk).>  Do you really care about other people's kids? Yes, have you ever volunteered or donated to a crisis pregnancy care center?> What is wrong with a women having a choice...Woman have a choice. Life or Death, freedom or slavery of the state.> Today, we are seeing a piecemeal destruction of individual freedom. And in abortion, the statists have found a most effective method of obliterating freedom: obliterating the individual. Abortion on demand is the ultimate State tyranny; the State simply declares that certain classes of human beings are not persons, and therefore not entitled to the protection of the law. The State protects the "right" of some people to kill others, just as the courts protected the "property rights" of slave masters in their slaves. Moreover, by this method the State achieves a goal common to all totalitarian regimes: it sets us against each other, so that our energies are spent in the struggle between State-created classes, rather than in freeing all individuals from the State. Unlike Nazi Germany, which forcibly sent millions to the gas chambers (as well as forcing abortion and sterilization upon many more), the new regime has enlisted the assistance of millions of people to act as its agents in carrying out a program of mass murder. - r/RonPaul, [Libertarians4Life](http://www.l4l.org/library/bepro-rp.html) They don't have to when you have the materials readily available at the school, 3D printing could be a quick way to make one.

No to what? 3D Printing Labs? > were a bunch of vigilantes with no training running around with guns. If you had read the comment, you would see that these are trained professionals, not vigilantes. Untrained individuals should not have guns around children. Banning guns won't help. You can literally print one off in the 3D Printer lab. Having more good people with guns that are specifically trained on how to respond to this would help dramatically to prevent the school from being helpless until the police arrive. Good adults should be trained and allowed to carry guns in school. Arm the Teachers and prevent mass shootings. [It sort of does though](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardens_by_the_Bay) > ... Isn't reddit about the images, videos, comments, and links shared on this site?Sure, but I prefer clicking direct links to images. The browser can give me the full screen, vs. being trapped in a lightbox. Then if I want comments, I click comments and have fun reading pure undistracted comments. I feel like smashing them into one window distracts from both. The lightbox kind of reminds me of Facebook. Never was a fan of Facebook...

Now there's pretty much no way to do that and have it look good. That was Milton Friedman's plan.  Buttigieg just wants to keep all of the existing welfare systems and add the $1,000 a month on top of it. Joe can't talk about how much he loves kids without seeming creepy. > not a Yang supporter but his plan would involve taxing manufacturers not tax payers. Look up value added tax.That's a regressive tax.  It taxes you a higher percentage of income the less you make because the tax is passed along into everything you buy.He must be as racist as Buttigieg with his policy of locking up more blacks for recreational marijuana. I don't see how anyone who pays taxes can support Yang.Sure, the government will give you $1,000 a month.  And he'll have to increase your taxes by $2,000 a month in order to pay it to you and your neighbor who doesn't pay taxes. "How do you explain the increase in black incarceration for marijuana in South Bend under your watch?That is going to destroy Pete Buttigieg with Democrats.We need to repeat that everywhere.  He's a racist who locks poor blacks up for recreational marijuana use. Yes.But parents should be open to charges of neglect in the above case.And if a doctor pushes anti-vax on patients they should lose their medical license. I assume President Bartlet gave Josh a 2am White House history lesson at some point. It's just one guy.  He's a little weird, but we love him because he's one of us. Also, when Republicans retake the House they can expunge the impeachment. "Render unto me the things that are Caesar's" That's what happens when you actively try to make their lives better instead of giving them empty platitudes for half a century. I said a year ago that I hope she doesn't get the nomination.  None of the others have any cross party or even independent appeal. It's a compromise between the large states and the small states.During the 1787 Constitutional Convention, "The Great Compromise" based the House of Representatives on population and based the Senate on equal representation for each state.  In the Electoral College each state gets one vote per Senator and Representative.There never would have been a Constitution and therefore a United States of America without the compromise.

[Caption This!](https://i.imgur.com/BsXxxxd.jpg) They've invented the "Nuisance Impeachment". He's held a grudge against Trump ever since he sold out and went from hating Trump to kissing his ass in an attempt to get Secretary of State only to get nothing.Mitt has become petty and bitter.

Where was this post an hour and a half ago?!Brilliant. Emotional Nancy threw a tantrum. They make up like half their voter base! Water will melt her, she needs gin. They want to use health care as an issue to divide America and attack Republicans.  So they have to oppose everything Trump and Republicans propose on health care, even eradicating AIDS. The paper Nancy keeps reading simply says; "You are at the State of the Union Speech."  It helps her tremendously. "Death to America" America Hopefully an indictment. Probably the latest issue of Imbibe. As is tradition.  They are expected to sit like grim statues for the entire speech. They want people to be dependent on the government. Democrats refuse to applaud for minorities getting jobs. I'm excited to watch the Democrats politely applaud Rush Limbaugh as he receives the Presidential Medal of Freedom.  They'll all be dying on the inside. It's hilarious to me that Congressmen fight like school-kids to get positioned on the aisle to shake the President's hand. It's hilarious to me that Congressmen fight like school-kids to get positioned on the aisle to shake the President's hand. They are locked in for the first ballot at the convention, but after that they can vote however they want. They've been saying inconsistent data all day.The different methods of reporting simply don't having matching data.  It sounds like they are going back to the physical paper from the various precincts as the source of truth.The app was a nightmare.  Several precinct captains couldn't even get it downloaded.  Then many of those who could get it downloaded and installed couldn't get it to upload their numbers.  At this point they need to throw out any results from the app and assume that data is junk. He's basically saying; "If *I* was President this wouldn't have happened, because *I* understand technology."That's absolute bullshit since the President was not involved.  The caucus was run privately by the Iowa Democrat Party.  If he would have said that it wouldn't have happened if he was in charge of the IDP, then he would have had a point.This just makes him look clueless. I perused the /r/politics thread and was surprised to see how much Bernie supporters hate Pete Buttigieg now.  A lot of them are saying they will never vote for him now.The main issue seems to be that he declared victory in Iowa and they believe that Sanders won, so he's trying to steal the news cycle from Bernie. How Democrats do coin tosses to break ties for delegates.  Nothing fishy here.  (Buttigieg vs. Klobuchar - Buttigieg won.)https://twitter.com/awzurcher/status/1224533900946485250?s=20 Joe Walsh humiliated himself at a Republican caucus last night.https://twitter.com/ScottPresler/status/1224529009540726786 You deported them?  You monster! Not important at all.  Most states aren't even having Republican primaries/caucuses.The big take away is that Weld and Walsh have no support at all.  The media was trying to play it up like the party wasn't united behind Trump.  With 97.1% of the vote that narrative disappears. Iowa = **I** **O**we the **W**orld an **A**pology. https://i.imgur.com/Qq9wR9H.png It's an idiotic point.  This disaster is 100% on the Iowa Democrat Party.  The President and government are not even involved.He's smugly pointing fingers at innocent people. https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/1224579227841941504?s=21 Yang just blamed this mess on the President and government not understanding technology.  What an asshat.  This is 100% ran by the Iowa Democrat Party.The Iowa Republican Party had their results reported in like 30 minutes. Warren‚Äôs audience was chanting ‚ÄúCFPB‚Äù during her speech for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.That's not normal. The Wall Street Journal appears to have the best page for Caucus results.https://graphics.wsj.com/election-2020-primary-results/?mod=embed "'We found inconsistencies in the reporting of three sets of results. In addition to the tech systems being used to tabulate results, we are also using photos of results and a paper trail to validate that all results match and ensure that we have confidence and accuracy in the numbers we report,' IDP Communications Director Mandy McClure says.'This is simply a reporting issue, the app did not go down and this is not a hack or an intrusion.

You can watch TV and listen to the radio again. The show must go on and they're running out of prime time in California. So far so good, he got 100% of the Iowa delegates and most states aren't even going to have primaries. Iowa has less than 1% of the population, but I'd still rather see what Iowans have to say than Californians. Combine her campaign & Super PACs and it was [$1.2 billion.](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/graphics/2016-presidential-campaign-fundraising/) I'm assuming they mean the primaries.  She definitely spent over a billion in the general. "Hold on, let me see if I can figure it out from the scent of this young girl's hair." This could be the lowest impact in a long time for the Iowa Caucuses.  The "Iowa Bump" usually comes from a candidate exceeding expectations and getting a lot of news attention for it.1. It doesn't look like there are going to be any huge surprises.  2. Tomorrow's news cycle will be eaten up by the State of the Union.  3. Wednesday's news cycle will be taken up by Trump's acquittal.  4. Democrat Debate on Friday, 2/7.  5. New Hampshire Primary on Tuesday 2/11. In all precinct caucuses, the presidential candidates must meet a viability threshold within the individual precinct in order to qualify as a viable candidate:* min. of 15% for the majority of precincts with more than three delegates.* min. of 16.67% for small precincts only electing three delegates.* min. of 25% for smaller precincts only electing two delegates.* min. of 50% for the smallest precincts only electing one delegate.Supporters of viable candidates after the first initial voting will have their vote locked to their chosen presidential candidate. Supporters of non-viable candidates having received a result below the viability threshold in the first preliminary vote, however, are allowed to vote a final second time, where they can either choose to transfer their vote to one of the already established viable candidates or alternatively merge their non-viable group with another non-viable group in order to create a big enough group to qualify as a viable candidate. They're paying for exciting new ways to call other people racist. Have no Democrats read any other books?  Every literary reference I see from leftists on Reddit is either Harry Potter, a children's book, or Karl Marx. I had to lock a similar thread over on /r/Republican because left-wing redditors who had never even posted in the sub before were seeking it out to post their vileness.  I pity them that they see this as the best thing happening in their lives.This subreddit is a breath of fresh air. Thread locked due to vileness of left-wing redditors. Do you vote for the Democrat you like the most (Tulsi) or for the Democrat who would be easiest for Trump to beat (Sanders)?However, there are moral issues against voting in bad faith.  I wouldn't do it. He had an awful game too.  Winning and losing football games is a team effort, but he did more than his share of the losing. If they see the entire country as fascist...  And they are violently opposed to their twisted definition of fascism...  Then they are violently opposed to the entire country. "Fuck the republic, we need to replace it with the freedom of an all-powerful communist autocracy!" ~Antifa (paraphrased) And... Democrats now support human trafficking.

"Alright.. I am donating to Bernie now. I don't have much, but it's what I can do now. Match me $10 for your candidate. FEC deadline tonight. Here is hoping for a killer election." "Probably unpopular and I hope it never gets to this point, but:The 2nd Amendment exists as a final check to a tyrannical government that no longer represents the will of the people. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre at the point of a tyrannical government yet, but today‚Äôs decision has essentially overturned our system of checks and balances, and gives the executive office carte blanche to do whatever the hell it wants without an effective means for the other branches to counteract it. And when the legislative, judicial, and executive branches are all stacked...I don‚Äôt think I have to expound on why we‚Äôre in dangerous territory. I will say, however, and excuse the pun, that Democrats have shot themselves in the foot by being by and large anti-gun. Instead it‚Äôs been turned into a partisan issue, where the majority of the people that now own firearms are the same that support the side undermining our democracy. Firearms are the last line of defense we‚Äôre supposed to have against a tyrannical government, and by and large it‚Äôs being stripped away by those that think bad days will never come.That bad day may have been today.

"From now on, there's no difference in supporting Trump or Hitler.If you're republican, you are a totalitarian shithead and needs to get out of my sight. Quick." I hope they vote to acquit before the State of the Union.Then Trump can walk in and say; "We have the best Senate.  They exonerated me on all charges against that sad, partisan, sham of an impeachment.  It was all lies.  It was all partisan politics.  And I'm standing here fully exonerated." The acquittal was more legitimate than the charge.This entire thing was nothing but a nuisance impeachment. Murkowski did vote no.  That's pretty much the end of the circus.

The coward waited to pick the winning side. Congratulations, you just agreed with everything I said.The reason the government shouldn't have anything to do with it is because it's a right.  A right is a protection against government powers, nothing more.  If the government could control it then it would not be a right.You have been confusing rights with entitlements, which is the exact misinformed thinking I've been correcting. So you believe a married couple should have to go to the government and get permission before having sex.  Good to know. You are an idiot.Read it again.  All I said is that the government can't prevent people from having sex, consensual sex between adults. My meeting was only missing about a third.  But I think it was more due to his policies.  There's something about 90% tax rates, government spending triple the GDP, and an authoritarian nanny state that is irresistible to conservatives. > outflow of cons to Sanders./r/BrandNewSentence The left intentionally confuses rights with entitlements.Governments have powers and people have rights. A right is simply a shield against government power. That means the government cannot prevent you from obtaining health care. It does not mean that the government must provide health care.Sex is also a right. That does not mean that government must provide a sexual partner for every internet troll who can't get laid.Another example is the right to bear arms. That does not mean that the government must provide an AR-15 to every citizen. You also wouldn't be the one to order it.  Someone else would order it and you would be told to pay for it.  You apparently agreed to this by entering the bar. This isn't the best quote, and definitely not the best person to be quoting.It's not clear from the quote that he's arguing that conservatism needs to be based on solid principles, which it is.  Even today there are those who call themselves conservatives but are more anti-leftists than anything else.  As conservatives we fight for constitutionally limited government, fiscal responsibility, free markets, and individual rights.  The problem with Dabney was that his set of principles weren't conservative, they were confederate.  He was pro-slavery and in this particular quote he was railing against the Northern Conservatives supporting women's rights.  Bad person (even for his time), poor quote, with a nugget of truth deeply hidden. It sounds like Dwight from The Office, but I don't remember that scene. THIS is what I want to see.  Unfortunately there are GOP senators who can be bought to oppose this. What could go wrong?

There's good reason Longfellow honored Paul Revere instead of others in his poem.  Paul Revere did much more for the revolution than ride around saying the British are coming.He was a key member of the Sons of Liberty and helped plan the Boston Tea Party.  He spread propaganda about the Boston Massacre.  During the war he made cannons and gun powder.  He minted the first American currency.And during the fateful night, he was in charge of the group of people tasked with warning about the British.  He came up with the one if by land, two if by sea warning.  His responsibility when it happened was to go warn Samuel Adams & John Hancock, which he did.  Having completed his mission he then rode for Concord, was captured on the journey, but then released.He deserves for more praise than one else who rode to give warning that night.

Which ever side gets him the most attention. Obama and Hillary both also opposed same sex marriage.  Then just 3 years later Obama launched his reelection campaign and supported it.  Suddenly anyone who opposed same sex marriage was a bigoted out-of-tough dinosaur.From mainstream Democrat position to hate speech in 3 years.The left is charging further left at an insane pace.For decades Bernie was an Independent because he was way too far left for the Democrat Party.

They are American citizens. Each state has their own filing deadlines and requirements to be on the ballot for the primaries, caucuses, and general election.  Most of them are in December, so it's extremely unlikely Hillary would jump in at this point.Also, the Iowa caucus is February 3rd.  The New Hampshire primary is February 11th.  And Super Tuesday is March 3rd.  So, even a write-in movement would need to be kicked off in time for Super Tuesday.In theory, she could get nominated at a brokered convention and win the nomination without ever being on a ballot for a primary or caucus, but that's just theoretical and would require bizarre circumstances (like a candidate dying).https://ballotpedia.org/Important_dates_in_the_2020_presidential_race And once you got it all working perfectly your parents would unplug the VCR at night "to save electricity".

You're not defined but what you don't believe.  You're defined by what you *do* believe. They were Italian and Austrian philosophers with their main body of work occurring in the era between WWI and WWII.The general philosophy was to look to a centralized federal government to regulate virtually all aspects of society; including the economy, education, religion (or typically the lack thereof), media, art, science, and even the morals of citizens.This aligns very well with the modern left's stranglehold on education, media, art, and science.  Plus their push to remove religion from all public institutions.  Then there's the cancel culture where tolerance is now insufficient to them, they demand that everybody enthusiastic embrace their cultural dogma or be ostracized. Not really, no.The core of conservatism is individual rights.  To protect individual rights government power needs to be limited and local.  Nothing is worse for individual rights than putting all the power in a massive federal bureaucracy.  That's especially true when most of the people who love massive federal .bureaucracies hate individual rights and support identity group rights instead. Ironically, liberalism also has roots in the philosophies of Locke; but that's classical liberalism.  "Liberalism" as rebranded by the American left is an ideology that embraces authoritarian central power.  To find the roots of this modern form of "liberalism" you would have to look to Giovanni Gentile, Franz Borkenau, and some aspects of Marxism. They know for a fact they don't have the 67 votes needed in the Senate and that there is no possibility of ever getting them. World leaders agree, they haven't.

Healthcare is a right, but not an entitlement.Governments have powers and people have rights.  A right is simply a shield against government power.  That means the government cannot prevent you from obtaining health care.  It does not mean that the government must provide health care.Sex is also a right.  That does not mean that government must provide a sexual partner for every internet troll who can't get laid.Another example is the right to bear arms.  That does not mean that the government must provide an AR-15 to every citizen.---  I do like how Shapiro skips past all of the semantics and jumps right to conservative solutions though. "*Conservatives have, on the whole, accepted nationality as a sphere of local duties and loyalties, defining an inheritance and a community that has a right to pass on its values from generation to generation. The nation may indeed be the best that we now have, by way of a society linking the dead to the unborn, in the manner extolled by Burke. And for this very reason it arouses the hostility of liberals, who are constantly searching for a place outside loyalty and obedience, from which all human claims can be judged. Hence, in the conflicts of our times, while conservatives leap to the defense of the nation and its interests, wishing to maintain its integrity and to enforce its law, liberals advocate transnational initiatives, international courts, and doctrines of universal rights, all of which, they believe, should stand in judgment over the nation and hold it to account.*"  ~Sir Roger Scruton---"*Liberty is not the same thing as equality, and that those who call themselves liberals are far more interested in equalizing than in liberating their fellows.*"  ~Sir Roger Scruton---"*A free society is a community of free beings, bound by the laws of sympathy and by the obligations of family love. It is not a society of people released from all moral constraint‚Äìfor that is precisely the opposite of a society. Without moral constraint there can be no cooperation, no family commitment, no long-term prospects, no hope of economic, let alone social, order.*"  ~Sir Roger Scruton Haha, the having to pay for a new MAGA hat is a beautiful twist.

I would love to know what kind of mistake caused them to shoot down a civilian jetliner right after it took off from their own airport. It's called "brandishing".  It's only a crime if they did not have just cause to draw the weapon. The post title is incorrect.  This picture was from a rally at Hershey, PA one month ago on 12/10/2019. It's called a "push poll".  They use fake polls like this to push public opinion.  It's a common tactic. Or a big girl.  The females are bigger than the males. They shot down a passenger jet.  I don't think we can put limits on their stupidity.Either they shot it down intentionally, mistook it for something else, or locked on to the target and fired by accident. I'm hoping incompetence.  Maybe they mistook it for a US spy plane or other military aircraft.If they intentionally targeted a civilian aircraft then it's unforgivable. The next big question is did they shoot it down on purpose or did they think they were shooting down something else? Rand Paul is a true ideologue.  He sticks to his principles even when it's horrible politically. You gotta laugh at how the left tries to claim moral superiority by demanding government provide charity with other peoples' tax dollars while conservatives consistently give several times more of their own money to charity than liberals.  Republicans even give a higher percentage of income to charity after removing religious donations from the equation.

It was intended for an era when there were only half a dozen channels on TV and a dozen on radio.  The concern was that without the doctrine there would be no way for people to hear contrasting opinions.  That clearly is not the case today.Today we have the internet, cable news, & satellite radio - none of which are covered by the fairness doctrine.If the fairness doctrine were reinstated today the only practical impact would be to radio talk shows.  These tend to lean right due to the nature of the audience.  This makes any attempt at reinstatement nothing but a partisan attack on conservative radio.

Yes, the alt-right is incredibly similar to the left.  They have an intense victim complex and see everything to identity tinted glasses.

They support protectionism policies, secure borders, and reduction in legal immigration.As you pointed out, the problem is the alt-right tries to gain credibility by disguising themselves as new-right or conservative.

It can only exist until the majority discovers it can vote itself largess out of the public treasury.

Some choose not to.People who would use the force of the state to dictate what they wear one way are the other are eerily similar to those who supported Khomeini.  And they are the same as those who want to tear down memorial with Christian crosses in the name of "freedom from religion". Picture from Iran before 1979.  https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/shah-iran-pool-copy.jpgLook at that, Muslim women wearing ordinary attire for swimming.  Meanwhile there were other Muslim women who would never be seen in public in a swimming suit, by choice.Then Khomeini took over and the state took away their religious freedom.Amish women have dress codes for when they are in public.  Orthodox Jewish women have dress codes for when they are in public.  Nobody cares about that because it's not a crime against the state if they don't. People saying that hijabs or burkas should be banned are ridiculous.They are not that different from nuns wearing a habit.  Should habits be banned as well?It's only a problem when the state makes them mandatory.  That's when it becomes an act of oppression.

I remember when OWS called them [Up Twinkles.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement_hand_signals#Example_signals) Keenum threw a horrible lob pass that should have been intercepted.  Rhodes kept his back to the ball and never even looked back.  Instead, he clothes-lined the receiver and then let the ball bounce off the back of his helmet.It might have been the worst play in Rhodes' career. NEW crimes?  They haven't found any old crimes. Reminds me of Cris Carter in his prime. [Reminds me of Leroy Hoard's 3rd & 37 conversion.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2DHO8Ewhmo) It may have something to do with bad teams having higher draft picks. The Vikings only had 8 possessions.  1 ended in a Touchdown.  4 ended in Field Goals.  1 ended in a fumble.  2 ended in turnovers on downs.  We ran the ball 38 times and Cousins went 23/26; so we were burning through the clock like crazy.  Washington did their share of clock burning when they had the ball too. We ran the ball 38 times and Cousins went 23/26; so we were burning through the clock like crazy.Plus four field goals, one drive got killed by a fumble, and two drives died with turnovers on down.I guess it makes some sense. We ran the ball 38 times and Cousins went 23/26; so we were burning through the clock like crazy.Plus four field goals, one drive got killed by a fumble, and two drives died with turnovers on down. It seems like you should score more than 19 when you don't punt.Weird game. 3rd and 19.  We run the same play we have run 6 times in a row.It works. I wonder if we broke the record for the number of times we've had 1st and 20 in one game. Cook just broke 150 total yards. Cousins needs 15 yards to break 300 four games in a row.

Washington - "You call *that* helmet to helmet?  I'll show you helmet to helmet" Nice footwork.  Looked like Cris Carter out there. In this game Adrian Peterson has now passed both Jerome Bettis and Ladainian Tomlinson for 6th all-time in rushing yards. It was not a good deal but we love the Vikings, so what can you do? Is going 3/3 for field goals allowed?  It feels wrong. Heh Helmet to helmet will always be called. The best part was the ball bouncing off the back of his helmet at the end.  It was a horrible lob pass that should have been intercepted.  It could be the worst play of Rhodes' career. 7-0 baby.And hasn't Tampa Bay won the division more recently than the Lions? Ouch.  That Wisconsin game was ugly.  And the Ohio State game wasn't much better. Well, the Redskins can't stop a screen from going for fewer than 15 yards, so apparently that's our play for the night. Still bitter over last week? Let's just give the ball to Cook every play for the rest of the game. Or there's more to defensive performance than the scoreboard.The 1-6 Redskins are moving the ball at will.  And Rhodes looks AWFUL.  I mean Keenum threw a lob pass that should have been intercepted, but Rhodes kept his back to the ball, clotheslined the receiver for a blatant PI call, and let the ball bounce off the back of his helmet. You called it. He wants it to be pronounced X-avier now. LOL at Diggs over-protecting the ball and getting down this time. OMG Rhodes I would like to, but I'm still blind from the Seattle uniforms.

The author misses a some of the main causes of the historical growth of antisemitism in Europe.Usury - Medieval Catholics were prohibited from lending money for interest.  However, Judaism did not have that restriction for Jews lending to non-Jews.  The Christian nobles would therefore use the Jews to lend out their money at high interest rates.  When someone couldn't repay it was up to the Jewish moneylenders to collect on the debt, with the assistance of the noble's troops.  The nobles could be as ruthless as they wanted with their lending practices and the Jews took the blame.Restricted occupations - The nobles also limited the Jews to only handful of allowed occupations and banned them from guilds.  In addition to being bankers they were often tax and rent collectors.  Obviously the Jews didn't keep the taxes or rent, they collected it for the nobles.  The Jews also performed the evictions, with the support of the noble's forces.  This setup of Jews to be the bad guys and while people still blamed the nobles they at least had one level of removal from their actions.It's easy to see how this could lead to feelings of contempt and stereotypes of being greedy.

The 59th try is the charm. Cautiously optimistic.The offensive line looked the best it has in YEARS.  Dalvin Cook is healthy and dominating.  Anthony Harris had better be defensive player of the week.  We looked far better than both the Packers and the Bears.  However, the Falcons looked flat.  We beat up on a team that seemed to think it was still preseason.  We also had too many penalties from mental mistakes. I feel like we just beat up on a team that thought it was still preseason.I'm optimistic about this season, but I still have doubts about our offensive line. We finally pulled our starters so I expect that to change. I predict Julio puts up a garbage time TD here. 59 points so far.  I did not see that coming.

(p. 57) This is the stage at which intellectuals line up to state that the country in question‚Äîfor example, the Soviet Union, China, or Venezuela‚Äîwas never really a socialist country. According to Niemietz, however, this line of argumentation is rarely presented during the first phase of a new socialist experiment and becomes the dominant view only after the socialist experiment has failed.---Amazing stuff.

Then when the battle has been won and all of Denethor's forces have been defeated Aragorn arrives with the army of the dead.  Despondent over Eowyn rejecting him and the death of Boromir, Aragorn orders the dead to kill every last man, woman, and child left alive in Gondor.  It turns out Aragorn is the real, real enemy.  Arwen goes to talk to Aragorn in private, embraces him, and stabs him to death.  The army of the dead, enraged over Aragorn's death, destroys the throne of Gondor and leaves.    Pippen is elected King of Gondor, because Gimli says he has the best story.  This is confusing to the viewers because at the end of the previous movie they made a big deal out of revealing that Faramir was actually Aragorn's older brother and the true heir to the throne, but that story arc was never mentioned again. Sounds like a typical reddit leftist. White Nationalism: \*Exists\*    Republicans: Condemn it.  Democrats:  Condemn it.  Conservatives: Condemn it.  Liberals:  Condemn it.  MSM:  \*OrANge MaN BAd!\* One thing I've noticed as a mod of a few subreddits is that people like to report things they don't agree with just to get them in front of a mod.  They'll often just report it for "no reason" or "spam".  They know it doesn't break any rules, but they don't care about that, they disagree with it want it removed.  The odds of a like-minded mod agreeing with them and removing something for no good reason is greatly increased when you report something to put it in front of a mod with the context of "there is something wrong with this post".  And when you have a sub like /r/politics where you have 60 left-wing mods and 3 "conservatives" you can almost guarantee that one of the 60 will find an excuse to remove a conservative leaning post. He's an Antifa mass killer, but I doubt he's their first. The mind blowing part will be that Bran becoming king will actually make sense and we'll be happy about it. They spent years screeching "Racist" at the top of their lungs anytime a Republican did literally anything.  People became tone death to it and voted for Trump in 2016 despite their constant lies.  So now they are screeching "Nazi" and "White Supremacist" at the top of their lungs anytime a Republican does literally anything.  Having a tactic other than screeching lies at the top of their lungs has never occurred to them. The Leftists keep having to say crazier and crazier things to get attention over each other.  I'm not even sure what can top inciting political genocide.  I guess we'll find out tomorrow.

It's a lot harder now that the patent has been granted, but not impossible. Now if Reddit or Twitter shadowbans someone they might have to worry about Facebook suing them for patent infringement. /r/ChapoTrapHouse We're positive. * Kamala Harris: The Democrat establishment forced Hillary through last time and they are solidly behind Kamala Harris this time.  That means money, connections, and positive press.  The problem with Kamala is her history as a District Attorney in San Francisco and then the Attorney General of California.  She's going to have a tough time getting 95% of the black vote and getting record black voter turnout like Obama did with a history of locking up young blacks for minor crimes and blocking DNA evidence from death row appeals.* Joe Biden: Biden has the remainder of the Democrat establishment, the team Obama types vs. the team Clinton types.  If the other candidates somehow manage to take down Kamala Harris then Grandpa Gropey should be able to waltz across the goalline.  * Bernie Sanders & Elizabeth Warren: Wall Street donates a lot more to Democrats than to Republicans because the party of big government goes hand-in-hand with crony capitalism.  There's no way they are going to let a Socialist win and ruin the fun.  Nobody with a brain wants the US to turn into Venezuela.  And if there's one thing we can rely on it's corruption within the Democrat Party.* Tulsi Gabbard: The long shot.  If Harris gets labeled a race traitor, Biden gets busted in a sex scandal, and Warren & Sanders have mysterious heart attacks then I'm putting my money on Gabbard.  She's smart and capable and if momentum starts building behind her it's going to be hard to stop. "See this?  Armpit stench.  It's the 21st century and what I'm doing right now is legal and it's destroying our climate!  That's RACIST!  As President, I will REGULATE armpit stench." DuckDuckGreyduck That's why they launched vicious attacks against Tulsi the day she announced her candidacy.  They had the dirt saved up and ready to throw. Kamala is an idiot, but she has the support of the Clinton insiders.  They rigged it for Hillary last time and they'll rig it for Kamala this time. At this point this debate should be considered an illegal contribution by CNN to Kamala Harris.  She has either gotten or been asked to respond to every question. /r/Marianne2020 is hilarious.  They have submission flairs like "A message from the astral plane", "Lovefest", & "‚¨ÜSPIRIT SURGE‚¨Ü".  Plus their snoo is a crystal ball that says "LOVE WINS" when you hover over it. It's not nice to mock people with mental disabilities. The USA also does not have any biological or chemical weapons of mass destruction.  Our answer to such an attack would need to be nuclear. Pretty much everything except tax cuts.  Make them vote to raise taxes instead of letting tax cuts expire. "Nuclear bombs have negative auras.  We should use them for flowerbeds." Why aren't they calling on the Hippy Lady for foreign policy?  I bet her answer would be legendary. LOL - Open borders Amy is suddenly all about 'America First' She must use the same makeup person as Bernie.  Those bright lights will make you look awful if you don't know what you are doing. Delaney reminds me of the "Inconceivable" guy from 'The Princess Bride'. He's debating tomorrow night. They believe that they have a path to victory.  They want to set themselves up as an alternative to the lunatic left (Sanders & Warren) and hope something drives Biden and Harris out of the race.  Because the eventual nominee is going to be the top Dem not named Sanders or Warren.  The DNC is still corrupt and is too smart to let it go to either of them. I took a peak at the /r/politics thread and it's actually rather entertaining.  They apparently hate every candidate not named Sanders or Warren. This might be the worst collection of candidates ever assembled. "Democrat fear-mongering made a 13-year-old cry.  Give me all your guns!" "Wishlist Economics" is a good line.  I'm sure someone on the Trump campaign is saving that soundbite for a general election ad. That was a popular satire post that makes fun conservatives.  Reddit has always been far-left trash.1. Homosexuality is not natural, much like eyeglasses, polyester, and birth control.  2. Heterosexual marriages are valid because they produce children. Infertile couples and old people can‚Äôt legally get married because the world needs more children.  3. Obviously gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children.  4. Straight marriage will be less meaningful, since Britney Spears‚Äô 55-hour just-for-fun marriage was meaningful.  5. Heterosexual marriage has been around a long time and hasn‚Äôt changed at all; women are property, blacks can‚Äôt marry whites, and divorce is illegal.  6. Gay marriage should be decided by people not the courts, because the majority-elected legislatures, not courts, have historically protected the rights of the minorities.  7. Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That‚Äôs why we have only one religion in America.  8. Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall.  9. Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract.  10.  Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That‚Äôs why single parents are forbidden to raise children. He put his hand over his heart for the Nation Anthem and it looked more like he was grasping his heart due to a heart attack. I expect CNN to try to turn this into Sanders vs. Warren.  Everybody else will have to fight to get any time.  Then tomorrow night will be Biden vs. Harris.

The actual reason is the Silicon Valley push to de-platform anyone who doesn't enthusiastically embrace the far left. They really gave her every advantage tonight. At least I can stand to look at Tulsi.  Hope she wins the nomination. Tim Ryan is actually making sense, he won't be invited to the next round of debates. 1 question for Elizabeth Warren, 1 question for someone else, 1 question for Elizabeth Warren, 1 question for someone else. > Don't think even r/freefolk will except you guys as refugees.\*accept How bad do you have to suck to not even qualify for these debates? Correct. That's nice.

People who take left-wing style identity politics and apply it to support white supremacism.

More like how Communist China treated Tibet and the Dalai Lama. I guarantee that we enforce those rules more strictly than T_D ever has. If you're doing so from a conservative point of view.  If you're just bashing Trump because it's the cool thing to do and "Orange Man Bad" then you are going to get banned.

Michael Bay's 'Fiddler on the Roof' That's one of the funniest things I've seen in a while.[The original is also hilarious.](https://i.imgur.com/KBsKqi0.png) Now you're making me sad, Bobby B Bobby B - Your boy nailed a Stark girl like you always dreamed of doing, what do you say to that? And then what does Sam do?  First he names his bastard Jon as a direct insult to Jon Snow not wanting another bastard named Jon in the world.  Then he abandons Gilly, Little Sam, and baby Jon to go and be the least qualified Grand Maester in the history of Westeros.  Bobby B - What do you think of Sam? He's super cereal. Unfortunately Dan Crenshaw was recently the sidebar honoree and is therefore ineligible this time around. "So I met this guy named Thanos who had an interesting idea..." /r/politics doesn't have anything about the story, which is particularly sad because you know she had to be one of their regulars. Well, insinuating that someone is a Packers fan *is* the worst insult known to humankind. I like to rewatch "Band of Brothers" every year at this time.  It's an amazing miniseries with a realistic take on D-Day and WWII.  I especially like the interviews with the actual veterans the story is based upon. I'm sure he'd be willing to visit her once she confesses to whatever crimes she has committed. \*shatters subvertedly\* Fuck Olly! Troy is 54% on Rotten Tomatoes and it also had well established source material. And not just that you didn't commit a certain crime you are directly accused of committing.  Prove that you didn't commit any crime. Would be great... if the credits have no mention of D&D. He wanted a bone. If she would have said; "the smartest person she knows", she would have been comparing Sansa to Jon, Gendry, and The Hound.Saying the smartest person she's ever met is ridiculous. And the giant ice spiders.  Where were the giant ice spiders? Your fingers are typing and you're complaining, that's whinging. Aye, but you don't hear anyone else whinging about it. They heard a rumor CNN was recruiting new "reporters" from that subreddit and had to up their fake news game. A good explanation for why nobody objected to Bran being King and the North becoming independent would be that they had no intention of allowing it to be permanent and didn't want to reveal their schemes. ‚ÄúI make movies for teenage boys. Oh, dear, what a crime.‚Äù ~Michael BayHe knows exactly what he is and delivers exactly what is expected of him.You cannot say the same for D&D. 20 years from now they'll still believe they only have 12 years. I agree.  They could have had Dany kill thousands of innocents while killing a few Lannister soldiers and leave some grey area where we can discuss how much collateral damage is acceptable. It's as though they did not trust the audience and decided to make it black and white so there was no room for debate and everyone had to agree with the ending. There's no rationalizing character actions that have no motives.  Instead we must chalk it up to flawed writing.D&D wanted to make sure the viewers would be okay with Jon killing Daenerys in the finale, so they made her do something unjustifiably evil.The problem with that is unjustifiable actions come off as incomprehensible without laying the groundwork over time beforehand. Oh, it's blatantly fan service.  But what about Gilly and little Sam?  Did he "forget" about them? Jon is getting sold short here.He is almost solely responsible for organizing the army to fight against the army of the dead.   Sure, he didn't personally land the killing blow, but he deserves as much credit for the win as Arya. Maesters cannot marry, right?So in the show's finale Sam essentially abandoned Gilly and little Sam? Melisandre, while having a vision of the people Arya would kill, said "we will meet again".Melisandre saw he own death in Arya's eyes.  A theory reinforced by the fact that Melisandre was on Arya's list.D&D decided to hijack the prophecy to justify their poor writing instead. Damnit, I've faithfully hated Aaron Rodgers for 14 seasons and now I suddenly like him? > ["Fever is the first sign of the disease, followed by painful spasms that make the victims seem to be dancing wildly and uncontrollably.

Then you at least try to have it make sense when he returns to Cersie.  "Brienne's dead, there's nothing left for me in the North."

Removed: This is a duplicate post.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/bptj3w/caravan_of_unborn_babies_heads_toward_alabama_to/ The results likely would have been different if she didn't wait until after they surrendered and then specifically target the innocent civilians.It's not WHAT happened, it's HOW it happened. They would need to remake seasons 7 & 8 if they wanted to do it right. Yes.  The sub is named after a podcast that derived their name that way.Some of them might argue that it's supposed to be "ironic". Chapo: El Chapo - Vicious Mexican drug lord / cartel head.  TrapHouse: Slang for crack house.Real classy group over in that subreddit. Bad orange man stole Hillary's turn! I'd like to see something happen with House Glover.  They betrayed the Starks twice by refusing the call for the Battle of the Bastards and the Battle of Winterfell.Sansa can't let that go unanswered.  A line or two explaining their fate would be good enough. Try saying that over at /r/asoiaf.  The die-hard book readers generally agree that the right plot points have been hit, but it has all been rushed and written terribly. I've found that the only ones who loved the last episodes are the ones who haven't been following the show very closely.If you have literally never watched an episode before then 8.5 would have been amazing. Yeah, I watched that part of the post-show interview.  That's what happens with bad writing. Exactly.I cheered when Arya killed the Night King.  But then once you take 3 seconds to reflect on it, you realized it didn't make much sense.  They seem more interested in shocking us than having a coherent story.  In earlier seasons we would be shocked by things like Ned's beheading and the Red Wedding and say; "Wow, they actually did it."  This season we are shocked by things like Arya, Rhaegal, and Daenerys targeting innocents and say; "What the heck was that?" That would have been a hundred times better. When the masters retook Yunkai she had advisers telling her to kill them all and advisers telling her to be merciful and give them another chance.  She chose mercy.She offered the Tullys the chance to keep their lands and titles if they bent the knee.  She offered mercy.  They refused.Yes, she has also been ruthless with her enemies.  But never to the innocent.That's my complaint.  She has always been in a moral grey area.  They could have kept that going and simply have her take things too far to win.Instead they have her wait until after she had won and then have her attack the innocent instead of Cersei.  They made her entirely morally black, pure evil.  It was contrived, inconsistent, and unnecessary. Biden called going after Osama bin Laden "one of the most gutsiest calls of any president in recent memory".I don't see how a call could get any easier.  They gave it a 70% chance of success.  If the public found out they had a 70% shot at getting bin Laden and thought it was too risky to try there would have been riots.If you think that was a difficult call and might not have been able to make the same call then you don't belong anywhere near the oval office. Yes, there was some foreshadowing that she had some Targaryen anger in her.  However, they consistently showed that she was compassionate and genuinely cared about the people she ruled.She claimed all of the women so that the Dothraki couldn't rape them.She freed the unsullied not knowing for sure what would happen because she refused to own slaves.She chained two of her dragons because Drogon killed a child and showed genuine remorse over the loss.Even with all of that, it could have been acceptably for her to turn mad and burn the city if it was in the heat of battle.  Having her do it after she had already won was simply manipulative writing with no justification in the story or the character. They easily could have given Daenerys some moral grey area, but they didn't trust the viewers.Daenerys, the hero and protector of the common people since the beginning, sits atop Drogon above a field of victory.  She has burned the Iron Fleet, destroyed the Golden Company, shattered the front gate to King's Landing, and burned every scorpion.  Now the Lannister army has surrendered and the bells are ringing.  The city is hers.  She is finally the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.She looks out towards the Red Keep where she knows Cersei is still alive.  Rage fills her as she remembers all she has lost to reach this moment.  She takes to the air and... burns all the common people alive.WTF?!They went over the top to make Daenerys undeniably evil.  Black and white, no room for judgement at all.They *should* have made the battle a bit more difficult and had her burn civilians along with soldiers.  They *should* have left room for some debate about how much collateral damage is acceptable.  But they didn't trust the viewers.  They had to force our emotions so that we will have no choice but to agree with wherever they take the story next. > ‚ÄúWhen your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.‚Äù I guess "valonqar" means "ceiling" in some language. I was positive that was how it was going to play out.  It's the only thing that made sense. Well obviously he's with Yara.  He's a great sailor and former smuggler who knows the waters around King's Landing as well as anyone.  Having him anyplace other than with a fleet a ships would be ridiculous. Gerrymandering is not a factor in state-wide votes. The problems with season 8 go far beyond the female characters. Only problem - a narcissist would expect people to pay to observe them. They seem determined to shock the audience, story be damned; so at this point we can't rule anything out. I liked the episode until they left Winterfell and pulled another Euron surprise.  I think it would have had an average score. Well Gilly already named her first son Sam, so a second son named Sam would be silly. I would love it, but if they can't afford the CGI to have Jon say goodbye to Ghost, then they can't afford a spinoff with Ghost as a main character. So the Knight King never would have made it past the wall without the dragon?  Everyone was worried for nothing?No, keep rewinding. It can be "abridged" if you are convicted of a felony. Where else would you look for a dragon? * Skirmishers.  Dothraki use bows let them shoot arrows with dragonglass arrowheads from the distance, retreat, do it again.* Hold them in reserve to attack the flanks after the infantry is engaged in the main battle.* Use them as infantry.  They are pretty bad-ass fighters even off their horses.  You have walls.  You are defending.  Why attack at all? All that they had to do to have it make sense would have been to have Daenerys arrogantly fly in for the attack and have the surprise be that they can now shoot down dragons. > Can‚Äôt wait for the books.You still think the books will ever be finished? He's looking for Drogon, but can't see him coming.  Drogon has gone submarine mode.  We've seen them dive under water for fish before.  He's going to pop up from the water and melt Euron's face.  Her Majesty's Submarine: HMS Drogon. [Fine.](https://i.imgur.com/c4jt321.png) There's also no way that Daenerys wouldn't see the fleet long before they could get a clear shot at her dragons.They are so eager to "surprise" us that they throw logic out the window.  Have her spot the fleet and attack and then lose a dragon to a volley of ballista shots where most of them miss.  At least then we could choose to let ourselves believe it. It was great until they left Winterfell. The Dothraki did not ride off on their own, they were led by Jorah Mormont.Jon said at the beginning of the war council in the previous episode that; "We can't beat them in a straight fight."So why was the strategy to try to beat them in a straight fight?Everyone knows the real answer.  It's because they wanted the stunning visual / emotional effect of all of the flaming swords going out.Good writing would have been to have them charge off on their own and have someone react negatively to their undisciplined nonsense.  Then they could have both the visual effect and a coherent story. The thing I find most interesting about this amendment is that prohibition required a Constitutional Amendment.  Today the Federal Government can ban things similar to alcohol today simply by having some bureaucrats classify it as a schedule 1 drug. 19-0.  They are winning it all now that they have TEs.

Jaime had better reveal that Cersei is planning on betraying everyone. What if... the Night King and his army simply avoid Winterfell and keep marching South where there is less resistance and he can build up his numbers until they are completely overwhelming? I say give him Highgarden. > Bronn's not stupid.Which is why he's unlikely to walk into Winterfell and tell Tyrion to pay him double "several chests of gold" or die.  Why would Daenerys agree to give up that much when they could just kill Bronn instead?  And even if he does figure out a way to force the issue what's his escape plan?He's not getting double.  He either kills them or keeps Cersei's gold and doesn't kill them. ‚ÄúWe know no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark.‚ÄùJon's real name is Aegon Targaryen, so that's a no.Alliances with the subs for Sansa & Arya would make sense.

It serves no other purpose.  Anyone who suggests it wants to ban all guns and is trying to accomplish that in small increments.* The age of adulthood is 18.  This nonsense of taking away rights until you are 21 needs to stop.  It's age discrimination and it's insane that we are legally allowed to discriminate against people from 18-39 in this country.* Gun ownership is not about hunting.  Aggressively trying to tie it to hunting like this is an indirect way to attack gun rights.* I would be okay with firearm safety being taught in public schools, but it shouldn't be required to own a gun.  You don't have to pass a civics class in order to vote.  You don't have to pass a speech class in order to speak.  You don't have to pass an ethics class to be a journalist.  Gun ownership is too important of a right to allow the government to put up barriers.* Basic hunting rifles *are* semi-automatic rifles.

Kirsten Gillibrand and going after Al Franken while protecting one of her male staffers who sexually harassed another staffer.  Cory Booker and *we'll see soon*.)  Meanwhile they are leaving the candidates who appeal to the lunatic Socialist primary voters alone.

Up until now we've seen how the Constitution is like a "deny all" firewall rule strategy for the Federal Government.It starts out saying that the Federal Government has no powers whatsoever besides those specifically granted to it.  It then goes on to list those few powers that the Federal Government is allowed.Since the entire purpose of the Constitution is to define the structure and powers of the Federal Government there has been very little mention of the individual states.  Each state or commonwealth was expected to have its own Constitution to define its structure and powers.The 14th Amendment changes all of that.  This Amendment fundamentally transforms the Constitution.  It now controls the powers of the individual states in addition to the Federal Government.What's more, when combined with the 9th Amendment (*The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.*) the Supreme Court can use the 14th Amendment to enforce any right imaginable and severely restrict the powers of the individual states.This was an enormous power grab for the Federal Government, power which can be used for either good or evil.  People who love centralizing power in the Federal Government tend to see this is one of the greatest Amendments.  Ardent supporters of division of powers between local, state, and federal governments tend to like some clauses of this Amendment and despise other clauses. "Illegal Alien" is the legal term used in legislation. The greatest moment in Australian sports history. Seriously, people were even betting on it happening. The New Jersey Reds (AKA The Washington Generals), they won 100‚Äì99 on January 5, 1971 in Martin, Tennessee, ending their 2,495-game losing streak vs. the Harlem Globetrotters. If Virginia wins the championship people won't say "Virginia has won their first NCAA Men's Basketball Championship".  They'll say "Virginia is the first team to lose to a 16 seed and then win the national championship the following year".That loss will be brought up every time Virginia basketball is brought up until the end of time. And they won by 20 (74-54).  They blew out the top team in the country. From 'Miracle' (2004)**Herb Brooks:**  "All-star teams fail because they rely solely on the individual's talent. The Soviets win because they take that talent and use it inside a system that's designed for the betterment of the team.

ESPN exclusive: What changes need to be made to ensure the top teams make the Final Four? With Duke/Zion out, the tournament is as good as over as far as ESPN is concerned.

Gary Sinise does good work. Well, the federal government shouldn't be funding education at all.  And it definitely shouldn't be taxing the people of the various states and then passing that money back to those states with strings attached.Education should be funded and the local and state levels and federal taxes should be cut to compensate for the adjustment. Then you must hate the Alt-Right, because they are all for harming non-white children. Hate isn't a traditional value and hate is the defining characteristic of the so called Alt-Right.  Everything else is negotiable to them. The Nordic states have started to transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2.  Their relatively small and homogeneous populations have allowed them to hold onto their agrarian culture ethics for longer than normal.  However, they have maybe one generation left before the government sector outgrows what the private sector can support and the downward spiral begins. I disagree that they are to the right.They claim they are, but they have no conservative values and have the identity-politic-loving behavior of leftists.Racism isn't a right-wing position.  It's also not a left-wing position.  It's a scumbag position.  However, identity politics falls solidly on the left.  So I see attacking the so called "Alt-Right" as punching left. Yeah, no.  They are the scum of the Earth.  It's important to differentiate between the New Right and the Alt Right.* The New Right - Typically not interested in politics or political ideology.  Middle class blue collar types who have been negatively impacted by the global markets, the reduction in industrial jobs, and immigration (both legal and illegal).  This used to be the center of private sector unions and the backbone of the Democratic Party.  Now they are Trump supporters.    * The Alt Right - White nationalist authoritarians who behave like leftists by embracing white identity politics instead of minority identity politics.  They often try to claim ownership of the New Right and conservatism in general.  In reality they hold almost no conservative values.  They do hold similar positions on issues such as immigration, but for vastly different reasons.  They should be attacked or ignored depending on the situation.  They have nothing of value to add and exist in too few of numbers to have any impact beyond being a distraction and focus point for negative press. I believe it depends on the extent of the Welfare State.If the state has control of production through over-regulation and confiscates the vast majority of profits, how does that differ from ownership in the practical sense?It may be possible to maintain a partial version of a Welfare State in a capitalist economy.  However, that lasting past 3-4 generations is unheard of in history."The American Republic will endure until the day Congress discovers that it can bribe the public with the public's money." ~Alexis de Tocqueville"It can only exist until the majority discovers it can vote itself largess out of the public treasury." ~Elmer T. Peterson Blaming the targets of the irrational hatred for their irrational hatred.  That's like blaming blacks for anti-black racism or blaming Jews for antisemitism.

Spain and Greece are the most recent examples of prosperous countries that had their economies destroyed by socialism.  They were not as prosperous as the US, but that's true of every other country.  They were 1st world countries.Venezuela was wealthy compared to its neighbors.  Cuba was well on the way to having a thriving tourism industry.There is currently wide spread civil unrest in France over high taxes.  Even the Nordic countries have started to push for welfare reforms (cuts), although that has more to do with immigration. My biggest concern with this is that it takes away the language for us to condemn the actual alt-right and normal conservatives may be tricked into thinking that the alt-right is something acceptable. It's nice when Trump does something for Democrats. They made the Sweet 16.  That's a good season. It always was. Belichick has been bribing refs for his entire time with the Patriots.  Once the proof comes out the NFL will have to strip them of all of their titles.  Tom Brady's official record will be '0 games played'. It could be flipped around as well.  Perhaps they thought dropping the case while everyone was distracted with the Mueller report would provide some cover for their corruption.  Of course the media would rather cover anything besides the Mueller report. A guy from work let his two grade school daughters fill out a bracket.  When they disagreed on a pick they flipped a coin.  They are dominating the pool. March Insaneness. **Food** and **Drug** Administration...... lasers.WTF?  You sure as hell can't eat lasers, but I guess you could technically shoot them up your nose. Memes don't even have to be images.  A meme is simply a cultural reference point.  Hitting someone in the face with a pie is a meme.  Making fun of 1 seed Virginia for losing to 16 seed UMBC is a meme.What you are talking about is an Internet meme.  Simply putting text on an image doesn't make it a meme.  There needs to be a cultural reference point.  [This is a meme](https://i.imgur.com/lg25CoX.jpg) because people understand the NPC reference.  [This is not a meme](https://i.imgur.com/0vxt9Fk.jpg) because it's literally just an image with text on it.Most Internet memes have a common format.  [The surprised pikachu meme](https://i.imgur.com/sohWhy9.jpg) is used to mock people who are surprised when they really shouldn't have been.  For example, you could add the text "Russia collusion enthusiasts reading the Mueller report".  You wouldn't add the text "I like Santa" because that doesn't fit that meme. [This would be a better example of a non-meme image post.](https://i.redd.it/bklggntsqjwy.jpg)They should be treated the same in the rules though. How about how Aragorn handed Merry that +5 vs. Witch-kings dagger from the Barrow-downs?That was a total setup to turn Merry into Nazgul fodder.  Of course he was going to try to take down the Witch-king if given the opportunity.  You don't do something sensible like hide from the Witch-king when you have a +5 vs. Witch-kings dagger.(It was Tom Bombadil instead of Aragorn in the books.) Translation: "We must stop the truth at all costs." This is excellent coverage of the root causes behind the crisis in Venezuela, primarily government control of the market. It's the "a little bit" at the end that really makes the quote. Remember that we did try a dedicated day for image posts a few years ago.  First we did it on Sundays but the day-old images would still dominate the front page on Monday so we moved it to Saturday.  It lasted a few months then we killed it entirely because we saw a noticeable decrease in traffic and new subscriptions.  Non image posts from here almost never get near the front page.At the time I was one of the ones pushing hardest to get rid of the memes, but that experiment brought me around to seeing that an image with a few words is more powerful on Reddit than the most well-written articles. Signs that say; "If you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best." Counterpoint: Joe Manchin. The East coast and West coast are full of RINOs; why would we use a RINO timezone? * Rule 5: "Ridicule is man's most potent weapon."  * Rule 6: "A good tactic is one your people enjoy."To find the final solution to the meme question, we must first ask ourselves; "what role does this subreddit fulfill within the greater conservative movement?".  * Is it indoctrination?  Reddit demographics lean towards impressionable young adults who have likely never heard the conservative side of most arguments.  We could push Ben Shapiro quotes all day and ignore controversial social issues in order to cater to a younger audience.* Is it radicalization?  This subreddit is currently geared towards people who are already conservative.  Is our purpose to take those conservatives and push them farther right?  We could push conservative activism.  Everyone call your Congressperson today.  Let's start a podcast and send representatives to CPAC.  Let's turn /r/politics red.  We should have a political action committee (PAC).* Is it energization?  Motivating and invigorating the conservative base is an important goal.  The conservative movement needs its happy conservative warriors.* Is it information distribution?  Should this be a right-wing news aggregation forum?  Are we Drudge Report with comments?* Is it ideological discussion?  Should this be an intellectual bastion, an institution of conservative theory? The last two are the only roles where memes don't make sense.  If we want to fulfill any of the other roles then the memes must stay. Jibrish, you're an idiot and here's why; it's spelled 'gibberish'. > A request I have is to not allow articles that share names of mass murderers.I believe that's a strategy of the Left to shift the blame away from evil individuals to their political enemies and to push for gun control.If no one will talk about the individual who is to blame then it's much easier to blame the gun instead.

I don't know, it's probably the most picked 16-1 upset in history after last year. Worst pass ever. They also had to play against Big 12 & Big 10 teams.

I only say because i came back and our comments were both at 0 which seemed odd to me and I don't want you to think I was petty and would downvote you because I'm not sure i fully agree. I don't disagree that they will continue to try this tactic. But I also have faith that the American people see it for what it is and will make their opinions known come election day.But if polls are wrong and there is a real blue wave coming at the end of this year, I'd rather impeachment be easier than harder. I don't disagree, but that is always on the table. Tyrants often move swiftly when they have the chance. So I'd rather not have to go down that road if we don't have to, you know?I think the key right now is to assert proper use of the impeachment process rather than create a law that may have unintended consequences. I'm not sure how I feel about it. On the one hand yout point makes sense... the harder standard to meet would in theory make it more difficult to use impeachment as a partisan hit job. On the other hand if we actually did have a real tyrant and their party happened to hold a strong majority in the house, we would have to bank really hard on fortitude of very fallible men to do the right thing. If it were a Democratic tyrant, and the house were 65% Dem, the you would need to convince most of them to vote against their own party.The way it stands now, the risk of a false positive is greater, that would mean losing a president who didn't deserve to be pushed out. A false negative would be devastating, that would be we have a tyrant in power but need to trust the people in his party to do the right thing.This is why the game the democrats played is so damned dangerous. They weren't supposed to use impeachment this way. By weaponizing it, we have repupublicans understandably considering laws to limit that behavior. But the law would have consequences I don't think they are consideringEDIT: just to add to it a little, the consequences of impeaching and falsely removing him or her from office would lead to uproar and probably some significant voting shifts against the party who pushed the impeachment. It would be a natural balance against the false removal, the party who did it will have to live with the consequences of overturning a valid election. However, the consequences of not removing a real tyrant would be the end of our country.The false positive is more likely than the false negative, but our laws are designed for those eventualities. Tyranny will come eventually, so what actually keeps it longer at bay? The democrars have acted tyrannically as far as I am concerned, but the checks and balances worked as they ought to have. It took time and diligence, but they worked. The tyranny that is scarier but less likely in the immediate future is the one I worry about. We've never faced that test, so I want to make sure we have the tools in place to handle it when it does. So you're acting like a child. Good job. I guess you read into it.

And they do, rich and powerful men have women throw themselves at them all the time.But you act like he'a admitting to qhat Bill Cosby did in this little statement. That is a dishonest way to read what he said. Women threw themselves at Bill Clinton and Kennedy too. I bet they talked about that with their buddies from time to time.Stop acting like no one ever talks about this stuff. Women can act really slutty sometimes, it happens. It doesn't make the man a rapist when he accepts that behavior and repsonds in kind. It isn't responsible, but it isn't automatically rape like you want it to be.Grow up.

The right still discussed in good faith despite the left supporting him after what he did.You don't seem to remember history and just act like we support rape or something. That is dishonest.

It sounds immoral, it doesn't sound like and admission of assault. We covered this.And yes, you are ruining the discourse.

Don't "lol" and then try to argue when you have just destroyed the conversation.Here's a hypothetical conversation for you:Your friend: "I have some concerns"You: "Lol"Your friend: "Okay..." *leaves*You: *thinks you didn't just ruin the conversation and wonders why your friend left*Also you: *continues to only hear your point of view* Good job. This is why you are confused as to why the left is losing lately. You are not looking at the details, you are merely looking at the tripe pedaled to you by trollish and angry reddit users along with websites like Vox, CNN, and NBC which all are tied to left democrats. So you call Trump a sexual assaultist when the comment made specifically referred to a consensual act. And when we step in and say 2 things, 1) that his behavior was not moral, and 2) that his comment was not an admission of sexual assault, you call us traitors.You "lol" in condescension believing the facts are on your side, so you don't look at them. Meanwhile much of the country actually is looking at the facts and disagreeing with you. Rather than consider that you may be wrong and review our arguments, you double down on the condescension as if it makes you even more right. That is the behavior of bullies and angry, irrational mobs.Well done, you are ruining the discourse, and with it you are ruining the country. First, the head on a pike quip was a response to a democrat saying just that during the congressional hearings about dems not towing the democrat line.Second, the headline here is telling. Throughout history impeachment has been a political process that went down party lines. Yet you lefties all acted as if Republican senators who would vote to acquit were partisan hacks and decided that this a trial just like any other. But this title proves that that view on the left was bullshit.The dems were absolutely insane during this process. They didn't do the investigating that they should have done in congress then acted like that was the senate's job when the senate was given the papers. While this isn't like a regular criminal trial, that would be like the prosecution not doing their job and then demanding the defense find evidence against their own client, and then acting like it is a major injustice when the defense won't pursue evidence against their own client. Perhaps some more specificity about posts is necessary. But charity fits soundly within the free market system and is often indirectly tied to the free market system. While charity can happen within any system, certain forms of it are unmistakably empowered and allowed by the free market system and the freedom for businesses to operate as they wish. And some charities even operate despite government regulations that can stifle charitable causes.Domino's Pizza filling pot holes would likely not happen in a socialist system and the effects of that charitable contribution to society has a secondary non-charitable effect of giving Domino's good PR and some free advertising. That is an effect specific to the free market system.Merely having the profit to be able to be charitable is largely a result of the free market. GoFundMe is a free market solution to sending charitable funds where they are needed.So I think the problem is not so much what you said, but that if the sub is to promote the benefits of the free market to spread the message of why it is important, then perhaps the posts should more clearly make that point, because the people who need to be convinced of the value of the free market will not see the more subtle examples easily. Dems today: anything that is wrong is impeachable... forget reason, forget that some things are wrong but not illegal, forget all of thar because me no like Trump.Dems barely 20 years ago: just because our president committed perjury, an actual crime, but also did immoral things like cheat on his wife with an intern in the physical office of the president, we shouldn't kick him out of office.Grow up, guys. Ad hominem attacks when you have lost an argument suggests you're the dumb one. Lol my way is the honest way, yours is the dishonest way but you justify here for fear of tobacco companies. So you are okay with lying to people if it serves what you feel is the greater good. Whereas I would rather be honest with them... i mean telling people that the odds of getting cancer grratly increase if you smoke is a pretty good deterrent without lying.So have fun lying to people. https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2019/03/22/521240.htm>There will always be a few smokers who would have gotten lung cancer regardless of their smoking habits. **So scientists can say smoking causes cancer in the population at large, but can‚Äôt say for sure that Uncle Joe‚Äôs lung cancer was caused by his smoking habit.**Logically, the first claim here doesn't work. If you can't prove individuals got lung cancer from smoking, then you can't say a population at large got cancer from smoking. All you can say is that it is that smoking puts you at a very high risk for cancer. No, you are wrong and you are not following the scientific method properly.And what's worse is there is no point. The end result is still "You shouldn't smoke because it's dangerous"But my way is honest, your way makes a claim that is impossible to defend. So you decide who does and doesn't deserve cancer. Got it.The left thinks they are God, everyone. We all knew this, but here someone is all but admitting it. No, the science is tossed aside by the layman. Scientists will all tell you that correlation is not causation and that you can't simply say that smoking causes cancer. We can say smoking will most likely lead to cancer, but we can't logically say that smoking will cause cancer. Why? We have proof of people who smoke and live long lives without developing cancer. So clearly there are other factors at play.Saying smoking causes cancer is like saying putting a bunch of guns in room causes murder. There are other factors involved, are all the people well trained in guns? Are they all mentally stable? Are they young? Are they old? Do they have emotional issues?The point is that you can reasonably say that you will likely get cancer if you smoke, but you can't reasonably say that smoking CAUSES cancer. It's a subtle leap, but an important one.https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lung-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20374620Notice the Mayo Clinic is careful to say that "scientists believe smoking causes cancer". They don't definitively say smoking causes cancer. The CDC on the other hand, which has political ties says definitively that smoking causes cancer. That's a political claim, it is made to justify action taken against tobacco companies. The problem is that it is not technically true. If they just said "you greatly risk cancer if you smoke" there would be no problem. But when you say it CAUSES cancer, you are now denying the reality of science. The variation among individuals is so great that you cannot say definitively that smoking will cause cancer or even that smoking was *the* cause of cancer in someone who got it. Genetics, environment, diet, exercise, age, race, stress levels, general air quality... there are so many other factors that contribute to an environment in the body that often develops cancer that you cannot say definitively that smoking is a cause. The direct cause of cancer is typically not the smoke itself, it is the environment the smoke caused in the cells.You are falsely claiming I am tossing science aside when I am adhering to it more than you. So if we removed your comments we would be courageous?Do you hear yourself? Did any of us claim to be courageous? We're merely letting people see how you choose to behave.Be a better person. Yeah, there are some trollish conservatives. Do you see conservatives en masse voting up the same kind of vitriolic trash that lefties are posting about Rush? Nope.Your argument is this:*hundreds of thousands of people cheering about someone getting cancer*You: look! The same or worse behavior!*pointing to a handful of people that are immediately banned while the rest of the people respectfully pray or send their best to the ill.*You: you guys are the worst! Imagine if someone said this about your father when he found out he was sick. In this case though, thousands upon thousands are cheering. First, when RGB fell ill, you didn't see us listing all the horrible court decisions she made. We wished her and her family well. What did you do when Rush fell ill? You charged on over here and pasted a cherry picked, out of context list. Good job. Real classy. The dude has family and people who love him, and this is how you choose to respond?As to your point, there is no conclusive proof that smoking tobacco *causes* cancer, just like there is no conclusive proof that brushing your teeth will prevent cavities. Should you brush? Probably. Should you smoke? Probably not. He was making a simple logical point that you do not like because it goes against the left's argument about tobacco. He wasn't arguing it's healthy. He wasn't advocating for kids to smoke. He was merely asserting the accurate point that correlation is not causation, which is a really valid argument when people are saying "cigarettes cause cancer". Even the government now says that smoking causes cancer, but that is not a logically sound claim. Smoking greatly increases your risk of cancer, but there are so many factors that go into cancer development that it's never conclusive to say one causes the other.When a government just up and decides to throw off reason, lie to the people and say "smoking *causes* cancer", you have a strange instance of the government lying for the greater good. This is a dangerous path to go down. Sugar is linked to cancer, too. Should we lie and say it causes it, and then ban it so we all live healthier? No, that's giving away too much power and we all die anyway.So then he makes this kind of point as people throw around the idea of banning tobacco not as a defense of smoking as a healthy choice, but merely to maintain reason. And then the left takes it out of context and says "see! He's saying smoking is healthy like some backwards asshole from the 50's!" It's dishonest.And he's said some more troubling stuff, but like everything else, the left cries wolf at the drop of a dime and then you expect us to come running every time whem most of the time it's bullshit.Most of those quotes from those posts are cherry picked and pulled out of context or severely misinterpretted. I will not say Rush is perfect by any means, but these trash compilations of cherry picked quotes is dishonest as hell.And they come up so fast, it's like someone was paid to do it or people are just that filled with hate for this guy. As far as I know he's done nothing to warrant hatred as deep and angry as that which is directed his way. The hatred is manufactured by propagandized lists like the one being sent around reddit today.But go ahead, feed the unwarranted hate against this man who has loved ones. Be okay with the idea of people laughing and applauding his death. We didn't make nasty lists about RGB and her horrible supreme court decision record when she fell ill. I think they should just come up with some new IP instead of ruining what they had. My mother used to listen to him, so I'd hear him while I was driving around with her running errands or going to the doctor. I hadn't listened to him since I was a kid except maybe for a youtube clip here or there. But I took a little road trip over the summer and happened to find an FM station he was on and listened to him for about an hour there and then an hour back. He was involved in some kind of charitable campaign he didn't even intend to start but just went with it when he saw there was desire for the products (I think they were just shirts iirc) and that he could help people.Rush obviously had some personal issues he had to deal with. But he was also a lightning rod for the left, so if he made a mistake, they were just on him relentlessly. He weathered all of that. To make a horrible Biblical comparison, he was like John the Baptist to Trump's Jesus Christ. Please don't take that as a literal comparison, I just mean that he helped hold the left at bay until someone like Trump could come along.And listening to him for just a couple hours, and the little bits of him I'd see here and there, it is plain to see how brilliant the guy is. I certainly didn't agree with everything he said as I listened to him, but the insight he had was powerful. Yes you can, you just have to shame people really forcefully and live the life of a hypocrite. It is kind of tricky. There is a difference between racial pride for the sake of equalizing status and the racial pride associated with purifying a nation in some way.In the minds of so many that is a very very clear distinction. To them, the idiot in the photo and the person wearing the troublesome shirt are merely pushing for Latin Americans to be more represented somehow in a way they perceive as equitable (and good luck figuring out how that's supposed to look). But they do not realize that it is a very fine line between asserting, say, that your music is as good as any other music versus saying that it is better. They do not see that their mentality flips into a dangerous one very easily.They also don't see that there is a difference between asserting a national language and forcing all the people to speak only one language. It is not oppressive to have selected a primary language to do business in. You do not have to abandon your culture to speak English. Typical classist tripe. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/experimentations/201803/4-ways-porn-use-causes-problems Get off porn and off social media, you will feel the cloud lift.

Yeah, I agree now that I look a bit closer. The pit still seems suspicious to me still, but I see the imperfections now too and I guess it must be possible with freezing or speed or something. Ha, yeah. Psychedelics were never for me. Pretty sure an avacado wouldn't stay all nicely colored like that for long enough to carve and then to apparantly polish the pit (which looks like some kind of turned and polished wood to me). Even if you froze the avacado. Maybe if you treated it somehow, but I doubt it.Still looks cool though. I respect the craftsmanship, but I find it a bit overstimulating. > In general, we don't need an education system that gets kids to add numbers really well, we need a system that gets kids to understand how numbers work, holistically, and how mathematical concepts tie them together.I disagree with you here. This is going to sound trite, but this is true on multiple levels. When you do not understand the basics of something, you cannot appreciate the more lofty ideas you mention, but what is worse, you lose the tools to figure out if they are wrong.And again, those are high level concepts you are talking about. When I said that 11 is about the earliest you can start thinking about abstract thought, that's just when they start, and that's on the early end. The brain doesn't really even fully develop until about 24, as it relates to complex, abstract understanding.Further, if you fail to teach the fundamentals and practical thought in favor of trying to teach holistic concepts, you can blind the young to reality of the situation. Basic math will always be an asset to someone, we SHOULD be teaching people to be good at adding, it is relevant to us all every day.What I think you and many others do not see again is that if you want to teach these higher concepts, you end up just teaching rote memorization of ideas that the student can't really appreciate until later anyway. One of the things that they keep trying to push in social studies classes these days is this idea that nationalism serves two basic functions, bringing a nation together and tearing them apart. That is not how it works.Like in Social Studies, you might teach what communism is vs. capitalism. I was a really smart guy in high school. I understood the basics of capitalism and communism, but I did not really grasp the totality of those systems until later when my brain developed more. You cannot force higher concepts into the minds of people whose brains haven't developed enough to understand it. Adults then think "Yeah! We should teach more high concepts!" and of course that sounds great, but what ends up happening is you dumb down the concept and it just becomes another rote endeavor.Have you ever read junior and senior level political papers? There are a few who have a good grasp of any complex issue... they have a grasp of maybe a few details in a greater issue, but very rarely do they really understand an idea like capitalism on a philosophical, fundamental level. I don't mean having like an encyclopedic knowledge of every kind of capitalist country, every form of it, every time it seemed to fail, all the success. I mean the archetypal understanding of what it is an how it works. I mean the kind of understanding where you can actually see a question and then answer it with respect to how a capitalist might handle it... and I don't mean the cartoonish cynical way, I mean an honest, specific way.>But if the only way we present math is showing an algorithm for how to add numbers when everyone has a phone that can do it for them, kids will start to ask why this even matters. I know I did, as a kid in the public education system.You seem to be getting caught up in the repetition and acting as if we still teach basic addition in high school. That is not what happens, though if you don't make kids actually add on paper from time to time, those skill atrophy. And you are missing something that tons of people miss these days. We are incredibly distracted these days and asking to give up skills that keep us independent and multifaceted in our skills so that when we face problems we can deal with them. You may think it absurd to think of a time when you will not have a calculator AND you will need to do math. That isn't the point. The point is that these skills make you harder to deceive, harder to mess with, harder to have the wool pulled over your eyes. Socialism is popular among people who do not see how bad it would hurt the economy and don't know the basics of economics. They have the wool pulled over their eyes because they don't know the fundamentals of economics, government, and human nature.Doing scales is boring, it is essential to building your understanding in music. Unfortunately, some things can't be magically made entertaining... but they can become relatively entertaining when you remove highly distracting things like cell phones from their pockets.There are kids who don't think they should learn how to write essays in school, too. They think it is pointless because they will never write an essay as a hairdresser or a programmer. The thing is, learning to write isn't about sentence structure and thesis statements, it's learning how to communicate effectively. Everyone needs that. Not only that, but writing helps you develop more complex ideas. But writing essays is boring for just about all students.Basic boring skills help you develop a much fuller understanding than just skipping ahead. I think you are touching on a couple different issues. One of them is bad teaching, one of them is changing paradigms in how to teach that don't spread evenly, and another big one is cramming more into what we expect students should learn for the future which is often at odds with learning the important prerequisite skills to really understand what they are learning. It's nice for the state to say "Look, the jobs of the future are going to require more math knowledge, so we should incorporate more skills and demand students reach a higher standard with more skills." This requires more mastery of more skills, which requires more time.Think about learning piano. Even seasoned masters of the craft will spend time on scales. And students early on will get very bored with the constant emphasis on practicing scales. The thing is, you need to practice those scales so that it becomes second nature, then it becomes far easier to deviate from those scales or far easier to jump into them when it's called for in a run of some kind. What is happening in education would basically be like this "There are so many great pianists out there now, and they need to be better prepared to compete." So the piano teacher is like "Okay, I guess." So they stop pushing the practice on scales and spend more time on just knowing stuff. So they might know what lydian and mixolydian scales are, and they can conceive of so much, but they can't actually play any of it because their actual skill development is slowing down as they stop practicing the basics.I watch tons of cooking and woodworking videos on youtube. Conceptually I know a ton about both things. I'm a mediocre cook and I don't woodwork at all, I know a decent amount about how hard certain woods are, but I have no idea how they feel when spinning a lathe, I have no idea how it feels when you hit a snag. So if I actually tried, I could really really hurt myself. And I might be better able to produce something better than a complete novice on my first attempt, there are so many skills in that overall skill set that I am missing. This is an oversimplified but rather accurate view at what is happening in education, sometimes it doesn't matter, sometimes it does. But try teaching essay writing when a kid is barely crafting sentences.In regards to your view about math facts, I think you are a bit off. Students don't really memorize 2+5=7 as a single fact. I agree that that would be worth little. They don't memorize that though. They learn the sequencing, they learn to start at 2 and go up 5. If they have to use their fingers, they do. One of the first tricks they might learn that speeds up the process though is to flip it: 5+2=7. Starting at 5 and counting up 2 is faster and easier to compute. That right there is a skill you could probably teach, but then it goes off on its own in the student's head. Eventually, the calculation just kind of happens. But if you forget, you can always fall back in the sequencing.What you seem to be advocating is I think actually counter to what is natural. First of, kids learning addition and subtracting do not have an ability to really conceptualize much. Not only that, but the development of abstract thought can really vary among students. I think the average is between 11 and 16 when the human brain really begins to develop abstract thought. We teach addition and subtraction in kindergarten or very soon after. We cannot teach concepts to students to enhance their math ability, we NEED to focus on the rote practice and the basic procedures. We do that so that they begin to see the patterns themselves and then start making those connections themselves, which are far stronger connections than what we can instruct into them.Just an example, maybe 5 years ago on reddit I saw this interesting trick that they claimed they use in Asia for multiplication. If you google "Japanese Multiplying Method" you'll find tons of stuff on it. Anyway, it works, and the math behind it is pretty cool. It is a really cool trick, but if you understand the meaning of why it works, then you can glean a lot of awesome understanding of math concepts. However, people here saw it and were like "Whoa, this would be great for teaching kids!" Look up the trick, and try multiplying using that method in your head. Unless you are amazingly good at visualizing images like that in your head and keeping everything straight, you will utterly fail. So the vast majority of people would need to actually draw it out. Frankly, it's faster to just use the standard method. And this Japanese method does not translate to mental math well at all, because you are using so much mental capacity to just visualize the process, seeing the patterns is difficult.But if you add 2+5, and you add 32+25, and you add 72+45... you see that pattern of 5+2 and in each instance there is a 7 in the answer. That is a pattern that just develops as a script in your head so that 2+5 literally =7 in your head. 2+5 becomes synonymous with 7. It's no long the fact "2+5=7", it is utterly equating the concepts of 2+7 and 7... 3+4, 1+6... they don't *equal* 7, they *are* 7. You can't be taught that, you stumble upon that as you play with the numbers for a while and as your brain develops. And if you tried to teach that at the time students are just learning how to add 2 and 5, then you will utterly fail because it's beyond the students. I'm not sure about this specifically but i imagine it is similar to what has happened in math. Students who ar very successful at adding learn the traditional way and then come up with short cuts on their own. Usually, these shortcuts end up being pretty similar... for instance adding 45 to 87, rather than writing out the problem, in your head you just add 5 to 87, get to 92, and then count up 4 in the tens column getting to 132. The thing is that it is even simpler than that explanation, it's just like code in your head.So scientists see this as a common strategy and then someone gets it in their head that if you can skip straight to that strategy by just teaching that strategy then you'd think that more students would be better at adding faster. The problem is that these strategies only work for the people who use them because they have mastered the basic procedure first and have done it so much that the student can naturally make the shortcuts in the process work. If there is no foundation, there's nothing to build upon. So you have all these kids who aleady struggle so much with procedure having to now learn a new procedure that is sort of beyond words. When you try to make something that is as simple as it can possibly be, you end up making it more complicated. Take a step... now write down all the things you have to do to make your body take a step. You might say "shift your weight to one side" but now try to explain that. It is such complex thing and yet we learn it without any words describing how, our brains just figured it out as babies.So if you can even manage to write a coherent procedure for taking a step, give it to someone and see if they can follow it.Rote learning is very effective because it leads to us making our own connections that are beyond our means to communicate simply. People think we can skip rote learning, but they end up needing to drill a newer less tested, counterintuitive procedure that just confuses people.EDIT: typos I'm not a fan of Dr. Phil, but he's actually helping people. This isn't the same thing. No problem! And this is a very flattering response!I do teach English and dabble in writing. I am no professional in the craft though, just someone who appreciates it.Just a brief addendum, you are the one who ultimately makes the decision about your work. Please do not feel pressured to change anything unless it feels right to you. "Ecstasy" and "prisoner" are perfectly valid words and can be very powerful, and repeating "but" can be a great vehicle for changing the tempo of a poem or bringing a sense of sonic structure to it. Here are a couple examples I've posted on reddit before. If you haven't already, look at r/ocpoetry. There is some amazing work that could be published on there as well as work of different skill levels. Looking at what really works next to things that might need some improving can help a lot in seeing how to improve your own work. You can also look at a weak line in someone else's poem and it can make you think about how you would make it better, which helps make your own work better. I've only ever seen encouraging comments, some are more useful than others, but they can really help. Just a warning, I find that some of the best poems there are not necessarily the ones the get the most votes. The ones that get the most votes may be excellent, but sometimes they just have a mass appeal and a message that relates to a lot of people. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that, we all want to write poems that touch many people, but as far as skill and quality is concerned (and if you want to improve) sometimes it's better to do a deeper dive.https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/enwxq4/the_one_who_keeps_the_fire/https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/e5ismh/the_way_the_world_works/ I dig this a lot.I'm usually not a fan of poetry presented anyway other than in a pure text form, but the lavenderish-pink background fits this so well. And the fact it's a screen grab from a phone gives it the modern context of like a Tinder profile or something.I guess the reason I don't really like the visual presentation of poetry these days is because it sort of detracts from the text and I really really want rich imagery and narrative that stands on its own. I think you poem stands on its own.My favorite part is the stanza starting with "Fleeting" and the turn in the last line. I might tweak some of the punctuation a bit like maybe remove the comma between "Fleeting" and "Love"... but that's just a thought. And the last line maybe make "it's" into just "is".All in all, great job! Firstly, you incorporate a ton of imagery which is wonderful. So many poets today like the rhythmic slam style, which is interesting in its own right, but usually lacks the power of well crafted imagery. I think that is because it is more meant to be performed and so it relies more on things like inflection of the words and the rhythm to make its impact. But imagery in poetry stands really well when we read it, which is primarily how we enjoy poetry. So we can linger in those images and the impact can be felt much more powerfully.You also play with the visual structure very nicely and I think it fits what you are trying to achieve.Anyway, I have a few critiques. One is about the imagery itself. There are tons of poems that describe the sun in a similar way that you do... I used to notice this and get annoyed with my own writing because I want it to be original. The thing is there are many sort of stock descriptors of things you will see in poetry or really descriptive prose. So I don't want to critique your use of descriptors like "warm sun" or "burning July sun" because while these are relatively common descriptors of the sun, they can work perfectly well. The trick is to be careful in overusing these kinds of descriptors. You use  *warm sun*, *burning July sun*, *warm breeze*, *radiant energy*, *ocean breeze*. These images are a bit repetitive. It can be really hard to find different ways to describe something that is important to the narrative in your poem, and your poem is all about the disparity between the reality of the outside world and how the persona feels in it. So you recognize the warm sun *should* feel nice, but your persona does not feel it. Repetition in a poem should feel purposeful, so if you repeat a noun like "breeze" it should have an effect on top of the image you are creating.Anyway, just consider that "The salty, ocean breeze hits my nostrils" could be tweaked to avoid the repetition of "breeze" from the third line. "The air carries the salt and ocean/but I smell naught"Another minor point about word choices "ecstasy" and "prisoner" are a bit cliche, so if you are going to use them, they need more potency.  "Ecstasy" in particular is a bit odd to me, I get the point you are making, but the word is about euphoria and an extreme pleasure... but that image feels kind of weird when we imagine it as the readers of your poem. I see an almost free-love kind of stoner hippie world if the regular beach goers in genuinely in "ecstasy", when I think you really intend us to see the regular beach goers just enjoying themselves as beach goers normally do, with frolicking, and splashing, and laughter, and playful screams of children etc. "Ecstasy" is almost sexual, sometimes it actually is sexual. So it's just kind of an odd word for the context. It is obviously hyperbole, and it extends that idea of the disparity between the joy of what your persona sees and what your persona experiences. "Prisoner" as a similarly odd feel to it... are you a prisoner to these feelings? In some ways, certainly, but in other ways it is a choice, in some ways these feelings of isolation and these sort of unfeeling-feelings are comfortable. So is prisoner the right word? I don't know. But it is a bit of a cliche so you should be careful when using it.Again, I love the structure. However, it relies on the repetition of "but"... you see something nice *but* you feel not so nice. This happens throughout the whole of the poem, and I'm not trying to make it sound like that is bad. My point is that the use of the word "but" is perhaps unnecessary... perhaps the contrast of the images alone is enough to convey that what you see is not how you feel. The repetitive use of the "but" does achieve some rhythmic appeal, but it is also a little convenient and a little amateurish. That is not to say some very well known poets haven't use that same tool, however they have the experience and the technique and vocabulary down pat to be able to go back to a rather simple device and use it. It's like a really awesome guitar player writes a simple song... they aren't writing it because they have no other tools at their disposal, they make the choices because they are the most effective an achieving what they want.Plus, you have these great images and feelings that lie in such start contrast with each other, you don't really need to use "but" to denote the point of tension between the images. So for example:"I stand beneath the warm sun/shivering under my coat"Or"The calm, yellow sun brings ecstasy to others/Her radiance falls short of me"Lastly, you are doing what I used to do constantly... and frankly, it is often how I feel in these moments (when I used to have these moments... I can totally relate to this poem, btw, it's probably why I'm taking so much time with it). There is an impotence in your handling of the persona here. Your persona "cannot share" or "do[es] not register" the pleasure of the scene, your persona is alone and these things do not register. The persona is very very passive. That is not to say you should make the persona active, what it means is that the reader will pity your persona more than experience the scene with the persona. That is okay sometimes, and it may be perfectly appropriate for what you are trying to achieve, but you can make it feel less passive with just some minor tweaks. The reader knows that this persona is in some kind of depression or extreme angst. It is so extreme that the persona not only feels trapped, they are a prisoner... there is nothing they can do to escape this. It may be beneficial to leave these feelings and expressions more open ended."I may be freely living in paradise/but the warmth is cold"Something like that removes the finality/impotence of being a prisoner. This revision to your line gives more a sense that you are uncomfortable in sharing in the warmth of the scene rather than imprisoned by whatever it is your persona is dreading or is depressed about.Anyway, this is all just stuff to consider. You have the bones of something great here! You should be proud of the work you have done thus far!Oh! One last suggestion... there is almost no alliteration, hard rhymes, or really even much in the way of softer rhymes. There are a couple moments of alliteration "receive her radiant energy" and "warm water"... I'm not sure of these are intentional or happy accidents. But adding more of these elements can really pull this poem up to the next level... plus is forces you as a writer to explore more options when you try to find a hard or soft rhyme. This asinine. This is a great response. I appreciate the civility and corrections. We definitely agree on a lot. Ok, if you are going to claim they are that corrupt that complete replacement is necessary then you are going to need to prove it. Most of the evidence people list is utterly ridiculous and the logic is twisted beyond belief.Yeah, there are things in place that protect cops. There should be things in place that protect cops, they have a dangerous job and lawyers will hurl all kinds of accusations at them to get their clients off.What you all seem to want to do is tie one arm of all the cops behind their backs because you think there is a huge rate of criminals who are abused by the system. That simply isn't the case. Most arrests and criminal cases go off without a hitch, the cops follow their protocols, and justice is served. More often than not it is the cops who have to watch out for these criminals. It only takes one criminal with a hidden gun to ruin that cop's life and the lives of everyone that loves the cop. And a cop will have to make a split second decision to draw their weapon and fire or not. But social justice folks seem to want to force protocols that dictate a cop can only draw a weapon in very very specific circumstances. You all decide on these measures without actually seeing what a cop has to deal with. While no one wants to spill innocent blood, a cop should rightly be able to keep themselves from being killed in the line of duty and if an otherwise innocent individual seems to draw a gun rather than freeze like they should, then that innocent blood shouldn't be on the cop. It was an error that that person made. You freeze for cops when they say so. But you all act like somehow it's the cops fault when the suspect does something utterly stupid.And you all seem to conflate those tragedies with this vague notion of police corruption. And if I were a cop dealing with a public who will destroy me in the media even though i followed all the protocols, yeah, we might feel like we need to look out for each other.Cops can't adequately do their jobs when it is only a few bad apples we need to deal with. The public needs to calm down. Most cops are trustworthy and just want to do what's right and then people put them in incredibly difficult situations. But that's not corruption, that is about not incriminating yourself. That is good practice for anyone arrested for anything whether the cop is a good cop or a bad cop.This idea that the police force is corrupt to the core is dangerous, guys. Should there be more accountability and transparency? Of course, but if something is "corrupt to the core" as the OP claims, the best thing to do is get rid of it and start anew. That is a terrible idea because it is not corrupt to the core, like any organized entity, it will have some corruption in it. But that is not a reason to burn it all down. We need police. We absolutely need them and we need them to function more or less as they do without dangerous restricts that risk their lives and the lives of civilians.People conflate the actions of a single hotheaded bad cop with corruption. They see a cop who does something wrong but isn't immediately fired or prosecuted as corruption and just assume the cop is going to get off scott free. They fail to see there are mechanisms in place to deal with these things, imperfect though they are.When you undermine police as the OP is doing instead of having a rational converation about transparency, you are endangering all our communities. Great, now do Bernie. These plans are stupid. No problem. Forgive the length of this one, too.And yeah I don't think anyone actually believes one company controls it all, but I think many do believe there are local monopolies... and based on what I've seen, while it might be true there is only one adequate company and while it might be true that that company's practices are not the best, I'm hard pressed to call it a monopoly because there are options out there that compete with those broadband companies. The best right now is probably celular internet. But satelite internet exists. These of course have theit limits, you probably can't enjoy all the big streaming services on satellite internet. Unlimited internet on cell service tends to throttle at a point so you probably can't stream constantly either. But customers having to make choices about their lives and what they have access to where they live is on them.The other kind of weird thing about this debate is that people seem to believe that these kinds of choices are the fault of the internet companies. If you live in a remote location and it would cost the internet company thousands of dollars just to lay the fiberoptic cables and install whatever other hardware is needed, why would they do that not knowing how long you intend to stay there and having no guarantees you will. No business owner in their right mind would take a deal like that... it is like a customer emailing a pizza shop asking for 40 pizzas for a huge event but they don't want to pay right away, *and* the pizza shop doesn't even have a location near this customer. No one in their right mind would fault the pizza shop for applogetically saying that can't serve that customer... I mean businesses will take a loss to gain a customer long term, but they wouldn't take a $20,000 for one costumer paying $100/month for internet. This is just a theoretical number, the costs for laying the infrastructure would depend on the specific job. Even if the customer were willing to pay double that would take 100 months to recoup the losses.So this particular issue is really the customer's. Usually, they chose to live where they do and everyone has the power to move if they are willing to work. Even the very poor have choices and can find low income housing where there is a greater chance there will be decent internet. But despite the fact this is the customer's problem, they seem to conflate this issue with the overall monopoly issue and make it all one issue and one reason to hate these companies, and this aspect of things has absolutely nothing to do with monopolistic practices.Further, price gouging is certainly a common issue with monopolies. But there is a fine line between setting prices at a fair market value and price gouging sometimes. I'm not saying none of these companies are are price gouging, but their businesses are more complex than the average person realizes and the number of things the internet can do for a person is incredible. You can listen to virtually any radio station, any song, you can learn how to change your break pads, you can stream movies, you can read books and articles, you can download plans all kinds of things, you can apply for jobs, buy cars and houses. The value of the internet is far more than we pay for it each month. I'm not saying it *should* cost more, I'm just trying to put this in perspective. So if prices go up, it isn't necessarily because it's a monopolistic practice. And those shitty fees that aren't advertised, while they are shitty, the intent is always assumed as a means to maintain profits. We shouldn't assume the intent of the company. Most companies want to maintain the apparent price of something even when they might face increased costs. There was the video about the Cadbury Egg shrinking over the years just the other day. You can assume that is because they wanted more profit, but it is more likely that they wanted to maintain a balance betwern profit and cost. The price of many components that go into the egg have likely increased, so they are faced with a choice, increase the price or shrink the product? They will do neither with any fan fare, they will either choice goes unnoticed but the increase in price seems to be the most noticeable. While it is a bit underhanded to shrink the product without telling anyone, if customers are still happy with it, does it really matter? Is it something to demonize the company for? Now it is a little different with a commodity that holds more weight in the modern world than a Cadbury cream egg. But the same idea is true, costs of the materials to build and maintain the infrastructure have likely gone up, laws and regulations have likely changed that have increased costs as well. The average customer won't sit around and listen to the reason their monthly costs went up, they often just get mad and cancel. So do you make it public? Do you just quietly change the price and hope people don't say much about it? Do you find creative ways to charge more? If there is a state regulation you have to cover, maybe you designate a certain fee so customers know it's not you who forced this rate increase but the state. I'm not saying that is what happened, I'm just pointing out that these companies are often left to the whims of the government and have to make the best of a crappy situation that a bunch of legislators had no clue about but passed the law anyway. If a law is passed about ensuring an ISP expands into commercially unviable areas at a loss, they will need to recoup their losses. In which case, the government increased your costs, not the ISP. Is that price gouging? Kinda, but the culprit is really the government.Anyway, my point overall once again is that I do not think it is accurate to call these companies monopolies or treat them as such, at least not without knowing the details more, and I don't know a single person who actually knows all these little details enough but I know that government regulation is a factor in why internet costs what it does and I know a ton of the regulation's government has been responsible for across all aspects of life can be absolutely ridiculous and a meams to simply drum up more state revenue. So we should be careful to call yhese privaye industries "monopolies" when often times the government is the monopoly. I primarily have anecdotal evidence (but hear me out and forgive the length) with companies like Greenlight Networks based out of Rochester, NY. It is a company that started about 5-6 years ago in Spectrum entrenched area. It is steadily growing and attempting to move down state and into Connecticut. It is hurting Spectrum in our area and it came about *despite* Spectrum's stranglehold... and also largely *because* of Spectrum's stranglehold. Everyone hated Spectrum and was dying for an alternative, and jumped on the chance, and probably would have at least given it a shot even if it didn't offer competitive rates and quality service... but it offered faster speeds and better service at better rates. Now Tom Gollisano owns it so I imagine it will expand a bit faster and continue to hurt the market share held by the incumbent companies. And with the cable cutting trend spreading more and more, good internet is the key, so companies like AT&T Uverse and Verizon Fios, which both offer fiber optic service, will have to decide what their business is... is it wireless? Is it TV? Is it just internet? The market is changing, which means opportunities are opening up, some that we might not anticipate.I would have to look into the Google Fiber saga, but based on what I have seen, I wonder if the failure was a mix of those countermeasures by both Spectrum and Comcast and their own failed plan. Google Fiber may have bit off more than it could chew by taking on two huge competitors. Maybe they picked too competitive a market to start, I'm not sure. But the fact that this much smaller company called Green Light Networks was able to square off against Spectrum seems to point to the possibility that Google Fiber just had a bad plan. And it makes sense as well because they were heralded as the savior of like all of American internet, it's no wonder Spectrum and Comcast would push really hard to beat them.Anyway, I am not saying there aren't "monopolistic" and rather predatory practices by these incumbent companies. Companies will always attempt to maintain their market share and keep competitors down. But these predatory practices do no necessarily make a monopoly. My point is that just calling it a monopoly is not accurate and actually prevents people from seeing the possibility in the market forces. When you simply call it a monopoly, all of a sudden, the only possible fix is the government (and the government sucks at so much of what it does) when a better option might simply be a little more patience because the market is working on it. Certain kinds of businesses have a much bigger barrier to entry, which means it takes time to build a viable plan, run the numbers, test the market with a trial, and then expand enough to actually compete on a large scale.The problem is that people don't believe this can still happen, and yet it does... frequently. Where was Tesla 10 years ago? Suddenly a start up is doing things no one would have thought could happen when the car industry seems to be about as full as it could be and when the big car companies all over the world were rushing to be the first in hybrid and electric cars. But they failed and Tesla rose.The cable television industry had the market cornered for a couple decades until internet became robust enough to stream... that disrupted the market entirely.About 15 years ago, nobody thought anyone could beat Walmart... suddenly Amazon is putting that notion to the test and Walmart actually had to adopt practices the Amazon put into place.The cell phone industry seemed like there were few alternatives to AT&T or Verizon, now you have all these much smaller cheaper companies that are able to compete in a somewhat symbiotic relationship... but the market forces could change things drastically. If AT&T leases their cell tower bandwidth to smaller companies, but the smaller companies out compete them in the actual cell phone service market, it might become a better business model for AT&T to simply own and maintain cell towers. I doubt that would happen, my point is simply that the market can change in ways we wouldn't expect. There are so many stories about how a company that produced rubber gloves became the largest condom company in America (I made that up because I couldn't think of a real example off hand, but they are posted on reddit from time to time as a TIL).It may be that an internet company decides that it wants to offer internet through wifi hotspots it puts up in neighborhoods and you subscribe and just sign on with no hardware installed at the home at all.What is really frustrating for conservatives/libertarian types is that there are so many examples of times when an invention or innovation changed the game and brought competition where it didn't exist before. Sometimes it just requires time and a willingness to take a risk on something new. But when things don't happen fast enough, when free internet isn't immediately available to all the poor people in the country, when people are frustrated with bad business practices of the incumbent companies, instead of looking for the alternatives and supporting them, they almost immediately go to the government.Did you know that the best charities in the country use about 95% of the money donated to them on the actual cause they are helping. The government is no where near that efficient. We see corruption in government all the time, and the more money and power that goes into the government, the more corruption and misuse of funds is possible. Yet people are willing to just give up that power to the government because they think their internet company sucks? I mean they jump straight from "this company is kind feeling like a monopoly but technically isn't" straight to "the government should control it!" Why not look into legislation to stop whatever predatory practices are involved, look into the lobbying, etc., and then let the market work first. If there is still a problem, then maybe let's find another solution. And maybe in some municipalities or some areas, community broadband makes sense, but to call for it all over the country as if one solution will solve the problem everywhere while stifling competition to an insane degree? That would destroy an entire industry, that would be terrible for the economy.We need to be more patient. That is a fair assessment, but it makes the stat another user point out a bit disingenuous. They passed off the stat that 40% of people not having a choice in internet as proof positive that these markets are all monopolized. The thing is that markets are opening up, it's just a slow process because it is an incredibly expensive cost to enter the market.That is not a monopoly. Having one option for broadband is not the same as a monopoly. You ha e to go to all those areas and prove they are all controllee by a monopoly when the truth is that many of these places merely aren't strong enough markets for the competition to reach them directly. Further, you have narrowed your definition of monopoly to only include broadband, there is more internet competition than just broadband. That's like saying there's only one pizza place in town when there are options, you just don't like the options.That's not a monopoly. That is a market waiting for some viable competition. That's a valid point, thank you for your reasoned point. For the record, i live in a community where competition is healthy and thriving in the internet industry. But i guess valid data doesn't count qhen it goes against your narrative. Where are the monopolies? From where I'm sitting, competition is pretty fierce. Smaller, better companies are putting a massive dent in these "monopolies", which sort of makes them not monopolies anymore. It's just not happening fast enougb for you folks, it seems. They had all the control and fucked it up. They still have pretty much all the manor networks, Hollywood, most newspapers, most local news affiliates, 90% of reporters, the vast majority of college professors, the public school system, radio.... they had it all and fucked it up. What massive losers. Pillaged? I mean I'm not saying they have the noblest business practices, but can we maybe dispense with the analogies to robbing and pillaging? They are providing a service that people choose to purchase. You were the one ignorant from the beginning and now you are simply seeking the higher position by acting beyond reproach. It is dishonest. Forgive the length, I think some context is necessary to understand this but I tried to answer it concisely at the beginning with the deeper explanation after.First, and most simply, an unmarried non-virgin was looked at as a very bad thing in the ancient world across cultures, legal status really mattered back then and marriage afforded a woman certain protections beyond just payment. There were also laws and customs about women who lost their husband that forced the husband's relatives to step in and help. The fact that family was so interwoven into the culture and because bringing the family shame as a rapist, it would mean a man was far less likely to rape. One of the reasons our laws are breaking down a bit today is because our ties to our communities are not as strong as they used to be. If your parents care about their neighbors and maintaining social bonds in the community, then they will be much more concerned when their kid does something bad in the neighborhood, and the kid would be much  more aware of all the people who know his mom and dad and be far less likely to do something bad. We don't have that as much as we once did. The culture and the community just simply acting as a culture was a strong deterrent to crime. So today we might think "well he should just have to pay her" but that doesn't solve the issue, it doesn't magically bring people around the woman to support her which is far more healing, it just throws money at her.A lot of rules and laws in the Bible (and by the way, this is a not the rule that is supposed to be applied today, this was a rule during a very trying time for the Israelites) meant to combat the ways of the world at the time, they didn't necessarily directly reflect what God believes or doesn't believe. Critics often unfairly judge the laws they see in the Bible and when they don't see the rapist thrown in prison they then say "Well God is okay with rape." This was a group more or less on the run, they couldn't build prisons. Couldn't they have killed the rapist? Maybe, but that would leave them without a man to help defend them if necessary. It was a different time, it wasn't like today.For a modern day example of a practice that doesn't quite directly reflect the spirit of what we believe: we still employ affirmative action to help minorities. Now the idea of that kind of law is that it eventually won't be necessary... but if you pulled affirmative action out of context, you could read it that the culture thinks black people are inferior and need help, you could even read it and think that our culture felt they were better and deserved more positions (again, it might look this way if you were to pull the law out of context and read it as someone who is completely unfamiliar with Western Civilization). That is not what the law was designed to be. This culture believes that all people are equal under the law... does affirmative action directly reflect that? Not really, not when you pull it out of context. You have to understand that affirmative action was designed at a time when our culture was attempting to bring more minorities into the fold and so we enacted practices to help them do so.So to answer your question, the world saw unmarried women who were not virgins as undesirable. This view was not of God, it was of the world, but God saw that this is an idea that has bled into even the culture of His own people. While the Israelites had their own culture, kind of like Black culture today, it wasn't purely their own... because of slavery and other reasons the Israelites adopted customs and beliefs from other cultures. Right after being saved from slavery in Egypt, they were worshiping a golden calf, that wasn't from their own culture, that came from elsewhere and they adopted it. So this idea that unmarried non-virgin women were worthless, was an idea God was helping fight against.A married woman had more legal protections, more claims to property, and a better status in the culture. It lifted her out of the horrible position in which she was put. It was a legal status that protected her, not a prison sentence to live with an abusive person the rest of her life. Again, the culture would protect the woman from this man, and they would castigate the man away. He would live and shame, and she would be respected as a married woman. Marriage was much different then, it was far more transactional than it is today. Love existed obviously, but that was lower on the priorities than it is today.Anyway, to go back to affirmative action, you have this practice that was beneficial and actually very helpful in maintaining order and equity in the culture given the circumstances of the culture at the time. We are now coming to a time when it seems affirmative action has done all it really can and is arguably now hurting equity in the culture. Whatever you believe about affirmative action, it shouldn't be necessary one day when the culture changes. Most laws we have are only necessary given the circumstances of our culture. If we all drove safely, we wouldn't need speeding laws... we might actually stop needing them if self-driving cars become standard. This old rule about rape is obviously no longer necessary. Most of the world does not care as much about virginity nor about a woman being single, so legally marrying a woman to her rapist as a means of protecting her is not at all necessary. Yet we do still have laws that do similar things. A woman might sue her rapist for damages, that would ensure that she can sustain herself despite the damage done by the rapist... it achieves what the ancient marriage law achieved. When a husband is unfaithful, there still exists alimony. That similarly protects the now unmarried woman by ensuring she has money to live a life she had planned to live with her former husband. Oh right, as if that wasn't what you were implying. That's a cowardly move on your part. How pathetic. Be a better person. Excuse me? Am I justifying rape at all? Am I saying it is okay at all? Please tell me where you find that it is okay to accuse someone of being okay with rape.You are dishonest, and that is a vile thing to do. You misunderstand and so you dismiss and call the person who said a supporter of rape.Fucking disgusting, you should be ashamed of yourself. The reason for this is not as weird as seems because it is taken out of context. The marriage was a legal means of forcing the rapist to pay for the wife's care. The community at large would ensure the woman wouldn't have to be afraid, she didn't have to live with the dude or something. A woman who was not a virgin and unmarried was looked at as a really bad thing all over the ancient world, this was a means of ensuring a woman who found herself in such a position through no fault of her own was actually protected and taken care of.It wasn't like some kind of villainous act where the rapist won his "prize" through rape. This was a punishment for the man and a means of welfare for the woman. You guys realize that the internet doesn't magically make you more productive person, right?Further, the competition we have seen in the market has made our options better.Also, if a state or a municipality wishes to offer free internet to their people, there is nothing stopping them short of a local vote of some kind be it among the representatives or a propositional vote. There is no need to make this a federal issue.There are reasons poorer people are poor, many of them have to do with bad habits. For those who do not have internet access at home, there are literally hundreds of options, there are public buildings, coffee shops, even supermarkets have free wifi these days. Why do we need to give more power to the federal government when they pretty much always do a bad job anyways? This doesn't even solve the problems with poverty.The biggeat predictors of poverty have nothing to do with internet access. If you finish high school, you wait to have kids until you are married, and if you don't take long breaks in employment for bad reasons, then your chances of falling into poverty fall dramatically. Those are the keys. Forgive us, most comments phrased as you put it are sarcastically written by non-conservatives. Unfortunately it leads to us being a bit less trusting than perhaps we should. There is a wonderful but counterintuitive aspect of life and love that i didn't learn until far later than I should have: love starts before you find it. I used to think love would come and then i'd have the support I need to conquer (edit: I can't believe that in a sub about writing I used concur instead of conquer) the world. But what happens first is you start to build a life a love interest might want to be part of. I started putting my career first and looking into my own place, Istarted learning to cook more, I started being dissatisfied with just existing and started pushing for more... and I did it for me, for my contentment and joy, but I also hoped it might make me more confident with women. It did, but i also just felt better and was freer to do things I enjoyed. Soon I found someone. That one didn't last but I had far more confidence and I had my own life that I built and could focus on. I have recently found someone I am very much in love with but we are in the very very beginning stages of something. Anyway, my point is that building a life for yourself and also working to improve whatever life you have now, whether that means finding a better job or just pursuing your interests, whether it means finding a new place or fixing up the one you have... whatever it is, you will start feeling that there are so many possibilities.From there you might find love. For me, I found comfort in God. I started praying and adding a regular church group into my life... this helped me a ton. You can do it without doing what I did, but I think it is the best way... just somethjng to consider. I just think suicide is the worst option and I hope you know that. Anyway, your poem achieves it's intention, you convey the pain and isolation of someone toying with the terrible idea of suicide.I would suggest more imagery though.  Show people how you feel, don't tell them. The persona feels alone, why not use a metaphor to show it rather than just telling us. "I am a shadow on the sidewalk that never stands to touch the soft skin of love." The reader inserts the emotion that you made them feel by making them imagine it and feel it themselves. When you just tell us how you feel then we might sympathize but we don't really feel like you do. Try to make us feel like you, don't try and make us pity you. I don't want to pity you, I want to know you and how you see the world. I always forget how big a 50cal is. The free market and capitalism have pulled billions out of poverty. So yes.Policies of the left have led to a massive uptick in single parent households that have crippled poor mothers and have stifled their children. Truth can be divisive. The problem is when shallow things and lies are made divisive. If something true is divisive, that is the price of stating the truth. When people artificially make things divisive, that is a huge problem. The deep left has done that in spades while the moderate democrats have been left in the lurch. Just for clarification, the impeachment process is political. You act as if the House Democrats were completely impartial in this decision while Nancy smiled maniacally over the signing of the articles despite acting like this should be a somber event. What he was talking about are the regulations about new faucets, toilets, and dishwashers which limit the use of water for environmental reasons. These products were forced on the people despite many of them not working very well and they were all forced on us in the name of preserving the environment.Allowing the free market to work would be a much better way to reduce water consumption. Toilet manufacturers would narrow in on a model that uses less water and thus costs less to operate while also being effective. This has been happening since the toilet was invented, so people concerned with the cost of the water that they use in their homes would naturally buy toilets that use less water... so long as the toilet is effective.The government forced regulations that have rendered many toilets ineffective, so people end up having to flush more than once. Or the faucets that barely even drip, people end up having to increase their time washing their hands, then they get frustrated that it's taking so long and then they don't wash as effectively.It's better to let the market decide the standards rather than the government. I think both assertions are faulty. Your first assertion forgets the basic principle of supply and demand. Less population means less demand means prices for commodities go down. There is far more to consider, but I think that alone should temper some fears about lowering populations.Ecologically, higher populations have already seen a pattern of reduced environmental impact. The more populace an area, the more voices complaining about bad environmental practices. Not only that, but innovation is quickly leading to less and less environmental impact. If we can use technology to provide enough drinking water for everyone with minimal impact on the environment, then lakes and rivers and such will flow uninpeded... and we have that technology today. There is technology today thar solves most of rhe problems with an increasing population, it is just a matter of them becoming fiscally viable to implement. The cost of a desalination plant is great, but it essentially is creating a manmade river the empties right into our water infrastructure.So I think we can allay many of our fears for the future so long as we all chill out and not let our system collapse duento extreme unrest or something. Just for perspective, though, before the French Revolution the problems were that the anger and frustration with the way wealth was spread out was due to the fact that poorest people paid for the richest people's luxorious lifestyles through taxes. The tax burden of the poorest people was immense, and while the leadership wasn't as bad as portrayed in most history classes, the poor were far more justified in their anger.Today, the wealthiest pay the highest tax burdens in the west and the poorest of us pay almost nothing by comparison. Not only that, but the wealthy are not wealthy due to taxing the middle class and poor, they are wealthy because they provided goods and services to the masses (or invested in companies that do). And those goods and services have better our lives in so many ways.The money Bill Gates, Tim Cook, and Elon Musk have amassed was not built by taking our money, it was amassed providing us opportunities to buy products that have bettered our lives when we bought them. Jay Z just got you to buy albums. You didn't have to buy any of these things, they weren't taxes. You chose to give all these people your money unlike the people before the French Revolution who had to pay taxes.Are there issues in this system? Sure. Companies looking for the cheapest labor will often find it in lands where the people are abused and vulnerable. But if you own an Apple product, you are responsible for that, too. The thing is that the people most responsible for that are the leaders in the countries where those kinds of conditions are allowed.And if billionaires run all the countries, then why don't we have sweat shops in the US? Wouldn't it be cheaper to make Apple products here instead of shipping components and finished products all over the place? Shouldn't they have the sway to make that happen?Nope, billionaires are evil.EDIT: typo Uh, you're kind of being a jerk and you are defending someone who was being a jerk. I put 2 and 2 together and just figured maybe you are the same person :)Have a great day. Did you jump an an alt account to write this? >Then you might say, ‚Äúwell if there is corruption/incompetence then trump shouldn‚Äôt be sending aid‚ÄùNever said that, why assume my argument?>maybe it‚Äôs possible that 1) trump didn‚Äôt send enough aidMany things are possible. Aliens could have stolen the aid; that is also possible. This is a reach to try to legitimize the original issue with Trump. Not only that, but this isn't even the first story about aid that was just kept stored in a warehouse, it's just the first one reddit actually listened to. There were stories about this going back to just after it happened.More aid was sent than you all thought, it was clearly hidden for some kind of corrupt means. Whether it was entirely enough or not is immaterial. You folks blamed Trump for all this yet it turns out it wasn't his fault. Stop trying to reach to justify the initial claim that is now clearly false. Lol, Rochester is a nice area and is consistently voted one of the nicest places to live. You have resorted to ad hominem attacks, which destroys your credibility. And then you make attacks on my home town? Again, it hurts your credibility... It's also silly, and according to most measures, it is wrong.https://13wham.com/news/local/report-rochester-one-of-20-best-places-to-live-in-usThere you goHave a great rest of your weekend! Um because there were two wrongs here. You are acting as if I am ignoring one. I am not, I hope PR gets its act together. But you are ignoring a wrong you simply do not want to admit happened. Trump was falsely accused of not helping when it was the local government who fucked up.You know, in solving these issues, it is important to know where the fuck up happened. So Trump is relevant here. He is not the one who fucked up. Now we can narrow down who did.Take care. because anyone can comment on any comment and your comment was dumb. And you have lost all credibility as an arguer. It was a quip to make a point.Try being an honest person. No one said it matters to him or to anyone else. But you should admit when you're wrong instead of digging your heels in. And you are avoiding it, why? Because of the convenient red herring that we should be upset about it?Yeah, we should be upset about it, it's sucks. We should also be upset about the fact this was pinned on Trump dishonestly.It turns out people can be upset about 2 things at once. Selective memory, I guess. No, that is dishonest. Just making a point. Sure seems like this was an attempt at either corruption of local officials, or maybe even an attempt to make Trump look bad. You don't have to like the guy, but you should be disgusted when the media spins something to make the public feel a certain way that isn't accurate.Nice try though. Remember when everyone here was on Trump's case for not sending aid there? Anyone going to apologize? Yeah, it really is all of reddit except for the explicitly right leaning subs, and even those get overrun if the mods don't take a pretty hard stance and drop the ban hammer.I was in my home town's sub and whenever they bring up politics or social issues of any kind, it almost immediately becomes a leftist circle jerk. There was a cop in our town who briefly hit or put his hand on the suspect's neck. Obviously this is wrong. Like no shit, cops should never do that. But the number of people who just immediately made the cop out to be an inhuman monster before they even heard the whole story was astonishing.So I chimed in and essentially said "hey, could we maybe not make this cop out to be a monster. I mean yeah, it he could be a terrible cop, but he could also be a good guy who just lost his mother and the suspect (who almost assuredly did *something* warranting an arrest) probably said something really nasty. It doesn't make the behavior acceptable, but it might make us consider that he shouldn't jut be fired and prosecuted or something."Everyone shit on this including a couple instigators who always argue dishonestly. They deliberately claimed I was excusing the behavior despite clearly saying it was wrong.Anyway, it's always this way in that sub. I messaged the mods just to ask them if they would expand their very mininal rules to incude more personal attacks (right now they pretty much only remove comments without a ban if one user calls another user a "faggot" or something). They of course declined saying that we know the risk when we jump into the conversation... and that is true I suppose, but you could at least comment and stand for common decency. I consider falsely accusing someone of siding with police brutality as a "personal attack" but that's none of my business.Anyway, I think a lot of left leaning moderatora are somewhat aware of is that if they crack down on dishonesty and on incivility that a lot of the leftist mob power collapses and that it opens up more conservative views to be honestly discussed... I don't think they are entirely conscious of this, but there is a fear that other opinions may rise to the top.Like if r/politics moderators actually moderated fairly,  good arguments to support Donald Trump when he is right might convince more people that he's not evil, not perfect, but not evil. The moderators and the main user base do not want that and are afraid of it. So they act out in ways that cripple discussion. I wish they would pull from the extensive Star Wars collection of books. The Darth Plagueus story is a really interesting one that would delve into the force, it would look at Palpatine's rise, and woild offer an alternative look at some of the events of Episode 1.That's what Abrams should have done, but instead they crafted something that pulled a little bit from the novels but really just sort of made a trashy conclusion that doesn't make sense in the context of what the Force really is and what the Jedi are. This isn't exactly true. People act like baking is an exact science, and if you want perfect consistency every time then I suppose it becomes that way.  But most cooking is that way, too. Baking is experimental as well, you just need to know where you can improvise and take those chances... you can't just add salt to the final product if it's missing some... though actually sometimes you can.The thing with baking is that the tradition of it is sruck on these definitions of various products and those definitions largely relate to consistency. So we know a pastry crust has a general consistency, but I might want it breadier for my application, I might want it cakier... the thing is, if I want a pastry crust but I make it too cakey, it's looked at as a mistake in a pie, but the product might be really good, just more suitable in another application.Anyway, the point is that the experiments in baking can't be as easily tweaked in the moment, and so you can't always rescue an experiment gone wrong the way you could tweak a stir fry or add some lemon juice to save another dish. I listen to pretty much anything Counting Crows and the first two Bon Iver albums. No, he's a selfish dick. I said he is "almost comically stupid". His whole plan is stupid and reckless, the show just happens to treat it as a drama rather than a comedy. The show itself has many elements of comedy that they twist into drama. Re-watch the episode where they kill the dude in the basement and have to figure out how to get rid of the body, so they decide to dissolve it. Comedy ensues, except it's shot in a way where most of the comedy is lost... but it's all typical comedy sitcom writing at that point with White being the straight man and Pinkman is the bumbling idiot. It was basically an episode of sitcom, but darker. Here you go again with a dishonest argument by assuming my position as the worst you could possibly think of. You are a troll.Did I say it would *ever* be acceptable? The details may help us see that some leniency in punishment is warranted.You are such a dishonest arguer. Lol good lord dude. You argue dishonestly and I clarified my point. I don't think he should lose his job without knowing further information. Again, that's the whole point of my argument and you should, as a reasonable person and teacher, take my point with the caveat (which I made clear elsewhere) that with more information maybe he should be fired maybe he shouldn't.Rethink your teaching career. You are arguing against the point that waiting to pass judgment until more information is discovered is a good thing. You should also be teaching that dishonestly cherry picking without looking at the whole of an argument is a dishonest, bad faith means of arguing.As a teacher you should know that.Be better. Oh you know, that one with no troops on the ground or jets in the air. It's one of those non-war wars... it's like sugar free Jello. All I have been advocating this entire time is that we don't rush to judgment. Please find fault in that sentiment. Please.Secondly, if you are a high school teacher then you should be illustrating a higher level of decorum than what you have illustrated here... but that's none of my business.And again, did I say he shouldn't be punished? No. The whole point which you all seem to miss, is that this whole sub made him out to be a monster without knowing the situation. You (plural) will forgive criminals, but not a cop. And again, you were not there, you do not know what was said nor the situation leading up to it. I never once said he shouldn't lose his job, I never indicated anything about what I thought the punishment should or shouldn't be EXCEPT that we should not rush to judgment and to judge the situation with the sober minds of people who have waited for the facts.Please illustrate more decorum when representing our kids. Because she is indoctrinated by them. In this case the opinions aren't opposing, they just don't sound good to them when put succinctly... because they aren't good. He never admitted to sexual assault. You are mistaken and twisting what admission and assault means. Anderson Cooper called it an admission of assault and you guys ran with it. But women who go after rich men tend to consent to that kind of behavior. It's sleazy but not assault.The rest of your argument is bogus, too. There are tons of horrible people on the left but you think only the right has bad people.If you think that then there is little hope.Edit: typo Most catholics lean pretty left, dude. You should try again. You are reaching to justify your hate.Edit: from Pew: https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/religious-tradition/catholic/party-affiliation/Catholics are majority Democrat. And boyscouts? They've been pushing left for decades, they let women and atheists in now and they are the boyscouts a purportedly a Christian group for, shocker, boys. I read a disgusting top comment on a thread in r/worldnews that complained about the possibility of the toppling of the Iranian regime being a bad thing because Trump will get credit for it.It turns out he would deserve some credit for it because he emboldened the people by standing up to the regime simply by defending our own people and then encouraging the protesters in Iran.The victory would belong to the Iranian people, but Trump ought to be appreciated as helping them find their courage.Trump also happens to deserve some of the credit for this anchor standing up to the Iranian regime. Knowing the steongest economy and the strongest military power in the world believes in yout people is an influence that is immeasurable. This so trashy. Democrats are just as guilty of this crap but you present all this as if Republicans are all evil.Virtually all of Hollywood is Democrat and they are responsible for the need for a #metoo. And if you want politicians, how about Clinton and Weiner?Be reasonable. I think this is true to an extent, and I'm not going to say that one era of any art is better than another, but I also think objectively bad trends can pervade as a trend within an "era" (I use quotation marks because it's probably better in comedy to say generation).Sometimes these trends are good to start but then we kind of collectively beat the dead horse. And example to comedy (though not stand-up) is the oafish, moronic father trope sort of set into motion by The Simpsons. There had long been kinda dumb actions of a father type that lended well to the comedy and stupid behaviors in comedy has always been funny, but the idea of an irredeemably stupid and selfish father is a trend that happened around The Simpsons (which may have been started by the show) that has hurt the quality of the show. The trend garners laughs but also is rather tired.Homer was always kind of stupid with flashes of brilliance but he also had a heart. Somewhere around season 10 most of that heart was gone and he was pretty much just a self-involved asshole instead of the flawed and stupid father he once was. The heartful moments he had become less and less authentic and Homer became more and more of a jerk.So now we have Family Guy with Peter Griffin in a show that relies heavily on what I call "jump laughs" and "tantric laughs". A "jump laugh" would be when you toss in a non-sequitor, especially with a reference most people don't even get... the Donnie Most bit from early Family Guy is an example. It leads to a laugh, which is a success no matter how you measure it, but the audience doesn't fully get it. And "tantric laughs" are those laughs that come from a bit that goes on forever, relying on the sort of discomfort of the joke not finally resolving. The rather famous bit of Peter falling and hurting his knee and then wincing in pain for about a full minute is an example of this, or his random fights with a giant chicken. But within all of this is a profoundly stupid, selfish man who usually seems to hate his kids.South Park I think more masterfully uses this trope. It doesn't rely so heavily on the stupid father and it is able to craft a more complex narrative because it doesn't rely so much on the cheaper laughs. It also tends to make society out to be stupid with kids being competent while society, often led by a character like Stan Marsh, acts in supreme stupidity.Anyway, the supremely stupid father figure is a trope that really codified itself in the 90s. Again, there were oafish father types before them, but they had the common sense and folkish wisdom that Homer, Stan, and Peter did not.Anyway, the point is that these shows all started in about a 10 year stretch and helped strengthen this trend. Then you get shows like The Office with Michael Scott (or David Brent) as the supremely stupid office father figure. You get Malcolm in the Middle's Hal. You get Two and a Half Men with a sort of dual father, both of whom are selfish and stupid. You get Arrested Development (which is on a whole separate level but still utilizes this trope in a more masterful way... like South Park, the stupidest father figure -Tobias- is not the central character). You get Modern Family's Phil who is stupid. And you get fathers outside of comedy that are just kinda dicks without heavily leaning into the comedy. This is all sort of exemplified in Walter White, who is almost a comedically stupid father if he wasn't seething with anger deep down... the whole show is kind of just an extended episode of Homer Simpson getting cancer and realizing he needed to make money somehow.Anyway, my point is that if you come in on the end of this trend, it is a tired cliche that has lost a lot of it's original appeal. So you have people just developing their comedic tastes who aren't that into this now rather old trend and are looking for newer trends, and you have the generation who saw this as the new trend sort of holding onto it despite its becoming a tired cliche.And then you have folks that kind of exist beyond the generational trappings... it doesn't mean they are better than anyone, they just have a different perspective. These people are like Ebert who may indeed rightly be criticizing the comedy scene at the time, which pisses off the early adopters of the now old trend, while seeming out of touch with the people looking for the next trend. Or maybe you are misunderstanding or misinterpretting what he has said and they actually get it. >One incident of losing your cool and getting physical is enough to say you shouldn't have this job.Only the Sith deal in absolutes. But again, none of this at all addresses my point.None of it.My point is that people are treating this person as though he is an absolute monster, and that is disgusting. The dude clearly made a mistake. Don't condemn him as a monster for that... fine, take is job if you think it necessary. I don't but you apparently have a much stricter standard. I would like to know the situation before I condemn him. You have been dishonest by making the argument about something I never claimed it was about.If he has a history of it, sure, fuck him. EDIT And if the incident was clearly all instigated by him, fuck him, too. END EDIT But until you know for sure and you are willing to just assume the worst, then you are part of a vile and scary mob. You all would seemingly have this man's head. It undermines the policing we need. You should be ashamed. You are acting as if I am denying that they should be held to higher standards. That doesn't mean they don't make understandable mistakes... and THAT doesn't mean that they don't also sometimes make completely terrible mistakes that ought to result in prison. I have not denied any of that even once, I have not said he shouldn't be punished once. All I have done is say that people shouldn't just assume the worst of this individual.A guy calls you a pussy... you ignore it. He keeps calling you a pussy, and then he says "fuck your mother", you ignore it. Then he tells you, "I hope your mother gets cancer and dies!" Yeah, you should obviously still ignore and not react, but who is the dick in the situation? The guy who is goading you, or you who might against your better judgment, snap at that last comment?The sub is acting like the asshole is you in this scenario... All I'm saying is that you shouldn't have hit the guy, but let's remember who you are dealing with. It doesn't excuse you hitting the guy, but it sure puts it in the proper context. I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt before I give the dickhead who picked the fight... why? Because that is a more reasonable stance. Legally, the dickhead deserves a fair trial and is innocent until proven guilty had he done anything wrong, but he was also picking a fight with you with the purpose of goading you into a reaction. I'm going to be more sympathetic to you for trying to keep calm and failing than to the guy who was playing with fire and egging you on even though it is true true you shouldn't have punched him at all. Thank you! I considered making it a bit more of a narrative, but as I was doing it, I kept coming across as a bit of a passive wuss whose shtick is basically just "Please let me love you!" haha. So I stuck with just a sort of snapshot this time around so as not to completely emasculate myself. By the way. I appreciate your more pleasant response as opposed to most of the rest i have seen. Do you know how you are going to handle every situation in life before you are in it?Again, we don't know the circumstances of this. He was wrong and should be punished, but that punishment should fit the offense which requires that we know details we are not privy to. And our opinion of him should fit the details, which again, we are not yet privy to.If he was having a really off day and the suspect said something nasty enough and goaded him enough, it doesn't mean we should excuse what he did, it doesn't mean he shouldn't be punished, but it does mean that some leniency mignt be appropriate in his punishment or even just how we treat the man after the fact.Everyone here is turning this into this vitriolic rant against cops in general and we don't even know the details that led to it. The dude clearly made a mistake, if it is a repeated issue, then can him and charge him... if it was a one time thing and he is going through something, why make him out yo he a monster? Again, you are being dishonest. I have said his behavior was unacceptable and that he should be punished. That is not excusing his behavior. You are lying or you have a fundamental misunderstanding of what making excuses means.All I did say is that we shouldn't judge him as if he is an irredeemable monster. You are always dishonest with arguments you disagree with. You are consistently dishonest arguer and you should try to be better. No shit he doesn't get to escalate. But when people like you just poke and prod and try to hit a nerve, sometimes mistakes will be made in the heat of the moment.You are acting like a child. You mean to his awesome one? Someone learned about nazis and now that's all he sees. Did i excuse his behavior as acceptable? No. You are being dishonest. You don't know what his first reaction was. You are assuming everything off a clip you saw with no additional info.All I said was maybe we shouldn't assume the worst of this cop. I'm sorry I need more information before I utterly condemn a man as human garbage like the rest of you. That is dishonest. I'd expect no less from you. This id you MO. Your view is skewed to an extreme cynicism that undermines the rule of law. You act as if there is some kind of magical force that can handle all of this without any mistakes. Are you willing? Please do a better job. You have no clue what these cops see everyday and they see hate from people like you who assume their intent and what they stand for.We give cops an impossible task and then shit on them when they fail... but what's worse is that we blame them when other people do wrong, we give those who commit crimes more of the benefit of the doubt than the cops who deal with them.It is not a cop out at all and you calling it that is dishonest. You are saying it is a cop out not to take the whole picture into account? I should just hate this man when I know all of us have faced situations where following the rules was being tested to an extreme?I never said he shouldn't be punished  not that he should be excused... but this vitriolic hate for him is fucking disgusting and your undermining of the polive is even worse. While we do have to hold cops to a high standard, I just hope people understand how nasty people can get. I'm not excusing the cop at all, but they are dealing with people who might be very angry and say just about the worst possible thing they can think of, and they might do that right after you just tried to help them.You make it sound like the easiest thing in the world. Imagine just losing your mother or something and a little shithead who is pissed at you for arresting them for something they obviously did wrong. You just tried to help them somehow, maybe it was a minor infraction and you were only going to give them a warning... and he turns around calling you a bitch and saying he hopes your mother dies. And  you let it slide the first time, but the guy sees it affects you they keep at it. Now try not to hit him... you should be able to restrain yourself, but in the moment? Damn would it be nice...Now according to WROC 8 this morning, they say he was responding to a domestic violence call. So on top of everything I just said, just imagine this total piece of shit just hit his wife or girlfriend, you go in, but because you didn't actually see him hit her and because she refuses to press charges, you have to just let this guy go. You all know he just beat his girlfriend, but you can't do anything about it. Then you take him aside and talk with him, and that whole situation plays out as it did. Now, your mother who just passed also happened to be abused by your father or her boyfriend when you were growing up...Try not to hit the guy.Again, not excusing the cop but we should at least be judging him soberly. Again, there is no valid reason for the cop to hit this guy, but there are a ton of bad ones. Those just don't magically disappear because there is a strict rule about how cops have to handle things. There is no valid reason to hit the guy, it shouldn't have happened... but could we maybe not judge the guy to be a horrible monster or a gang member?Gangs don't give a shit about rules and they don't enforce the law nor do they have protect people, even those they might hate. That is an incredibly dishonest comparison.Cops are not perfect, they are people trying to do something society needs them to do, seeing horrible things that we don't have to... and we sit here pretending like "oh just ignore it" is the easiest thing in the world. You are very welcome! :) Keep up the great work. This is lovely. Your imagery is just wonderful. The surrealism of what it initially conjures in my mind speaks to me in ways I really miss in the poetry I often read these days. Modern poetry is often lacking imagery, so to see it so richly included in this poem is great.Unless I am gravely mistaken, you masterfully address death in a dreamy, contemplative way. This friend, or child, or lover of Mary dreams to cope, while the hunter leaves us in a dream.So this is where I stopped and read your response below about Mary Oliver passing and her book *Blue Horses*, which I have not read before. So the allusion you make to her work are lost on me, I'm not sure I want to understand the allusion more fully because what this poem conjured without knowing the context was just lovely... in the first part especially.The image of the hunter in the second part offers an interesting contrast and pulls the reader from this almost child-like wonder about where people go when they die into this image of real death.I love the line "as I climb into the belly of the wind"... my god.And I love how you invoke the name of flowers in this, I miss that so much in poetry. I love thinking about how people knew so much more of the names of flowers and trees back not so long ago.The only note I could possibly give is not really a note because I don't know how else you could end it. The line "to dream of another way home." has a slightly cliche sound to it. I have written poems that end in a similar way with a dream that implies the subject or the persona is going down a concrete path yet, in their wonder, there is a sort of hope that something magic will intervene. It has this quality of an ellipse, you know? As if the poem trails off while also being final.Anyway, my point is that it is gorgeous and a lovely way for this poem to end... I am merely saying that it is a semi-common convention. And it really works here, so I see no need to defy convention in this case.... and now I'm babbling.AHH I just remembered what the first part kind of reminded me of. There's this movie with Robin Williams from the 90's: *What Dreams May Come*. The imagery in part I gave off the vibe I got from that movie... but they were entirely their own.I'm sorry, I'm gushing over this. It's lovely.EDIT: typos First of all, please don't forget if you are still taking them :) I know the struggle and the thoughts.Secondly, I love the how you play with words (morning turns to mourning) and the dichotomies you use (mind/body, prisoner/guard). They add to the sense of discordant emotions while at the same to rendering a sort of even keel... they don't jar the reader, they actually make the poem stable and it allows the reader to sense the monotony of depressive feelings.One note I would have is that you tread the line between that sort of cliche of depression poetry and something much more profound. I don't mean to say you have crafted a cliche at all, but to further remove your work from that kind of sense, focus on imagery more rather than the emotion... or maybe be more assertive.For instance, you say "I think" 4 times in the poem. I love repetition, but sometimes it clutters a bit. The second to last stanza is one of dichotomies your sort of play with, you line up "need" and "have" in a way that (not really a dichotomy but certainly a comparison of possession). Anyway, you say "I think" three times there. I was just playing around with it and tried this "The days I forget my pills,/I smile;/maybe I don't need them./Maybe emotions are stupid./Maybe I just don't have them."In academic writing you don't say "I think X" you just say "X". The reader assumes you are merely stating an idea. Obviously this isn't academic writing, but a similar assumption applies.Anyway, repetition is really nice in that stanza. It's just a thought on how to play with it. The old Springfield tire fire....yeah, don't listen to me. You can pull from something awesome and adapt it and make it suck. This is pretty common in Hollywood. If you think your view is unbiased, then you are part of the problem. It does make sense that the president has some powers that allow us to move faster than getting congress all together to agree to kill Bin Laden or something. War moves quicker than it did in the past and we are dealing with enemies that more and more do not follow the conventions of war. Exactly what the limits should be, I do not know.But killing Suleimeni (sp?) was the right thing to do. A common sense policy of deterrence works. We see this is the case because Iran foolishly responded but pulled their punches because they knew they would be destroyed if they hit any of our people. They acted like the victims, they lashed out like children, but they pulled their punches. They hit Iraqi bases, they didn't even hit American bases, but this allowed them to save face and slink back home knowing they would be destroyed if they pushed any more than that.This is how you deal with bullies, you let them talk, let them act tough, but you set clear boundaries... you don't give them money hoping they will just be nicer. Obama gave them money, and they used it to buy weapons that they then used to hit Iraqi bases. The Democrats want to disrupt this common sense approach for some reason in favor of ones that they seem to think will help countries like Iran grow up. When you spare the rod you spoil the child; when you fail to assert boundaries, the boundaries you want will not be respected... boundaries like not attacking our embassies, boundaries like not killing Americans, boundaries like not giving aid to the terrorists who perpetrated 9/11. Suleimeni did all of those things. I was waiting for this to happen. I was hoping they would be better than that. What does the age have to do with it? If that is what dissuades you, then I'm afraid reason won't persuade you. I'm not going to defend the character of Chris Collins, but I think insider trading laws are silly and there are many reasons for this. Here are a couple opinion pieces that discuss reasons why these laws are silly:https://www.cnbc.com/id/100917279https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-insider-trading-should-be-legal-2011-05-17Most people don't know why insider trading laws really exist, they just trust that they are of benefit to us. If you have intellectual integrity, you ought to question the validity of such things. And I want Cuomo to leave office. He is trash. This is how you disagree with a fellow Republican while still following the 11th commandment, folks. I wish she'd cover herself more. It's not that we cannot comprehend these laws, we just don't know all the specifics.To go back to my US analogy, we can't save every person in the world we might want to help. There are rules of engagement. There are nations that are sovereign over themselves. The US could physically and logistically save a ton of people, but we don't... we haven't been into North Korea to free all those people from the terrible prison camps even though we have the power to do so. We have to work within the system of laws in which qe find ourselves and we also have to contend with the free will of sovereign nations like North Korea.This is true of the larger picture of God's creation. According to scripture, the model of God it describes is one thar has entrusted the sovereignty of Earth to Adam. God has given man rule over its own world.Now imagine a country in the middle east, one that was fully an ally of the US. Even as an ally, the US can't just intervene as it wants, it recognizes the sovereignty of that nation. If the ally asks for help and that request aligns with what the US stands for, then the US would likely help. If however thar ally asks us to do somethjng the US does not stand for, then the US must decline its ally's request.Now imagine the relations between the US and the ally become strained. Many of the people in that nation distrust the US for some reason, perhaps they wanted the US to help in some way that the US could not oblige. The politics change and the people no longer look at the US as an ally, they want the US military bases gone, they stop authorizing the US to perform military actions, etc. The US backs off because they can't just force their help on a nation that no longer wants it even if there are still many within that nation who do want the help of the US. We see this all over the Middle East today. We see this exact kind of dynamic all over the world with peole in hostile countries wanting our help but we are unable to do so unless certain factors are met (maybe that nation attacks us and now we can go in and fight back, thus allowing us also to help those people in need... maybe there is a civil war and those who like the US break away from the rest of rhe country). This is true of the world as well. Free will was necessary for humanity to be free and creation to be just (I can delve deeper on that, but for now just assume that is true). That freedom made man vulnerable and they chose to do something that allowed the enemy to take sovereignty away from man. So just like that ally that stopped being an ally to the US, the world stopped being an ally to God. Now God can't operate as freely as He would like because this is not His world to do as He likes. We do not know all the specific rules and laws, but we know God cannot/will not supercede our free will. We know that Earth was given to the enemy by the mistake of man. We do not know what exactly allows or prohibits God from intervening when there is suffering.But just like it not the US's fault for the choices of other countries, it is not God's fault when a parent stupidly leaves their child outside, alone by the pool. That was a free will choice by that person. It's called a trial, yes. That doesn't make it apolotical. Come be a conservative. Kinda like how we nabbed the whole "let's give rights to people of color" thing from them, too. Republicans also pushed for women's suffrage first, too. I would probably try to use that as a buffing wheel. Ok, then don't protest anything in public either. I don't want to hear your inane protests about anything.Or accept that free speech is healthy and learn to cope with messages you don't agree with. Or better yet, learn to engage people you don't agree with in a positive way. It's a political process, dude. It's not a trial like you think it is. Oh I know you weren't. I was mainly challenging it because there are lurkers who would jump on what you said not realizing you were just offering an interesting point to consider. I like the term "catalyst" for Trump, I've used it myself. I tend to go to the spiritual route because it is hard to explain where this movement really came from, why Trump chose this cycle to run, and how all the events led to him. I mean there are simple answers to why he chose to run, but the question of the timing of everything else seems almost miraculous.That said, the reactions are predictable... almost chemical or mathematical. So "catalyst" is perfectly apropos. That is certainly interesting, but nothing Trump has done could be likened to Genghis Kahn or Napoleon. Napoleon was a brutal warmonger who took over much of Europe, at his peak, he had control of most of it and killed millions through his wars and other means. Genghis Kahn was similar a similarly brutal person.Trump tweets stuff and stands up to bullies. I think the sort of muted comparison you draw here is not fair at all. Trump has killed terrorists who brutalized and/or killed many innocent people as well as having killed over 600 Americans and gave harbor to the 9/11 hijackers. Trump killed a man who helps commit horrible atrocities.This constant likening of Trump to your Hitlers and Napoleons and Kahns of history is such weak comparison. Trump is much more like the rough and tumble, abrasive, imperfect heroes of the past... he is more like the Churchills of history. I have always hated to think God sent somebody or something or that God used someone or something. It is rather convenient to say in validating what you believe should be. But the more I look at how the world responds to Trump and what he does, the more I think he is an answer to prayers. He was the perfect person to tap and put in this position to upset the apple cart. He didn't start this trend but he codified it, anchored it, and is now leading it.When you go against the prevailing winds, those who who go with them will go nuts. And that is exactly what is happening. Oh I do. But a lament losing a parting shot. The division sucks, but it is hard when the spirit we are against wants us to die. Like we could cut down some of our not-so-civil rhetoric (which began as a response to theirs), but they have to stop wishing us dead. The only ones that can really heal the division is them when they want us dead. Obviously not all or even most of them wish us, but a disturbing number do not speak up when others do... and a disturbing number half joke about older rightwingers types just needing to pass on to save us. Yeah, I wish you could accept and then block. But once you accept, you accept forever as far as I've seen. I just want to give a brief retort sometimes and then move on. It wasn't an assassination. So you are re-citing the same article that didn't actually prove what you claim it proved. You cite the NYtimes. I actually cited the UN list of war crimes but reject that.Talk about obstinant. They gave me a law they thought said what you claim, but did not. Again, show me the law. Please show me the international law that says so. I cited the UN. You cited nothing.Edit:typo You are denying the function and structure of what was done. I am not doing what you claim. That is not an honest distillation. But the short answer is yes. There is a long answer, but based on your question I don't think you'd give it a fair shake. You are speaking as if these laws are immutable rather than agreed upon by the governing council. My point is that shared sovereignty results in laws established that are agreed upon. They are standards that, just like here on earth, can be followed or not. So you are applying a standard of an immutable sort of law to a law that may be just like our own, which people choose to follow or not. That is why it isn't jiving for you.Don't forget that God gave sovereignty over Earth to Adam. Adam was the ruler of Earth, God trusted him to rule it hoping he would rule it righteously as God Himself would.You ask why God would allow a divine council that limits Him. Why did the US founding fathers choose to limit their power? Why did representatives of populous states choose to balance their power with the electoral college? There are many times in the founding of our laws where people gave up power to states believing it results in a better balance of powers that produces a more stable and just government.Ultimately, God still has all His power. The limits are only on how He can legally act within the creation, it doesn't actually limit Him. Not only that, but God is so powerful that even within these limits he has agreed to abide by, He can soundly dispatch the enemy.We know this is true because we know that had the enemy known that killing Jesus would achieve they wouldn't have moved on that plan. This also parallels what we saw in Jesus, that like God, Jesus limited himself by being only righteous. Had Jesus deviated, he wouldn't have been sufficient payment for our sins. That is power in being limited by righteousness.It is the shedding of unrighteousness that we restore sovereignty to where it belongs. That's a shame. They're missing out on that elementary school rush around 3:30pm every day. Republicans forced the issue. Because we have visitors who might not see the nuance, I want people to be careful here because they might see your point and maybe think that Republicans are to blame. Democrats put all the ingredients of this shit soup into the pot and then turned the heat on very low so no one would know how bad it actually will be. It would end with everyone knowing how bad it is with or without the Republicans, we just walked by and turned up the fire so now people are really smelling how gross the soup is, hopefully ensuring that everyone sees the chef really sucks at his job before they ruin the country. I think you missed the legal component. The programmer allegory is only sufficient in explaining why God couldn't just make a squared circle.The legality is more the crux of it and this is something I do not understand why people seem to ignore and it answers the incompetency issue you have. There are so many examples of legal actions and bindings in the Bible. They are tied to the spiritual and are often seen in ritualistic behavior that makes these laws seem somehow magical. But there are clearly very strict rules of engagement when it comes to the war going on.It is like the West's war on terror. While we are relegated to fight a war within the confines of the Geneva Convention among others (though we fail to abide by those rules perfectly), terrorists or supporters of terrorists will sign on to those rules but not follow them at all. The West is thus confined by the rules and ends up limited in the actions yhey can take, but that does not make the West incompetent. The United States could do a lot if it weren't for the rules, and as much as the world thinks otherwise at this moment, the West (including the United States) still does a pretty decent job of abiding by those rules of war.God would perfectly abide by those rules. We simply don't know all the rules because they haven't been shown to us entirely. But clearly they must exist because we know it is God's will that we all be healed but we are not all healed. It is God's desire that no one should die, but we do. There are clearly rules that stand in the way of God.On Earth as it is in heaven.It seems convenient but it's true. God has shared sovereignty with those below Him, this requires rules. Good job. You are reading intent into something without any evidence to support your claim. Yeah. It distracts from the point at hand. That's a red herring. It's a form of red herring. I don't know that this form has a specific name. You are flat wrong and complaining about the length of a comment to invalidate a point rather than actually addressing the point. Thst is a logical fallacy. Your tactics are dishonest. You are still reading into the comment. In a war, targets will be named and hit and some will have cultural significance. Further, if their military uses a cultural site as a hiding spot, they have thus made it a valid target.What you bring up is simply about not making a tit for tat hit. Meaning that if you attack us, we can't just destroy a museum or something. But if they are a valid military target because the enemy is using them somehow, then they become a valid target. He didn't. Read the rules on the UN site. You all read that into his comment. The UN laws stipulate that if you commit wanton destruction of buildings without a real, military reason, then that is a war crime. So you can't just go around blowing up any buildings you want for any reason just because you are at war, they have to have a military reason to be hit. I've posted the link to the UN rules below.https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/war-crimes.shtmlAnother stipulation is that you can't hit UN certified heritage sites. This is a list of very specific sites. These are sites that the UN deems worthy of some kind of historic, scientific, or cultural significance to the world. This isn't just a blanket rule against blowing up mosques or churches (as enemies might hide in such buildings and use them as staging areas to do bad things). If the enemy uses a museum as a staging area for military activities, it is a valid target because they made it one.Another rule is that you can't hit "civilian objects" which they clarify as non-military objectives. So you can't just hit a mall because you think it will demoralize the country. But when the military takes a civilian objective and uses it as a military base, it is no longer a civilian object. Again, this might include a culturally significant building.It also says you can't just cause a lot of damage to the natural environment or cause an inordinate loss of life unless there is valid military reason to do so. So if the enemy's military goes to hide in a beautiful piece of landscape that is culturally important, it becomes a valid place to hit.When you read the list, it says nothing about "culturally significant" sites being categorically off the table. If the enemy takes shelter in a culturally significant building, they have put it on the table. This is one of the reasons why these people are so evil, they hide in hospitals and schools... they will run into mosques. They endanger their own people by hiding in these places. The targets usually end up being valid targets but we don't want to hit hospitals because there are innocent people in them and because people would twist what happened and just say the US hit a hospital and have no regard for civilian life.I mean think about it. If Hitler himself was spotted by some soldiers on the ground going into the Reichstag, would  you just not go in there because it's culturally significant? No... you might not choose to bomb it, you might decide it is better to send soldiers in on foot, but it be like he ran to Safe and suddenly he can't be tagged.EDIT: fixed a clunky sentence. The title is dishonest. It presupposes the president indeed meant that he wanted to commit war crimes when a more reasonable explanation is that he was referring to valid targets that have cultural significance. For example, in the US, the White House would be a valid target an enemy nigbt try to hit. It is also very culturally significant. He was also laying it out nice and clear that if their military people deliberately go to hide in a mosque, that's on them.... it won't save them. Anyway, it presupposes the interpretation that is frankly an alarmist one, and that changes the story. The pentagon wasn't going against Trump, they were asserting that the rules of war will be fulfilled.The pentagon was clarifying, not defying. I think we miss the legality of creation. We define God so frequently with a sort of hybrid between the archetypical Christian view of God and the atheist strawman version of God. If we are to assert a Biblical description of God then we must include the legal components, many of which we do not fully understand. But there are implied as well aa explicit legal boundaries that both God and all His enemies follow (or the enemy are supposed to follow but do not). God appears to have a Divine Council, which means He shares His authority and does not actually act unilaterally in the spiritual realm, in the earthly realm,  authority was given to Adam, then lost. Authority is now contested because Jesus has asserted not only his lineage to rightfully rule, but has lived perfectly sinless and also paid his life in sacrifice for all of ours. This establishes some kind of renewed but not yet complete authority of man over earth.Anyway, my point is that the silence of God that we think we perceive sometimes (I would argue that we sometimes just miss God's actions) can be explained within the free will paradigm by defining God as the head, though limited authority, over the heavens. The sharing of authority, like a sort of democratic government, precludes God from acting in situations He would otherwise prevent. It would be similar to how the American presidency works. There are many actions he president could take that are illegal but that would help people of his country. If the president chosec to be perfectly righteous, he or she could not do any of those illegal acts because it would break the laws he is supposed to uphold. The president can't just imprison someone he fears will commit murder unless legal requirements are met,  and that is within his own country. There are also areas over which the president has no or very limited authority. These areas would be foreign countries. The president can airstrike certain targets of his own volition at times, but declaration of war requires permission of Congress.Say an Iranian wished to defect and join the US. We can't just send a military jet over and pick them up, the president doesn't really have the authority to do so despite this person pledging their heart to the US.Even with an actual US citizen in a foreign country, the president has little authority to just send troops into Iran, if say they broke Iranian law. The president could attempt to strike a deal or maybe apply some pressure on Iran, but he can't just send troops... and this is a fallible person. God is perfectly righteous, and if there are governing bodies and laws that are anything like the way our world works (and we know this must be the case to some degree as we know authority over earth was lost by Adam), then due to a combination of free will and of God's perfectly strict adherence to the law, there must be laws the preclude God from acting and preventing suffering. This model of God eliminates the need to even discuss a God that would or could make a circular square. I think that kind of change would fundamentally change physics which would pose a problem. In my view, God could do that, but not within this creation. Like a program on a computer, if I am the programmer, I have the power and the intelligence to make a fundamental change in the physics of the program. But I might have to scrap my whole program to do so because it changes so much. If I love the little ai beings in the first program i made, just starting over would be possible, but to the detriment of the ai beings OR it would just be an entirely new creation that the ai beings would be separate from. So the programmer is limited in his actions by the parameters of the program he created. If God is analagous to this, His knowledge and power are still unlimited except for in ways that would fundamentally change us and the creation in which we live. I would argue that it would not be righteous to make the change some how and simply adjust us and our understanding to this nearly changed creation but I'll leave that for now. The point is though that there is still no limit to God's power save for actions that are unrighteous... and those are self imposed limits.Again, with this model of God, while not as academically sounding as what I typically see here, I think it solves all the problems with the free will argument and alligns biblically. You don't even see how dishonest you are being. Please point out where I moved goalposts. I made secondary claims about your motives, yes, but the rest of the argument stands and you continuously ignore the valid points.You are a master of goal post shifting and don't even realize it. You really should take some time and learn to discuss honestly because I have never once seen you do so.Take care. He doesn't disagree. He used his constitutional authority. It is not a brand new objection, and raising an objection to a premise is not invalid because you objected to later on... that is dishonest, too.If you understand the purpose then you shouldn't characterize it as "paying for freedom" or however you put it. The purpose of innocent until proven guilty is not to make it illegal to hold people... You are still operating under a backwards premise.Someone accused of a crime must face the charged, to ensure they stay we hold them, if they can post bail then we allow them to leave the jail until their court date.You guys do the same thing with health insurance. Health insurance provides a service, your life is better because of health insurance. It is remarkably less expensive to have insurance and suffer a medical issue than to not have insurance and suffer one. They provide a service and yet people act like it's something else.Bail is a sign we prefer to trust people than to not trust them.So again, your paradigm has it backwards because you seem to think bail is a means to hold people down.The only change I would make is to assert more regular standards to bail, maybe accept certain forms of collateral that is not monetary.If the issue is that it unfairly burdens the poor, which I think is arguable at best, then make it more attainable, don't just abolish it.But i don't think you want a reasonable solution, you want to stand on your soapbox and claim everyone is wrong who disagrees with you.Now you will just shit on my solution and offer none yourself except that the proposed solution is sufficient because it fits your paradigm. Again, your paradigm is dishonest, you admit it is not accurate because you describe exactly what bail is supposed to do.>the rate at which defendants return to court remains high even without bail as an incentive.the rate is not everything. It is also the kind of crimes and the kinds of people who do not show up that is important. Also, again, that study is incredibly short and limited. There is hardly corroboration. So you want to take one of the biggest states in the country with one of the biggest prison populations and apply an untested strategy on it. Yet they are willing to attack civilians.... why do you act like this is somehow noble of the Iranians? I didn't say they did. You folks need to stop deliberately mischaracterizing what people say.It is dishonest and means you are not worth talking to. Your assessment of the paradigm is unfair and you pose it as a forgone conclusion when there are valid arguments for a bail system. So there is no discussing with you.Considering you know it is not actually a payment, it is collateral, you should know your catagorization of the paradigm is dishonest. Collateral is not payment despite us saying we "pay bail". It is not a quid-pro-quo but that is how you are describing it. In a quid-pro-quo, I get something and you get something. In bail, I hold something of yours and you come back for it. That is not payment. We are not doing a service to the accused.So again, your description of the paradigm is dishonest. It is collateral to ensure compliance.There can be no meeting of the minds if you can't call it what it is. So because one country has made mistakes but has also protected Jews, Muslims, Christians, atheists, etc., you are going to make America out to be the bad guy when virtually all Iran does is war crimes.Pretty much all countries have committed war crimes, the US attempts to abide by the rules. Iran doesn't even try. I'm going to side with the U.S. Interpret it at face value. You are interpretting by presupposing the utmost evil possible, which is insane considering the history of Iran is full of actual evil and vile acts. We are the good guys. This idea that were are the bad guys and the aggressors lacks awareness of history.The literally want Israel wiped off the map, and if that's not enough, they want all Jews dead. But when we fight back against their bullshit or when thr president says a word you choose to interpret in the worst way possible, then suddenly none of that matters.You end up defending Iran... it's Iran. They only do war crimes and you act like they're the victims. I didn't say that. That is dishonest. You all seem to be conflating "culturally significant" with the protected heritage sites or sites that are not protected but still taboo to strike.The point is this, in a war against the US, the White House would be a valid target. The White House also happens to be very significant to our culture. "Culturally significant" targets are often targetted in war.Most of the sites that are protected under international law have almost no strategic value. There is no point to attack them except to pour salt in the wound. Trump doesn't want to waste resources and commit war crimes. You are all reading far too much into this. By the way, war crimes are pretty much all Iran and Islamic extremists do.So you are mad at the president for tweeting something that you interpret might be a war crime, meanwhile, Iran and the people they support commit war crimes pretty much every day, including the dude who who we hit with a drone strike. fixed it. I was spit balling, dude. Sorry. I hope you aren't trying to invalidate the argument based on that alone... because that would be dishonest. Frankly, your correction makes this whole new law even stupider.>But what if they didn't commit a crime?If they didn't commit a crime the legal process still needs to work. That is the point of the trial, to determine if a crime was committed. You are acting as if it is common for people accused of crime to be completely innocent. Usually, when a person is arrested, they did something obvious and the trial is more a formality. The person was selling drugs but the trial determines they only can have them on possession, for example.You are committing the Worst Case logical fallacy, and that is what happens when someone who is actually innocent has to deal with bail. First, no one has to pay bail. But you also ask a question that the system is designed to prevent as if it is something new. You are objecting to bail because someone might be innocent... we assume they are all innocent. Only people presumed innocent pay bail.If these are your only objections, they are weak. ohh sorry. The 1983 Embassy bombing begs to differ. The 1984 United States Embassy Annex bombing begs to differ. The Hijacking of TWA flight 847 in 1985 begs to differ. Hahahaha! Well, I do that anyways. I never try to, it just happens. ~~9/11 begs to differ.~~ The 1983 Embassy bombing begs to differ. The 1984 United States Embassy Annex bombing begs to differ. The Hijacking of TWA flight 847 in 1985 begs to differ.Don't trust what they say ever, guys. I'm glad I'm more of a ~~classy~~ social drunk than a reckless one. I mean I have some stories from college, but none where I actually risked paralysis. Thank you! I hope some of the downvoters actually take some time to read. I'm willing to take the beating, I just hope it maybe makes some of the people here rethink their stance a bit. Yes, but he didn't say he was going to destroy UN Heritage sites. Culturally significant targets and UN Heritage Sites are not necessarily the same thing, and in war, most of those Heritage sites have little strategic value. Enemies would not gather at them or store things at them.The White House is a culturally significant target that an enemy of the US would want to hit. It is not a heritage site. The Twin Towers were culturally significant, they weren't on the list. Again, these Heritage sites are usually not strategic centers, rather they are often natural landmarks, remarkable structures, or some kind of scientifically relevant site like maybe a site with a lot of dinosaur fossils or something.[Here](https://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/us) is the list of US heritage sites. Notice how none of them are really strategically important and would not be a typical target in a war anyway. Notice the White House is not on that list despite it being one of the most culturally significant spots in the US. The Capitol Building, the Washington Monument, the NYSE. All of those are culturally significant but are also targets that an enemy would want to hit.The Brooklyn Bridge is on the tentative list for Heritage sites, that has some strategic value, but only in that it is usable infrastructure. The Hollywood sign is incredibly culturally significant, it's not on the list, neither is Mann's Chinese Theater. Those are crappy targets for an enemy to hit. An enemy attacking these targets would result in minimal casualties with almost no benefit to them. The same will be true for Heritage sites in Iran.[Here](http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/IR) are the heritage site in Iran.None of these are sites the US would want to strike. We want to stop the terrorism and the infrastructure of the terrorists.People are reading way too far into his comment. War is full of culturally significant targets that are not considered war crimes if hit.Lastly, not that this excuses war crimes at all, but [pretty much all Islamic terrorists do are considered war crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime). If you go down the list, Iran does basically all of those things. So I find it a little odd to be so concerned about someone who hasn't committed a war crime, merely tweeted something that some interpreted as possible war crimes, meanwhile a country that constantly commits war crimes or condones war crimes and has a general that committed war crimes is being defended by our own people.It's really strange. Bail jumping is a low enough level crime that they included it I guess. The crime still exists, they just can't be held on bail for it. So it sounds like a loop hole but I'm not sure it is. It's certainly weird though. It sort of eliminates that as a crime because no one can skip bail if they are released without it. You have to be accused of rape or murder basically to even be given bail now. If you pay your bail, skip out on it, once they catch you I imagine the judge would deem you a flight risk, so the bail skipping araignment would happen while you're now sitting in the system.I think ultimately all this does is make the court system even slower. Even if the increase in crime as a result somehow stays even (and i would be very curious to take a deeper look at the stats they used), then it still gunks up the system more.The [Supreme Court](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_v._Boyle#Court_ruling) ruled that bail is valid but it just can't be excessive and somehow proportionate to the means of the person being tried. So $50k bail for a misdemeanor by a dude who lives on the street would be excessive. And that makes sense but it is hard to quantify that. The whole point is that bail helps ensure the person will actually show up to court. If the court knows you have family and ties to the community, it can reasonably assume you will show up for trial. But if you have no ID and no ties to the community and you are released without bail, why would you show up to your first hearing? Why would the court expect you to show up?And if you are an illegal immigrant risking deportation, there is absolutely no reason to give them anything, they just have to release you then you can skip bail and run away.Society needs to be able to trust people to work, but when a person commits a crime, even though they are innocent until proven guilty, they have still entered a situation in which the trust we extend them should be limited. Bail is a means of extending trust but also holding the person accountable.If it's found you are innocent of all charges, maybe we could refund the bail or somethjng. But just eliminating bail is foolish. I am aware of that. Acting as if the person you are speaking with doesn't know what that means and then just invalidating the argument is not a good way to discuss.Institutional Racism is racism that is supposedly ingrained into the institution of government. Jim Crow was institutionalized racism. It no longer exists. Institutional racism is racism which precipitates out of racist policy. Racist policy either has been removed from official policy or federal, state, and local governments do not enforce it anymore. Slowly, even those unenforced laws are being officially removed, but again, they aren't enforced (there are many laws that are on the books that go unenforced after time, so this sounds strange but it isn't).Please find me a policy that exists that actually targets minorities and I will fight it with you. We cannot fight this perception that there is racism, we cannot not go into people's heads and change the way they think. There are no such policies today.The only kind of racism that exists today is when individuals hold racist thoughts. On occasion it is possible for a couple racist cops to do some bad things together as a small group as cops, but that is not institutional racism, that is a small group of cops abusing their power and being individually racist. Those people should be fired, sued, and prosecuted should they commit a crime.There is a myth about this racism ghost... this implicit racism. You'll see studies about how doctors prescribe pain relief drugs differently based on some what they argue are psychological factors. We can't make a valid policy to fight that because doctors need to be able to adjust dosages suitable to the specific patient, their size, their health, their specific medical issue, etc.That is not institutional racism. That isn't even racism, it is just a quirk of human nature. If a majority doctor in India treated a minority Indian, the same trend would happen. It turns out that ALL people tend to empathize with people who look more like them and come from similar backgrounds. Black people do this, white people do this, Native Americans do this, Indians do this, Hispanic people do this, everyone has a tendency to have fonder innate feelings for people who look like them. It isn't good, it isn't really bad though. It's also not racist. We don't rationally think one race is better than another, we just connect to our own a little bit better on a very very base level in our brains. We should be aware of this, but this doesn't warrant calling everyone racist.Please do not talk down to people when you clearly don't know who you are talking to nor what I know. You don't come off very smart behaving this way. This is a lie. You and others have twisted the words "culturally significant" to mean something beyond what he meant. In any war, there will be targets that are culturally significant. When were attacked on 9/11, the Twin Towers and the Pentagon were both hit and most people believe that the White House was perhaps another intended target. In a more conventional war, those would be valid targets. They also happen to be incredibly culturally significant to us.If Trump were actually talking about just hitting statues that are 1000 years old just to do it, then yeah. If he's planning on bombing a holy site, then yeah. But you have to read really far into his tweet to believe that, and you can't rightly do that. In a perfect world, what you say sounds super nice, but your point oversimplifies reality. Regardless of criminal background all people accused of the laws listed in the document I link to below cannot be held on bail (I'm sorry it's a link to twitter, if you google "New York New Bail Laws 2020, you can find a link to the document itself. I can't copy the link to on mobile for some reason.):https://twitter.com/JaclynCangro/status/1212382726915051532?s=20Forgive me from pulling from a source this sub hates, but the main stream media won't cover this. The MSM barely reported on the spate of anti-jew attacks happening in NYC that this article touches on. But the article talks about the situation in that manslaughter case.https://www.dailywire.com/news/breaking-man-charged-with-second-degree-manslaughter-released-from-prison-under-democrats-bail-reformBail allows us a means to hold people who are a danger to society as trial awaits. It also serves as a deterrent and as a means of ensuring a tie to the community because family or friends may need to get involved or at the very least you must offee up your bank account.Why not start a charity to help people who might have just made a mistake rather than drastically change the laws that protect so many? First, it is not racist. You would need to prove that it was invented specifically to hurt black people. Just because something disproportionally happens within a monority group, doesn't make it racist. We all agree that theft is wrong. We want to equally protect people from theft. In order to do so you target the crime of theft. Now, if it happens that one group of people are stealing more frequently then other groups, yes, those people will have a higher rate of ticketing or incarceration because they have a higher rate of that crime. You aren't targeting that race, you are still just targetting the crime.Now there are racist or bigotted laws that you could theoretically enact and some that have been enacted. For instance, perhaps I could magically make reading the Quran in any public park illegal. That would target Muslims unfairly.If you can find laws on the books that do that, I will protest them with you. But as far as I am aware, all the laws that we are talking about are agreed upon as reasonable standards. Rape being illegal protects people of all races, if for some strange reason, one group of people tend to have a higher rate of that crime, you would then see a higher rate of them incarcerated for rape. That isn't racism. (Edit to clarify) Now if crime in general is a problem in a specific community, the same applies so long as all the crime we are punishing are all agreed upon. Every law being enforced is a law we all agree has a reason. Carrying an illegal firearm, theft, murder, arson, vandalism, etc... these are all illegal acts for all races. (End edit)Now you can look at that another way as well. If black communities see more theft issues and we deploy police to deal with it, we are sending those police to enforce theaw so that law abiding citizens in that predominantly black community are protected from more theft. Police are keeping more people in that community from being victims of theft.So enforcing laws that deal with petty crime, you are using more resources to help law abiding citizens in those communities. By sending more police to communities where crime is more rampant and by enforcing laws we all agree all races should follow, the police are helping the law abiding citizens of that area by 1) simply reducing the crime rate which then protects the law abiding people, their property, and their community, and 2) by making the community feel safer and nicer which invites more business, more investment in property, and property values to increase.There are home owners in poor communities owned by relatively poor people. Say their home is only with 40K while there is crime and graffiti all over, then the police come in and take a tough stance on crime. The graffiti is seen less and less, the theft happens less and less, there are fewer broken windows, there is more reasom to invest in businesses and property there. After 20 years, that home that was only worth 40K and was owned by a person who grew up in the area might now own a home thar doubled in value. They could refinance a loan, maybe turn it into a rental unit, and suddenly, that family now has a business and an asset that is making them money. Their property taxes will fund the schools in the community, they will have more money to spend at businesses in that community. Their kids who might not have had a shot at school before can now afford to at least send them to MCC.All of this would drastically help people of that community by bringing prosperity into the community, and that all began with enforcing the laws that you argue are racist. There were tons of examplea of that after the 2016 election. Lot's of pictures of graffiti saying stuff like "make america white again". The media shared all these pictures not talking about who actually made the graffiti. Almost every time it was a person of color. In fairness, I don't think they were all trying to frame white nationalists or something. I think they were more just lashing out, but the media took it all as racism by white nationalist types and ran with it. By the time the truth was disseminated, the damage was done. This article and the claim are stupid. You act like this is about ego when the truth is that not wanting to appear weak like a predecessor is probably about strategy. Obama's weakness affected his policy and emboldened Iran and terrorists. Not wanting to appear weak is notnan ego thing, it would curb that effect on the region. I'm not saying bail reform isn't necessary, but this is tying law enforcement's hands behind their backs. People ought to be innocent until proven guilty, but bail is a tool to ensure that dangerous people have a hoop to jump through. So you catch a guy stalking, the new law says you have to let him out. The judge can't consider anything, he can't look at him and feel out if this dude was just stalking or planned to murder his victim. The judge can't set bail because there is a fear the woman will be harmed. The guy just walks and we hope.There was just a dude who admittes manslaughter and was just released. How messed up is that? This data is weak and the article even admits it. We are aleady failing to address petty crime, including basic traffic. I've seen too much in the shifting of the way precincts report crimes to bolster the appearance of good effects to trust something so weakly supported. This has happened so many times over the years.I'm all for reforming bail rules, but this is a step too far. And this social justice effort that claims bail practices are racist is ridiculous, which is what this is all based on. Poor people disproportionally commit crime and unfortunately, the truth is that Black Americans are disproportionally poor. That isn't the result of current racism, though there are certainly historic aspects that have affected this. People still choose to commit crime but lawmakers are acting like criminal behavior is an illness.So what people keep doing is arguing for and implementing changes that address a percieved active racism that doesn't actually exist. If the goal is to eliminate racism, then this strategy actually prolongs the problem. By not addressing crime more directly in those poor communities, the crime levels keep the community from thriving. This hurts the people of those communities as it stagnates their property values when they are able to own homes, it scares businesses away which reduces local job availability, and it tends to lead to people not taking care of their community. Imagine if you worked hard, bought a home in a pooree community where you grew up, and then cops brought the crime down... your house would increase in value by a ton just because law enforcement stepped up.I know the website I'm going to link to is not looked at positively in this sub but [a guy who basically admitted to manslaughter was just release of hisnown recognizance](https://www.dailywire.com/news/breaking-man-charged-with-second-degree-manslaughter-released-from-prison-under-democrats-bail-reform). That is messed up. How do you think a community does when someone who killwe another person is just walking around?From the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/31/nyregion/cash-bail-reform-new-york.html): *Under the new law, judges will no longer be able to set bail for a long list of misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies, including stalking, assault without serious injury, burglary, many drug offenses, and even some kinds of arson and robbery.*So stalkers can just leave court and go on stalking. Assaulters who got lucky and happened to not beat someone to death because some good samaritan stepped in before it got too bad can just leave. Arsonists can just walk.A lot of violent criminals also happen to do more petty crimes and catching them when they commit those petty crimes helps in pinning those violent crimes or even preventing them.So right now, we don't have an longitudinal studies, just some anecdotes and very weak data, yet New York State is going all in. The new laws about holding criminals is incredibly irresponsible. That's not Rochester's fault, but Rochester will have to deal with it. Crime will increase. I really don't understand what Albany is thinking. Every person in law enforcement I speak to say this is insane. You are reading too far into this. There are all kinds of targets that are culturally significant. If we were attacked, D.C. would be a valid target, it also happens to be significant to our culture. A lot of culturally significant areas also happen to be target rich. Who would actually say they would commit war crimes? Be reasonable. Stop reading the worst possible thing into everything. Fair, but the media and reddit are all concerned WWIII is starting. They kill a contractor? This guy has killed hundreds of Americans and other people over the years.Yeah, just a contractor. Are you trying to mock us with this? You trusted polls, too. That's why it hurt so bad when Hillary lost.You can't trust polls, but you can trust trolls to think they are clever. To some degree, yes. But this is a bit different. There was an attempted attack on our embassy, Trump thwarted it so that may add to his approval rating, but he also killed an enemy combatant who happens to also be Iranian military. If it weren't for the connection to the Iranian military, this should also add to his approval rating. The thing is, the hard left is dead set on calling this an act of war, an "escalation", a rise in tensions... etc. They are so militant about it that the rhetoric I hear is dangerous. The media is playing into this fear as well. Being the media is still very powerful, you would think that this fear might hurt the president's approval rating.In other words, this is more complicated. It's more of an "incident" in the public's view than a "conflict". At least, this is why I think it's a bit surprising. I believe we've had words before, but I must respect this and your willingness to take a beating from the mob. I'd give you gold but I don't really think reddit needs my money. I also have none at the moment... Anyway, I'm sure we differ politically (iirc), but it's nice to see agreement from time to time. Mockery instead of reason. Good work. I know many. About 30% of them are leaving the democrats and deciding to vote Trump and/or register republican.Obama pushed the victim mentality on many. Unfortunately many bought it despite things being the best they had ever been. *Our* president :)So a terrorist is different from a terrorist. By the way, that potential nuclear power is thanks to Obama's lax policies. You are now arguing that the president should be more careful with a power who might have nuclear capability because of a president who lacked the fortitude and wisdom to stand up to them in the first place.Gotcha.That is like being robbed at knife point, not standing up to them, giving them a gun, and then being mad when someone stands up to them because they have a gun. You should be mad at the person who gave them the gun. Ah, but you fail to see that the OP was already operating in bad faith. First they flooded the argument with references which is a fallacy that forces those they are arguing against to dismiss every single one of the claims. And it is clear this person was doing so dishonestly because they citations they used are weak at best. Their whole premise was wrong and hinged upon a taking the evidence they cited and misinterpreting it.Basically they cited poll results before and after a political leader took a stance on it. Then they claimed that the up tick in support after the leader made their argument is a vile act of blindly following that only republicans do. Did you know there was an uptick in support for anti-drunk driving efforts after there was national discussion about it? Did you know there was an uptick in awareness of shaken baby syndrome after a health authority started talking about it on the national level?It turns out everyone does this. Support for government run health care won't gain as much support until the politicians actually start talking about it and supporting it themselves. Support for free college gets a spike when the political leaders come out in support of it. [Here](https://www.freecollegenow.org/polling) is a site that is clearly in support of free college saying how Democrat candidates talking about free college was a good thing for the movement because it got more democrats to support it. This is common sense behavior, this is how advertising and the spreading of ideas has always worked, but the OP uses this behavior as evidence that the Republicans only support what the president tells them to support. It also turns out when political leaders push the idea the Jews are evil, you'll also see an uptick in support of that. It turns out when political leaders come out against the idea that Jews are evil, you will see a downward trend as a result. This is basic human nature, it is common sense. When more authoritative figures talk about something, more people begin to agree, sometimes for better sometimes for worse. Everyone does it.The OP used something so common to human nature across parties, across time, and across cultures as a source for hatred against Republicans. The user created a false dichotomy and then flooded the argument with invalid citations as reasoning.Here's a claim: Running red lights is a primarily democrat problem. If I cite a list of incidents of democrats running red lights and causing accidents, but just fail to list evidence of republicans doing the same thing, then I'm being dishonest. That is what the OP did. Another post was made not too long ago saying that only republicans sexually abuse people. They flooded the list with all kinds of people and incidents, many of which hardly fit the claim. Where was Bill Clinton's name in this list, where was Weinstein's name? What about Kevin Spacey? Bill Cosby? All democrats...That form of argument is dishonest from the start and instead of seeing their argument for the trash it is, you folks are saying I am dishonestly arguing for pointing out his dishonesty. It's backwards. You seem like a reasonable enough person. You should see this.The whole post is arguing that republicans don't argue in good faith as a blanket statement... and then he proceeds to argue in bad faith. Do you not see that? I made claims and justified them. The person who says i am being dishonest has to then refute my points.Just because there aren't links doesn't mean i didn't justify my argument. Your tactic here is actually dishonest. He made no one act racist, he made people think others were by pushing this narrative that everything is racist and undermined the police all across the country as a result. Actually, this has emboldened a lot of anti-white and anti-jew sentiments. There has been a huge spate of incidents in NYC and othrr places of people attacking Jews in public. Di Blasio is doing nothing about it. The extra governmental actions of a terrorist means he is not just a government official. In other words, you are giving him diplpmatic immunity for war crimes because he is technically a member of a government.The man was a terrorist. There were crowds of Iranian citizens thrilled this monster was killed.The man was a terrorist. He was at war with us even if Iran technically wasn't. This is how Islamic Jihad works and you are buying into it. They hide behind these technicalities, they hide weapons in schools and hospitals because hitting them would look so bad for us. Meanwhile they are the ones hising weapons in schools and hospitals.If a murderer picks up a kid to prevent the cops from shooting him, the murderer is at fault for endangering the child's life. No one wants to hurt the kid, but in the moment they might get hurt... you are blaming the cops and not the horrible monster of a human being.They do this politically, too, and you've bought into it. Or they appease your demands like a kid in a class finally calming down after they teacher threatens detention, then they wait just long enough and start it up again.You guys are defending a terrorist regime that happens to also participate in running a government. So people rioting is Trump's fault...You are justifying riots(and these were riots with cop cars being flipped and burned, windows breaking, looting, and effigies being stoned and burned) denying the election because you think it is wrong to question the election. The dude just made a comment, you folks rioted.Rioting is your choice, not the president's. That is like hearing someone say "man, i wish there was a way to just get rid of Peyton Manning" then complaining aboutbhow offensive that is while beating up Tom Brady. They were actually rioting, saying they wanted to nullify the election, while Trump made a quip to a media machine that already hated him.You guys don't see how insane this is. You also don't see how your insanity is hurting you and how it is leading to 35% of the Black vote supporting Trump.So I mean keep it up. You're really only hurting yourselves at this point. I hope you don't end up killing anyone like so many of you say you want to do. Downvotes do not invalidate an argument. You are a coward. Prove anything I said was false. Prove it. You claim I am lying, the burden of proof is on you. This is bullshit and bad faith arguing. You can do the exact same thing with democrats and make it worse. I swear you guys pull from the communist playbook and accuse others of what you are doing.Exhibit 1: Obama takes out a radical Muslim who killed many of our own people and who we'd been hunting, everyone cheers when he is killed. Trump kills a guy who has killed many of our own over the years and tried to pull another Benghazi, and you are all like "but the escalation". They're terrorists, they are at like an 8 constantly, then we tell them to stop screwing around by finally showing some balls and they knock it up to a 10 for a few weeks, after which they settle back down to a 7. They will always escalate when we finally push back. Deciding not to act because terrorists will be mad at us is like saying not to tell a kid to stop biting snd kicking all the other kids because he will throw a tantrum when you punish him. What makes that worse is when someone lets them do what they want for 8 years and then finally the new guy comes in and has to rein everyone back in. Suddenly you have to set the boundaries, which makes everyone madder... the boundaries should have been well established but Obama let them slip.Exhibit 2: "Republicans will never accept the election results" hard cut to: millions of democrats all over the country literally rioting in the streets of major cities because they think the election was illegal. That was unprecedented, and what's worse is Hillary was a shitty candidate. So you folks rioted for an election between a turd sandwich and a giant douche. It's not like it was an election between Lincoln and Hitler with Hitler winning. They were two bad choices, and still you rioted. Also cut to the impeachment proceedings from even before the president was elected. Hypocrites.Exhibit 3: race relations had been steadily getting better through the 80's, 90's, and 2000's. Suddenly Obama takes office, starts spreading this narrative of racism all over the country instead of defending our police, giving credence to this absurd idea that white people are still keeping black people down despite him literally holding the highest office in the world. Race relations took a dive because of him and the media, otherwise, in our personal lives and in the spaces we all share, things had been going pretty damn good. All because Obama was incredibly negligent about his rhetoric and told you things were as bad as ever when they were demonsteably better.All of these exhibits that this user points to are about people changing opinions when presented with ideas that leaders present them. This is natural for all of us. How many democrats were for Obama Care until he pushed it? You'll notice a spike in support after he promotes it. Is that a sign of a maleable and dishonest base of democrats? No. It's just a sign that politicians both enact policies as well as garner support and awareness of them.Stop trying to foment a civil war. If you want to know where the Russians really poked at us, it's here where all this needless and irrational rage exists. I wouldn't be surprised if some of these best of posts that are so blatantly full of misinformation are from Russians or something.It is absolutely mind boggling how you folks twist these studies and polls and read into them something so nefarious when there are obvious examples of your side's terrible behavior that you just ignore.I'm willing to admit the right makes mistakes, but they aren't even close to the vile, evil, horrible traitors you make them out to be. They voted for a guy you don't like... that's treason? This is dangerous rhetoric you're posting.EDIT: mobile typos Sure it's hostile. But an act of war? Or an act worthy of going to war and ending in millions of lives? Again, taking out Putin for hostility would be an assassination.Russia flying their jets into a no fly zone is hostile. Is it worth launching nukes? No. It results in no lives lost.The man we killed is at war with us. Putin isn't killing us right now he has not declared war on us. That would be an assassination. This guy has declared war on us. He is the initiator?You have a terrorist who killed people and threatens to kill more in an unending war and Trump is the one who initiated it?You are acting as if I shoot a dude on a murdering spree that I initiated the whole thing.Further, the people that cause violence after such an incident are the ones who cause the violence. We defended ourselves and many others from a terrorist. We caused nothing.This is not an interesting take, it is a sane take. The rest of reddit is nuts. It is not an act of war, it is not an assassination. This man was at war with the west and has caused the deaths of Americans, Westerners at large, and Middle Easterners. He is responsible for many deaths. That is why this is rightfully considered a defensive strike.No one wants war, Trump especially, and he has shown that he doesn't want war.What is insane is that when Bin Laden was taken out under Obama's administration, everyone celebrated, the right, center, and left. He was responsible for many many deaths, not just from 9/11 but prior to that and all over his region and all over the world. The killing of this guy is almost the same thing except this time the left is going insane with rage about it, worried that it will cause an escalation?Yeah, there will be some violence for the next few days... but they really upped the violence all through Hanukkah already, and the left didn't care. But after what is unarguably a victory for anyone who hates terrorism, if there is an escalation, the left thinks it's Trump's fault. This is stupid. You literally have a terrorist responsible for the deaths of Americans and middle easterners, someone who is already at war with the entire west through Jihad. And you folks are mad that this guy was taken out because you think it's an escalation? We haven't escalated anything, they've been operating at an 8 since the late 70s(edit: and up it to a 9 or 10 whenever they see a weakness), they will attack us an our allies even after giving them billions in aid, we then kill one of their leaders of the Jihad against literally all if the west (bringing up our level to about a 7 for the first time in a year maybe) and then you guys get mad because they will now bring it up to a 10?That's like getting mad at the teacher in the room when he tells a student to quit fooling around and then the kod eacalates.If you want to know who Russian meddling affected, look at the people who are mad at the top terrorist of the world being killed when barely a term ago you were celebrating the president  in office when we got Bin Laden.You are full tilt insane. When you treat theae terrorists with kid gloves, they will take more and more and call you idiots behind your backs. I am a mod and I was referring to calling Bernie a piece of shit. That is not what I was referring to. Come on, man, don't play coy. I was giving you a break. She is preaching doom. She is propaganda. She is being used and she is demonizing people and categorizing them as enemies when their stances are actually reasonable. Trump is not anti-environment neither are republicans at large. The environment actually benefits from a more advanced culture, the environmental impact of the US has declined greatly as we have learned to do more with less and that is almost entirely a result of the free market which Trump is defending. Thunberg is making Trump out to be an enemy when him just letting the free market do what it does is actually doing more for the environment than someone like Obama pushing regulations that just lead to corruption or misuse of funds. So should we kill all those children of parental mistakes? Should we kill all financially burdensome people? Should we kill all people with difficult diseases to deal with?Gee, it sounds like your one step away from what Hitler thought. I don't like to invoke the name of Hitler... but ffs, that is messed up thinking. Free markets aren't built around that... free markets are built around the principle that I can own my stuff and freely trade it with whomever I want for whatever we agree to. That is it. Because people sometimes cheat that system, you claim the system is built around something it is is not. It is a dishonest representation of free markets. 2 year olds aren't really capable of that thought either. Neither are people in a coma. Guess we should just kill them. Please watch the civility. I guess poor people can't have joy or the desire to live. Nor can they better their lives...I would hate for you to make decisions for poor people just trying to make a life for themselves. Your idea is just let them die. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46994583The wording of this law is much like the way medical marijuana works. For any reason you can get an abortion up to the woman going into labor and pushing the baby out so long as it "endangers the health of the woman" or it is "not viable". If the woman just has anxiety about being a mom, there's your reason. There is no one overseeing this. You could kill a baby ready to be born. That is messed up. So what? If something is true, don't be scared of it because you think people won't like it. Yes, it is statistically accurate. There are no studies that say democrats do it more than republicans, but all the trends imply that they do. African American women are almost 4 times more likely to have abortions than white women, Hispanics maybe 2 times. Both groups lean very very left. Households where the parents are unmarried are more likely to have abortions... again, they are also more likely to be democrats. People in cities are far more likely than people who live in more rural counties, again, city residents are far more likely to be democrats. Younger people have more abortions than older people... again. All the demographics of abortion fit much more to the demographics of democrats.That is not to say democrats are evil or that all or even more of them are for abortion. It is simply obvious that democrats are much more likely to have abortions. This doesn't even make sense in the context. Be a better person. Wall? It's like 5 sentences.I'd rather be a boomer (I'm not) than an intellectual coward. You will destroy this country. And you are assuming who I do and don't support and why. I don't know about you, but I only judge people based on what I have seen them do. I have no idea who you support. And I don't really care. You entered this thread immediately hating ALL republicans for the actions of one and made this about politics when it is about 1 asshole.Shall we condemn you for Kennedy killing a young woman with his car? Shall we condemn you for Bill Clinton lying under oath and committing perjury? No, because that is ridiculous, but that is what you are doing to me and other people who are not democrats. It is sickening.You are the one full of hate. I have. You have no idea who you are talking to. All parties assert morality. One says killing a baby in the womb is wrong, one says it is not. Both are moral stances.You are proving yourself ignorant on the topic and brainwashed about political parties. Laws are moral stances, and politics is all about passing laws.ALL parties push morality, dumbass. That is not true. But okay. No, it means don't do undue harm to your fellow Republicans. There is a difference between testifying and admitting when someone you are on a team with did something wrong, and participating a sham that is designed to get you to say something they can twist for whatever means they wish. They do both... basically they are like the amp in a feedback loop. They take what the guitar did and pumps it out. The amp can make it louder or bassier... how you change all the dials affects the way the person playing the guitar decides to play it. I would like to leave your comment up because you were arguing with a troll and I really enjoyed the biting rhythm of your comment. But it does break our civility rules. Please do us and the sub a favor and just report these guys rather than giving in to that urge we all have with trolls. Because the left in the state have an irrational fear and hatred of the right. I don't live in NYC anymore, I live upstate. But it is interesting to read the threads of my home town. The Republicans in my area pulled some political strategy that was frankly a bit unbecoming, but the strategy served a purpose. They were trying to limit what the incoming county executive could do by reducing the threshold of money expenditure that triggers a review by the county legislature.Anyway, the democrats obviously took this personally. And honestly, it was a bit underhanded though the fears of the republicans that led to their move was valid, it's just that the move looked so underhanded because it was done at the last minute. The incoming dem county exec wants to implement some very expensive programs. And this state is already going to hell with the taxes and state leadership. So the republicans seemed to think this would be a good idea. They were blasted by the local media.Anyway, my point is that they know Cuomo is corrupt. They know most of the state is corrupt. They know the state has been run by Democrats almost completely consistently for decades now save for a couple terms of a Republican governor. They know the promise of "free college" is fraught red tape and isn't the gift Coumo made it sound like. So I asked them why they wouldn't vote 3rd party or for a republican. They gave some strange answers that implied that they think Republicans are somehow more corrupt (when they haven't had control in forever except for some pockets of local governments), and that they hate republicans. So they would rather see the state burn than to hand it over to people who at least act like they want to be more fiscally responsible.Basically, it is the media. The media and a real echo chamber that rules the New York voter. I love how you knowingly broke the rules and then complain about how mods behave.EDIT: it's kind of like how you look at illegal immigration. You see these people knowingly break our laws and then complain when that bites them in the ass. You see someone take a lax stance on immigration (while having preached a strong stance on it, making Obama a hypocrite) and then you get upset when someone comes in and actually applies the law. Then you cry "but the spirit of the law!!!!" What the hell are you talking about? Is the spirit of the speed limit that you go "around 55mph" or is it 55mph? It's 55mph. The spirit of the law?You are turning this into some vague idea about things SHOULD be rather than what they are. The law deals with the realities. Even "productive members of society" as you call them, can be here illegally, can have come here illegally, and should be dealt with legally. A productive member of society doesn't steal from that society... illegal immigrants do. They don't pay taxes and yet they enjoy many benefits of our society.We do not think they are all or even mostly bad people, but they are taking advantage because we are letting them. There is no reason they can't follow the legal protocols to enter this country and there is almost no reason why they can't comply with the rules once they are here, such as leaving when their time is up. On occasion there may be instances where someone accidentally overstays their visa, or maybe they even cross the border in an attempt to escape an imminent danger and then hide out here or something. Those instances are incredibly rare and when they do happen, leniency is given. >You realize virtually none of them "slink across the border" right?This is not true. They are caught constantly crossing the Rio Grande as well as many other places. There are those in Mexico who are paid by hopeful illegal immigrants to lead them across the border. It happens all the time.It is dishonest to say it doesn't happen.EDIT: typo Yes, by citizens of that country. Stand on someone's neck? It is standing on someone's neck to uphold your laws?This isn't some kind of imperialist act where we are going into their lands and kicking them out by force, they are coming here, not following our rules, and getting kicked out. Don't pretend this is tyranny when it is simply not allowing people to take advantage. The tool is never the problem. The left will try to sell it as the problem.Freedom requires that we trust each other, and trust leaves us vulnerable. There will always be people who abuse that trust and hurt others, with guns, with fists, with cars, with money, with words, with deception... etc. All of these tools used to hurt people are able to be used because we are free to use these tools. A compass in a math class is a tool, it is points and you could injure someone badly with it... we trust that people will use these tools appropriately and with the respect they deserve. But someone somewhere will undoubtedly use it to stab another student or accidentally hurt someone when they try to make it stick in the ceiling tile. The cost of that freedom to use that tool is the risk that someone will do something stupid with is.Guns are a very important tool. Guns allow the people to revolt should the government become a tyranny. Why do you think there are those in power who would like to remove guns from our world? Now many in power (like senators or congressman or state officials) might simply think as you do: that preventing these horrible events is worthy of finding some strong restrictions on guns... many go further though and believe all guns should be out of the hands of citizens. They do this with the good intention of wanting to prevent tragedy. However there are those in power, those who really have power, who know what guns really are. They are a tool that gives people power over rulers should those rulers turn on them. And these people use the fear of gun violence, and the wishful thought good intentions of people like you and all these congressmen and senators and such, to attain their goal of gun confiscation.We cannot have freedom without the risk of people abusing it. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that stricter policies will do anything but hurt law abiding citizens. I'm not the one insulting for simply saying we should listen to people with whom we disagree. Talk about a bad party vibe. Lol I don't believe you.But okay. Take care :) You don't understand his actions then. You should listen to him. Give him a shot.You've probably never listened to the guy ever and yet you hate him... how stupid is that?Take care. This is already happening to some degree in a lot of schools. The way the laws work, the schools have to be very careful with students who don't belong in a standard school.The idea that we have a right to an education needs to change. We have the privilege of an education, one that we should lose if we ruin the experience for others. There is an interview he does with Dave Rubin that's pretty interesting. You should watch it instead of assuming the worst of someone. Before I begin, I have to point out that your question is a little odd to be honest. I mean it's a curious question and it is valid to wonder about. But it presupposes a lot about God that is based on concepts that are not Biblical. If you want to understand the Biblical God then you should conceive of the Biblical God. From there you can decide whether you agree with this God or not.Many atheists argue against a God that can do literally anything... but that is not the God of the Bible. God has limits. I mentioned the limit with free will. We have free will and the Bible is true, then God can't mess with our free will. This mean God has imposed a limit on Himself. So the Biblical conception of God is one that holds free will in such high regard that He will not mess with it. There are other limits in the Christian conception of God. For instance, according to God, His will is that we are all healed and that none of us get sick. Clearly, we get sick. So then why is their sickness if God wants us all to be healed? Again, free will... our choice has led to this world. And there are other rules as well that build a conception of God that is very different than the one you present here. Good would not create that kind of a world.If you want to argue about a God existing or not, you should argue about the one that is being presented to you, you shouldn't make up a God that you think we believe and argue against that, you should argue against the God we describe to you. You have gone the other way here, you have conceived of your own God and are basically asking us to prove your God exists. I don't believe your God exists.Now onto your question:Most of philosophy says so. If you cannot do something, by definition you are not free. If your thought is limited, then your thought is not free. Not only that, but if your thought is limited to only what is righteous and you cannot think about what sin is, then understanding itself starts to unravel. Your whole point here rests on this idea if I may boil down what you said: Freedom within a boundary is free if you don't know there is a boundary. If I live in a prison, but I don't realize it's a prison, then from my perspective I am as good as free, right? This might be nice, but it is not possible, again, understanding of reality would break down.Here is a thought experiment to explain why that is:You are in a world as you described. You are incapable of sin and it can never enter your mind as a temptation. Aside from that, you are a child learning about the world.You are hungry. Your friend has an apple.Before we even get to the part of the story where you *want* the apple, the idea of ownership has already entered our scene? **Your friend has an apple**. The problem is the idea of ownership can't exist in your world. If we are incapable of knowing what sin is and it never entered our mind, then your friend's ownership of that apple can't be understood. Even before we really get to the problem of you wanting the apple, you can't even understand ownership.To understand ownership you need to understand at the very least 3 things, 1) that we are separate individuals, 2) that individuals can own something like an apple as an individual, and 3) that taking something another individual owns is bad. For ownership to be true 1 must be true because ownership is inconsequential if you are the only entity, and then 3 must follow 2 because if it is not wrong to take from someone else, then ownership doesn't exist. Even in collectives where "ownership" doesn't exist, the concept still works, you still don't take your friend's soup from his hands because you are hungry... ownership still exists, it is hyperbole to say it doesn't, it's just that those cultures share to an extreme.By the way,when I say "bad" it could be personally bad, bad for the individual who is being taken from, bad for the person doing the taking, bad from a standpoint of sin, bad for the society... whatever the case, the point is that you must conceive that it hurts someone to take from another.So in our thought experiment, we have already seen that ideas like ownership cannot be understood without knowing that it is bad to take from someone else. We have already established that to understand a rather basic concept of reality in a society, you must understand that bad can happen. So you cannot have a social reality without people at least conceiving of what is bad. So we have crossed off a piece of your question because the thought must at least be able to enter your mind for you to just understand reality. What if God could just abolish the idea of ownership? That would eliminate the need to think about that sin, right? How do you eliminate ownership? Do you eliminate scarcity? If nothing is scarce then you wouldn't need to own anything, right? Maybe God could make a world where there is no such thing as scarcity at all. God could do this in 2 ways, 1) make everything available all the, all the food, all the things like guitars and beds... and then all the whims people might have because If I want to go rock climbing, but there isn't a rock climbing place near me, then that means there is scarcity. Or 2) God could program us to only want certain things. This doesn't really eliminate what scarcity is, but it removes the problem of scarcity from the world. So God provides all the food and shelter we need, maybe some other comforts, maybe some leisure things, but aside from that, the world is very simple and there is no desire for us to do anything other than what is available. 1 would test physics, but God is powerful enough to change the very idea of physics I suppose, 2 wouldn't eliminate scarcity it would just keep us from knowing it exists... this would eliminate our understanding of ownership. There would be no need to own anything. Right? Problem solved.Almost, what about you as an individual. Is your hand yours? Is your mind yours? Are your feet yours? You still need the idea of ownership to conceive of the reality that you are an individual. I can move my hand, I can grab your hand and make it move... is it okay for me to do that?You cannot eliminate the idea of ownership when we are individuals. So we have just seen that we cannot even understand reality without conceiving of acts that would be sinful, acts that would impede another's individuality.So this world you want to create would drastically change all of reality. Individuals couldn't exist in that universe.So the idea of sin must at least be conceived of to understand the world, but why must it lead to a temptation? Again, your whole point seems to rest on the idea that freedom within a boundary is still freedom so long as you do not know there is a boundary. Well we've just proven that we need to be able to see there is a boundary... we need to be able to conceive of sin in order to simply understand the world... so we MUST see that boundary.So for anything like this reality to exist where individuals are separate and conscious, you need to know ownership exists and you must conceive of it being bad to take something someone else owns. Otherwise no one can understand reality at all. So we need that at the very least.If we have that, then the next thing God could do would be to put some kind of block in our brains. So we could conceive of taking our friend's apple to eat it, but God would block us from even conceiving of the idea that I could actually make that choice and do it.Can you trust a God who would do that? Can you trust a God who could selectively place these blocks in your head?I could go on and on... What do you think would be the potential of adapting these plants to somehow treat the water as they pump it back out and remove any of those contaminants? Could there be a means of at least putting a dent in that contaminant problem as we pump it back? I mean if we are going to work on that problem, you would think this would be a great place to tap in to help that problem.While there are tons of issues that arise when thinking about how we can make the best of the opportunities we have, I think it is clear there are some really great opportunities despite the weaknesses you mention. Market forces are always one of the last considerations I have when thinking about possibilities because they shouldn't stifle the imagination, but they are certainly an important factor in implementing these ideas.I just think people don't think about the possibilities enough and often don't see that some very creative solutions to problems exist. A lot of garbage dumps are producing a lot of usable natural gas that is tapped and used, it uses up all the bio mass in the landfill and leaves plastics and metals and other chemicals. At some point I imagine we will be mining old landfills for usable materials... not to mention that we already are tapping into the possibility of bacteria that eat plastics... that would increase the biomass that could theoretically increase the gas output of those landfills leaving very little mass remaining.Anyway, just spit balling a bit here. No, you are rude because you are not thoughtful or respectful of others and now you are just spewing things you've heard rather than discussing rationally.Take care. The point is still that the effect on the environment is negligible even if we don't actually remove any salt. But we could and it would result in a byproduct that is useable even if not for human consumption (and by the way, my guess is that the contaminants that would be left on b the salt would be negligible and will within the acceptable standards. Also there is likely a cost effective means of treating it to remove these things you're concerned with. We aleady have a sea salt industry. You make it sewn. As if this is beyond the realm of possibility when we already do these things. And again, we can find use for the salt even if we can't consume it. And again that is only an issue if the salt concentration worry is legitimate, which it doesn't seem to be. Thank you for putting it far more eloquently than I could have! No, but you are now being rude.The dustbowl was a horrible drought in the US. Did it cause war? No. Most droughts don't lead to war. They cause strain on a society. That strain, if there are other outside factors, may exacerbate tensions, but the cause of war is the choice to go to war. I don't think there is a single war where drought was even the greatest factor in a civil war. The cause is usually the mismanagement of things in the face of a drought. For instance if there is a drought and the wealthy take what little food there is all for themselves rather than attempt to distribute it.That would lead to anger that might actually cause a war. The drought merely revealed the behaviors of the selfish elite. This basically happened in the Irish Potato Famine if I recall correctly. A similar behavior happened prior to the French revolution.The cause of war is not the drought, it is the mismanagement and callousness of the leadership in the face of the drought. Otherwise there would be a hell of a lot more war.Again, you are grasping and I would argue that you are the one being obtuse, and rather rude, frankly. Right, because the Rwandan Genocide is the West's fault. Saddam Hussein's gassing of his own people was the West's fault.You can blame the west for a lot of things, but you can't blame the west for evil decisions of leaders who decide to murder people. No. You aren't thinking deep enough.First, the water taken from the oceans would return to the water cycle, as most of it would be used in agriculture anyway, so the return would be pretty fast anyway. Secondly, if temps rise, more fresh water ice will melt and drain into the oceans which would dilute the salinity of the oceans anyway.Sand is trash for roads, it doesn't help at all except in the coldest conditions.Both of your objections are objectively false. That is not the cause of the war. Droughts have been happening since the beginning of time and not one caused a war.All this article does is say "See a DROUGHT... also A WAR!" And then it makes people like you think one caused the other. That is not how causality works. Thanks! I'm sure there are several processes and perhaps I am not doing the one I saw justice. It was also on an episode of Dirty Jobs I saw many years ago... perhaps I am confusing the process with another episode where they used the technique I described. Whatever it was, the point of the process was to remove waste from a system in a way that was energy efficient and rather environmentally sound. I believe they do a forced osmosis system which pushes water through a membrane, leaving the salt. In the case of Israel, currently the system simply releases the brinier water back into the sea. They make something like 1 billion cubic meters of water right now for all kinds of purposes. That is enough for virtually all their needs agriculturally and I believe for drinking water.Currently, the saltier brine is released back into the ocean. So right now it does leave a rather concentrated briny solution that is not necessarily good for the very local ocean environment. I would have to look but I think the worries are greatly exaggerated, though there could be a legitimate worry. However, the problem seems easily solvable. I don't know how they pump it out currently, but if they just kind of pump it out from one spot right next to the plant, then yeah, that would hurt the ecosystem right in that vicinity. It wouldn't take much... lay a pipe that's a few miles long, and release the saltier brine evenly across that entire pipeline. Problem solved.EDIT Also, as I mentioned elsewhere in the thread, if you make a desalination plant like this that pumps the brine into a big ocean current, it will disperse easily, so the concentration issue won't be a problem if they are built along the ocean, but Isreal is on a sea, so more consideration might be necessary. END EDITBut you could also produce salt this way. Not only that, but ocean water at tremendous volumes have significant amounts of rare minerals that theoretically could be collected along with the salt.The applications for that salt are endless, from cooking, to spreading on icy roads... There are all kinds of industrial applications, too, I'm sure. Right now, a lot of salt for roads is mined. That is a finite resource, this would be an unlimited source of salt.EDIT: typos Really? Have you tried to run a small business or build house? Have you ever tried to buy property? Do you know how many silly laws are on the books that stifle businesses.I know reddit hates PragerU but watch this video... it highlight just one small business owner's experience with what you claim is a market that can't be any freer, and this is just the tip of the iceberg: https://youtu.be/JFsAkxzTFEs Did I say completely free? See you anti-capitalism folks constantly play this game where you make out capitalists to all be complete libertarians about it. That is a dishonest representation. Freer markets lead to more prosperity, there obviously have to be some limits. I don't agree with an absolutely free market either. Pretending like all of us (typo) do is dishonest. What war is a climate change war? Please tell me. And what refugees are climate change refugees? All of those refugees are from bad governments not using their resources properly. None of the wars going on today have to do with climate change.You seem to not understand that most of the technologies that will combat a lot of the perceived problems that people are worried about already exists, and that there is a lot of opportunity for this. Not really. Dump the concentrated salt water into an open air shallow pool, maybe filter it first, then let it air dry. Most sea salt us made this way, they don't apply heat, they just let it air dry. It makes energy costs almost nothing for them.A lot of water cleaning facilities already use this technique in another application as well. They drain the waste water into these shallow poles that dry over a week or two and then they scoop up the dry waste and ship it to a landfill. By then the volume is so little that it hardly takes an energy at all. There is still waste but the water all just returns to the water cycle or right back into the municipal water system.EDIT: Let me clarify, and please forgive me, what I remember of this was from an episode of Dirty Jobs I saw many years ago now. I might be conflating the water cleaning process I saw with a typical water cleaning facility process. I will have to look it up, the process exists though, it might have been in a farming application now that I think about it. But the point is that there are very energy efficient ways to collect soluble or suspended materials from water simply by letting it evaporate. Sure it is. You can collect the salt and use it for all kinds of things.And if you use them in the right spots like a long a massive ocean current, the concentrations of salt will quickly disperse and even out. This is why the future is bright. The climate change alarmism is silly. The worst models are not the ones that will happen, and they have all been wrong. Secondly, the fears about losing drinking water will not happen, Israel already has a plant that makes fresh water out of sea water and they produce enough for their whole country and then some.I bet you that some kind of engineer will produce an energy efficient way of concentrating CO2 by pulling it out of the atmosphere and then pumping it into greenhouse where the plants use it to produce more nutritious crops and more oxygen.They already sort of do this with tomatoes in the UK if I recall correctly. A sugar factor or something pumps the CO2 byproduct directly to a large tomato greenhouse, and it's like gaseous fertilizer for them. It's awesome.We can produce so much food that no one will go hungry if we allow charity and to happen and markets to be freer. So not being able to make racist comments makes it hard to not be anti-republican?I don't think you realize how nonsensical this is. But no matter. And who provides your military protection? :) It's easy to pay for stuff when someone else is covering your defense. Yeah, communist countries were happy at first, too. Germany was happy at first as well. You don't seem to see though that reducing our military spending will put not just american lives at risk, but Europeans, middle eastern, and then American lives at risk again when more instability befalls those regions.By the way, taking money from people just so that others win is called theft. There is a convenient though true issue for genocides and bad choices made by Christian groups. Essentially, when a Christian commits, say, genocide, they are not acting as Christians. This is true. Jesus is clear about murder, you shouldn't do it. So when a Christian does it, they are not acting their creed.Creeds are a different issue than a race or heritage. So the no-true-scotsman fallacy doesn't apply the same way. A Christian can obviously do bad things, but those bad things go against the creed. "No true Christian would murder"... well, not exactly. But it is not their Christianity that is the problem, the creed is clear, you can go look it up. They were not acting as a Christian when they murdered yet they are a Christian. Perhaps they were deceived, perhaps in the heat of the moment they fell on their passion rather than on God and then chose to murder. Christians sin, the sin is not Christian, but the sinner is. Again, it seems so convenient, but it is true. It doesn't excuse bad behavior at all, but it puts the responsibility in the right place.Now there are some creeds that actually encourage murder and genocide. If your religion calls you to take up arms against non-believers, then you can blame the creed as well as  the people carrying it out.There is a trend among a lot of Christians to be very judgmental. You can blame the Christian, you can say that is a common problem with human beings interacting within the creed of Christianity, but Christianity itself is not the cause of it. It is the people. So you can have legitimate arguments against the people who are Christians but again, it is not the Christianity that is to blame when Christianity speaks against that condescending sort of judgment (though other forms of judgment are valid).The difference between the creed and the person who follows the creed is an important distinction that New Atheists deny. And while it is sort of convenient for Christians, it is true.Atheism is a strange case in that an atheist can have a creed, but atheism itself is not a creed. And that is kind of the danger of it. There are atheists who are far more moral than a lot of Christians, Muslims, practicing Jews, etc. The reason we can apply those massive murder counts to atheist movements is not because atheists themselves are immoral or because the rejection of God makes someone a bad person. It is because there is no counter to an idea like genocide when the question arises. In other words, the concept of God and all we know of that concept (at least in the Judeo-Christian world) stands against genocide, so even if your leader might errantly believe genocide is a good idea, you have other believers saying it is wrong and able to cite scripture that says God thinks it is wrong. We have an absolute morality that speaks to it being wrong.With atheism, you can rationalize arguments that would kill off all mentally handicapped people. You can justify that idea by citing the health of the society that a world without mental disorders would create. There are obviously atheist arguments that oppose that as well, but being that there is no objective morality in atheism, both arguments have relatively equal footing... it becomes a matter of opinion as to whether the cost of killing off all mentally handicapped people is worth itIn Christianity, murder is simply wrong. Even when a leader rationalizes some convoluted thinking to justify it, it is wrong. Murder is absolutely wrong and so genocide is absolutely wrong regardless of the ends.This is why atheism on a large scale is so dangerous. It is not because atheists are inherently bad people, it's that their ideas face no absolute morality. Unless atheism can conceive of an ironclad argument as to why murder is absolutely wrong, then it will always have this weakness and it will always be the most prone to the worst genocides. But there can never be an absolute argument against murder in the atheist world view, you simply have to choose to believe it is absolutely wrong. That is not a sound argument. At least in the Judeo-Christian paradigm we have reasons (perhaps not to the standards of the scientific method but still reasons) to trust the Bible and that God exists, and so we have reason to believe the absolute morality against murder. Atheists do not have that. That doesn't mean atheists will just go around murdering, they see the value of protecting our individual lives... but when situations change, when over crowding might happen, when it is actually prudent to murder in order to save the species, what is the argument not to murder? Is there an absolute argument? No. You either think humanity isn't worth saving and you all die, or you think that is foolish and someone needs to decide who lives and who dies for the good of humanity. Both arguments are valid. Why is there suffering in the world? In order for God to be good, he has to give us free will. If we didn't have free will we would slaves and automatons. In order for there to be good, the bad must also exist. If we had a limited free will that only allowed us to pick good things, we would still be slaves. True freedom is being able to do everything, good and bad, to think whatever you want, good or bad. God wanted a people made in his image, which in part means making us worth the same free will God has. So there is suffering because we have free will, we have a choice and some people use their free will to do bad. Accidents also cause suffering, but that would have been easily recoverable had original sin never happened. As for hell, personally, I don't believe in hell, not in the way most Christian's do. I do not believe in eternal torment and I won't go into the scripture for now, but basically the idea is that much of what we think of as hell is a confusion about what Jesus said. He made alluded to hades as well as gehenna. Gehenna was literally an ancient garbage dump that was always on fire or smoldering, and where it wasn't on fire, worms would eat the garbage. So when he talks about people being consumed by the eternal flame of gehenna, he is merely stating that those who reject God will be consumed by fire where the fire is eternal and worms eternally eat. It was a bit of hyperbole to say the flame and worms there are eternal (there are many uses of figurative language in the bible just as we use in our language today), but I argue that he was saying that the place is "eternal" while the torment is not. In other words, those who reject God entirely are not tortured forever, they are removed from the creation entirely and cease to exist. The punishment is hence eternal because the ceasing of existence will last forever. The lake of fire destroys and cleanses. Fire often destroys and cleanses in the Bible, fire almost always consumes in the Bible as well. The one time (as far as I recall) it doesn't consume is at the burning bush. So in atheist terms, those who chose to deny God will end up the same way that atheists believe it happens anyway. They will die and then they will be judged and they will die again and simply cease to be. Everyone got the gift of life, even those who deny God. You can have a greater gift, you just have to choose. There will be no room for sin, so we can't have those who do not pursue the only thing that can keep us from winning, which is God.Miscarriages happen like any other health issue as a result of the choice of man to sin. When sin happened, earth was God's no longer. The legalities of which aren't understood entirely, I have many ideas, but the point is that God doesn't exactly run things down here anymore and the creation was corrupted. All the illnesses and problems with our genes, physical deformities, etc., came into the world. That argument is kind of silly because God says death is the enemy. God clearly doesn't want anyone to die... do you can ask an infinite number of questions "why did/does God allow X?" There is free will and there is an enemy.Do you allow your kid to scrape his knee? No, you can't prevent that because your child chooses to explore the world and will have accidents and make mistakes.People have this concept of God that He can do anything but simply doesn't help when we think He should be able to. God clearly places our free will up on an extremely high place that even He cannot mess with. That adherence to the gift of our free will precludes Him from acting in so many of the ways we would like Him to just jump in and intervene. And the system is so complex that the levels of free will choices that affect any given bad situation are countless.A pedophile chooses to hurt a child. Well what about the choices of people to produce the pornography that this pedophile obsessed over? What about the person who chose to abuse him? What about the parents of the pedophile who neglected him as he was growing up allowing these urges to fester or allowing him to be abuse himself? What about the parents of the child being abused by this pedophile who chose not to heed the warning signs and who left up a lot of weaknesses in their parenting like leaving their kid alone at too young an age? God "allowed" none of those choices, people chose them and they made those choices of their own volition, and those choices led to a situation where both the pedophile exists and the child was in a place to be exploited by that pedophile.Think about all the layers of choices that lead to any horrible act. Any time you have clicked on a porn site, you have fed that industry. You have given money to people who use confused young men and women and exploit them and often abuse them (or simply feed into their bad lifestyle rather than helping them stop). Are you as bad as the pornographers? No. Are you as bad as the people who abused those porn workers (a large percentage of them have been sexually abused or have mental issues like depression)? No. But you made a choice that fed that beast. Even those who believe the porn industry could be healthy know it currently is not healthy at all and they know the damage it can cause. Everytime you allow money to go to porn companies, whether you are paying for it or just seeing ads, you are helping other people to pursue porn and hurt themselves.Anyway, I went off on a tangent there. Many atheist arguments are just chatter and are used to dismiss us. If they are willing to listen to some deeper discussions about what God really is and what free will means, then politely explain that it is more complex than the question implies and that you'd be happy to explain but it will take some delving into our concept of God rather than the atheist conception of what they think we think God is. Lean in but also lean *on* Christ. You have goals, you have a plan, you are acting on it even though it is hard. That is what a man does, your battles just happen to be more social/emotional. Give to Christ what you don't know what to do with and start to use him as your example. Ive finally come to learn what giving him my problems means.  It's not denying them, it's not hoping God will just take them away. It is giving the worry to him, giving the thought to him, giving all the possibilities to him so that you can just focus on the task at hand. I used to think about all the things I could say to my father, I went nuts trying to figure out the right things to say, and I tried from time to time. Then I gave all that to Christ and to God. I focus on what I can do and I show my dad I love him even when he continues to fail. He may never heal, he has to decide, but I can now love him and be kind rather than closed and hard.There comes a time in every son's life when they realize their father doesn't have all the answers and are just another child like we all really are. Even those sons of strong fathers experience this moment, though usually later in their lives. So in some ways you and I are ahead of the curve :)Pray for the country and for all the fathers out there to step up rather than retreat. Society is killing the idea of man, it's easy to feel useless, and then retreat to become useless. You know what a weak man does to a son. You can speak to and encourage those who need to hear how to be better fathers. It was leftist trolling. They were unhappy with calling the meme an example of colluding. The term is actually besides the point. Not the best choice of words perhaps, but the actions of Obama here implies a promise of a future quid pro quo, which dismantles the left's problem with Trump. I would be careful listening to the comment you replied to. I don't mean to say they are entirely wrong at all and I totally understand the anger and frustration that comes out of the comment. I also really resonate with your comment because I often feel the same way. My parents failed me in so many ways. They meant so well. All their intentions were good but they didn't know what we know today, and they were sold a lot of lies just like people are today. Don't get me wrong, they made mistakes that they should not have made at all, but I understand that they were left vulnerable.I said in another comment that my father became an internet addict when the internet was first getting popular. My father works hard and provides for his family, but he is very bad at sharing his emotions and my mother's background left her less affectionate than a lot of women. My father sought affection from women online when he should have worked things out with my mother. I saw this. Not only this, but I had my own internet addiction and I wasn't doing anything good. I was staying up late as well, not listening to the rules, taking advantage of the trust of my parents. They should have been better at keeping me accountable, but I had a strong desire to be online.These factors and others combined and led to me feeling very sad and dejected. I told my mom I thought I was depressed. She did what a mom good mom thought was the right thing to do because the culture was telling her it was the right thing to do. So I started seeing a psychologist. The real problem was that my parents just needed to tighten the reins a little bit and my dad needed to stop doing stupid stuff on the computer. My depression and anxiety probably would have resolved after that... but we all trusted the world, we relied on therapy and eventually drugs instead of facing reality. I went on a cocktail of anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds. I don't know how they have affected my mind and if there is any permanent damage to my brain chemistry. I was basically experimented on, and my parents trusted that that was the right thing to do.Now, I had health scare that happened when I was younger that led to a lot of feelings of worry, inadequacy, pain, and sadness. It is likely I could have developed a depression even if my father didn't do stupid things. So I rightly blame him for his actions that hurt me and my mother, but I forgive him because I know he was unprepared for what the internet was. And I can rightly blame my mother for so eagerly hoping these drugs would work rather than forcing the hard conversations with my father or just leaving him... but she was also unprepared for a world with the internet and she has her own issues that came from an upbringing she had no control over.What I can't blame them for is trusting the doctors and trusting what all of society was telling them, that drugs will help. My father was a terrible role model. He provided, but that was it. It's still as if he doesn't exist. I am still looking for that male role model, I have had to put one together from pieces of various men in my life. I had a conversation with my father once when I was struggling to make ends meet, I was in a depression, and wasn't even trying to work. I brought up the point I made above, I told him that his generation really fucked up... and this is after I've confronted him about his online affairs and his obesity and his callousness. He is not a horrible, abusive, mean person, he is just a sad lump that doesn't get why people don't talk to him, and then he retreats to his computer and talks to women who don't give a shit about him... hurting us even more. This is after I have forgiven him about these things. So I told him about how his generation fucked up, and I looked at him like he should know how he fucked up considering all the crap he did online and was caught doing... and he looked at me and said "when I was a young adult, people just got out and started working and living." I was dumbfounded... it's as if he didn't hear a word I said and didn't see how he messed up. He didn't see how his behavior could cripple a son, he didn't see how he was never really there. Yeah, he did sweet things when we were kids, but he didn't really raise us. He was just there. He was a ghost fading away in the computer room, sad that no one talks to him, but not willing to put in the work to cultivate those relationships.I was so angry and hurt by his complete lack of awareness. I wanted to hit him, I wanted to punch him right in his face. But then I pitied him. I saw how deluded he was. I saw how little he really understood of the damage he did and I saw how little he recognized about how the circumstances I was raised in, with the internet and medications and mass media getting more and more out of control... I saw he had no clue. And as much as that scared me, it also gave me peace. It allowed me to forgive him. As much wrong as he has done, it was not all his fault... he simply didn't know how to handle it and relied on some bad instincts and habits to handle it as best he could.I remember another time I was in college and he came to visit. I had had to forgive him about a thousand times over for all the crap he would do and continued to do. Despite that, it was nice to see him. And as I was sitting there taking a break from my studies, learning to more independent, building confidence, building hope for my future, my dad the lump tells me "I hope you are making friends, because it only gets lonelier as you get older." What the eff kind of bomb is that for a father to drop on a son??? I don't know if these stories convey the gravity of my father's behavior... it was such a said and pathetic sort of abuse... it was him putting all his depression on us thinking it healthy and wise, not realizing how foolish and damaging his words were.The world is ill. I think it is correcting itself though. And it can be fixed, but forgiveness is required.Apartheid ended and forgiveness was needed in mass quantities, but it was there and healing happened.The sickness we see today is different. It isn't violent, it's born of selfishness and neglect. It is born of anger that seethes and breeds in the silence of our minds, expressing itself more online in unhealthy ways than verbally in constructive and healing ways. Forgiveness is needed more than ever.You need to forgive yourself for the failures you make each day, and you need to forgive those who put you at such a disadvantage, making that hole even harder to climb out of. You need to attach yourself to hope that you can change yourself, the knowledge that it is possible, and the drive to seek out that which will help you. I was glad to see you mention church because the hope in Christ is a beautiful thing. The hope that there is something better on the horizon, even if life is a struggle... that has tremendous healing in it.I am also childless and unmarried. But I have bettered my life, I am stable, I plan to be a home owner in a year or two. I just went on a sort of date with a young woman whom I care for very much. I never thought these things would happen. I still worry that something calamitous will occur and ruin my life again... I worry my dad will do something so utterly stupid that it will destroy all I have accomplished. I have done this with hardly any real male role models. You can do it, too. You need to remember that there are forces at work, whether you believe they are spiritual or just human, that want to destroy the family. One of the ways to make society weak is to eliminate the male and female and make us all the same. The concept of what it is to be male has been so weakened by so many things, and the concept of what it is to be a woman has taken a massive hit. There are those who want you not to have role models.... it is no coincidence that there are more men like you and I who had very weak male role models growing up. Look at the African American community. There are so many fatherless homes and it is hurting them so much. There are people who want that to happen.Knowing there is a real enemy out there is helpful.What you have inherited is not what you will end with. I will pray for you. You are loved. Find worth not in what the world has made you want... find worth in doing what you know is good. Focus on that, focus on healing, focus on making a life for yourself and help those even worse off than you. A woman would be nice, but they will not fix your life. Only you can do that... and you CAN do that. They shouldn't apologize for things they didn't do. I think you are over estimating what the older generations did and not fully appreciating what was beyond their control or what they just didn't know.A lot of young people are blaming boomers for climate change. Never mind the alarmist views vs. reality, industrialization and the forces that have led to global warming started long ago... the first real whispers of a problem made the rounds in the 70's or so? That is when the boomers were just becoming adults... they didn't know climate change was real let alone what they could do about it. How do you fix a problem you don't know exists? Boomers were anywhere from there teens to their 30's in the 70's. How fair is it to blame them for buying into social security when we didn't collectively realize there was a problem until maybe 25 years ago? How fair is it to blame boomers for climate change when they were either just teens or well into their careers when the first murmurings of it made it into pop-culture (and were wrong)? How fair is it to blame Boomers for trusting the medical community as the trend to over medicate children began around the 90's? How fair is it to blame boomers for the obesity epidemic when they had no idea what was actually healthy? How fair is it to blame them for all the mental health issues associated with the internet when the internet was brand new to them at the time and they didn't know the dangers?There are legitimate things you can blame boomers for, but most of it is personal to you or me. For instance, my father became an internet addict when the internet came out and then he chose to do some really hurtful and damaging things on it, not realizing his son or wife could easily catch him. I can blame him for that... I can't blame him for being sold this novel toy called the internet, not fully appreciating the dangers of it, nor having the tools to combat those dangers if he actually was fully aware of it. I also can't blame my parents for the crap other people put on the internet.Social security wasn't the boomers, that was pre-WWII. And it's not like the boomers or that generation really had a much of say in how SS evolved from there, and it was sold to them as a good idea.A centralized bank was a terrible idea that has hurt us in many ways... that wasn't the boomers, that wasn't the "silent generation" (1925-1945), it was the G.I. Generation (1900-1924). If I recall though, that wasn't the G.I. Generation's fault, it was slipped into law by some lawmakers who more or less knew what they were doing.Civil rights did a lot of good, but it did a lot of damage to our education system. Not due to races integrating, but due to certain legal stipulations that have led to our schools getting dumbed down in many ways. That was the Silent gen, boomers, gen Xers... the 80's and 90's saw a lot of education reform that helped lead to colleges becoming as expensive as they are today. That was Gen Xers, boomers, the silent Gen. And a lot of millennials bought into that stuff and didn't pump the breaks on it as they became adults.If you are an adult now, think about how well you really know what is going on in the world... think about how well you really know about how your money works, how investments work, how the federal reserve works, how the whole system works... if you are anything like the typical adult, you are basically flying by the seat of your pants, you have a few things figured out, but you still don't know how it all works so you are operating largely on trust in the system.That is no different than the Gen Xers, the Boomers, and the Silent Gen.My point is that the older generations didn't screw anyone. They were born into a machine that was already moving.The sexual revolution was born out of the 40's... a horrible sociopath named Kinsey almost single-handedly ruined the American society with lies about human sexuality masked in the veneer of science. His methods were immoral and unscientific yet he faced little scrutiny and the world ate up his findings. Do you think it's the Boomer's fault that that happened? Do you think it's the Boomer's fault that they were peddled this idea that normal people have a lot more sex and experiment a lot more than anyone thinks? That is no more their fault than my generation being peddled all the junk food we were sold. And we can't entirely blame the junk food companies.The real people to blame tend to be faceless. They tend to not be the whole crowd, the whole generation... there are small numbers of instigators that cause the most trouble. Most of the blame the rest of us can really have is not being diligent enough and not being careful enough with all these new movements and technologies that come about and hurt us in ways we couldn't have seen at the time.EDIT: a few typos This is something we need to consider very deeply.There is a generational conflict brewing that is worse than it has been in a long time. The older generation needs to understand how they failed the younger, how they were not on guard enough and how they did not push their children enough on a familial level and societal level. There are of course many strong families out there, but there are so many that failed. And this is why young men are rightfully frustrated when older people tell them to just suck it up and be men.... the older generation largely failed in teaching the younger generation how to be men.The older generations need to understand that and this should weigh into how we legislate to some degree.That said, the younger generation needs to understand that the failures of the older generation were largely born out of a strange, post modern time. The sexual revolution had just happened, mass pop culture had just been invented... the allures of many bad behaviors captivated many, leading to sky rocketing divorce rates. Then the internet came along and no one knew how to protect against the dangers of that.Parents failed because no one before them knew how to handle these new situations and cultural phenomena.There needs to be a lot of forgiveness across the board. I think the idea stems from the section in 1 Corinthians (iirc) that states women should be quiet in church. This has led to all kinds of dogmatic applications and thoughts that women can't be leaders, and in this case that women can't even pray out loud... or perhaps the passage didn't *lead* to those thoughts but was used to justify those thoughts.... chicken or the egg.Anyway, the early church was constantly under attack by many things, one of which was just confusion as it grew within a polytheistic, mutlicultural world. New believers wouldn't just magically have all the answers, they would carry with them ideas that weren't Christian and were susceptible to bad ideas. There was an idea going around at the time that Eve was not the first one who committed sin. I imagine it was born out of a similar new feminist thinking that we see today that undermines the family, but that is just a guess. Again, chicken or the egg... Anyway, the epistle was speaking to that issue: that women should shut up about that false teaching that was going around. It wasn't an accurate narrative, spreading false teachings is a horrible thing to do, so the wording is understandably rather stern. Communism101 should be one post long, it should first say that it doesn't work, and then it should give some basic tenets about it so people can identify it when it is dressed up in a prettier package. Ownership and other concepts like it only as good as the society that enforces them. If your society stops protecting your right to life, liberty, and property, then you lose your freedom.The scary thing is that these concepts have been incrementally changing in our society, and leftists/socialists want to radically change them not realizing how much they've changed already. So they don't see that another more radical change is dangerous.Just because we have the power to change these things doesn't mean we should. So you think you should take their money and give it to people?Perhaps you missed my point. My point is that he is lying about not being a socialist. Why do you think it matters that there is an economic divide anyway? Back during the French Revolution there was an economic divide, too. Except back then, the poor paid virtually all the taxes. Today, the wealthy pay virtually all the taxes and the poorest pay next to nothing.Redistributing wealth is socialism. He is a socialist.This country already gives so much to the poor, you do not need to steal money from others to do more. You can get involved with your community. Government programs are all incredibly inefficient anyway.Every dollar that goes to the government only $.50 is used on the actual problem. Most charities give you about $.80-.90 on the dollar that go to the actual problem. And when I, a private citizen, give money or help to a person in need, 100% of my time and money goes to that person.>It also makes people think that he wants to have the government run everything, when really it'll still be private citizens starting and running businesses, and most of us will still just be working for a company, trying to get a paycheck.Again, when the government controls who you can hire, what you can make, and how you can do business (which socialized programs do), then you aren't really a private company. Again, in name, you own the company, but you do not make all the decisions, the government makes a large number of them for you. This is a very simple concept, but you are stuck on the technicality.Back in Nazi Germany, there were private business owners, too. Just because my name is the one on the piece of paper, doesn't mean I have control of it. Ownership is more than just a piece of paper. In a socialist state or in one where the government exerts as much control as Bernie would like to, the name on the piece of paper means less and less and the control the government has is more and more. At some point, the actual owner is the government even though on paper the company belongs to someone else. (edit: just for clarity, I'm not saying this is Nazi Germany at all, the point is that ownership is about whether or not the society actually fully recognizes ownership and what it means... if they don't care that you are the owner, they will just push through laws or coerce you to run your business as they want you to.)Again, you don't seem to understand ownership and how it actually works. A piece of paper doesn't make you the owner of something... a state the recognizes your ownership and protects it. If they don't do that, or if they don't recognize your authority over what you own, then you don't really own it. If I have a company but the government tells me more and more about what I can do and what I can't do, eventually they own the company for all intents and purposes... I'm just an investor and the government is making the decisions.Please think about this. Bernie Sanders' ideas are horrible. They will ruin the economy of not only the United States, but the world. The countries that have socialized medicine are greatly propped up by our help, our economy, our military, our trade, etc.All the problems you list are easily solvable:>And there are people that are in jail for robbery because they couldn't afford food. And there are people walking miles to work every day, because they don't have any other options. And to me, and many others, that just seems morally wrong.We have food stamps, we have private food charities, we have have soup kitchens, we have churches that give out food to all kinds of people, we have private businesses that donate food. If you steal for food, you are an idiot and deserve to be in prison except in the rarest of circumstances (in which case, the law is kinder than people think).If you can't afford shelter, there is affordable housing all over the place and programs that help you pay your rent. In many cases, homeless people can live free of charge in a real apartment. Many just choose not to.If you can't clothe yourself, there are so many options for you that are legal. There are so many charities.There is all kinds of medical care available that a lot of people just don't use, instead they go to ERs and waste tax payer money when they could go to a volunteer hospital and get very inexpensive to free care.There are all kinds of programs for education out there. Some of them are harder to find than others.All of these problems, society already has solutions for if you work and try to make them happen. When you get free things, you do not care for them as much. When you get donated things from a community of people who are volunteering and donating their time, money, and other goods, then you are more likely to care about what you received and use it to your benefit.There is also so much fraud in these government welfare programs as it is, there are people who live like kings and don't work at all. There are people who abuse food stamps and sell their food to shady restaurants for a profit. There are all kinds of ways people exploit the system and if you expand the system, more people will exploit it.These entitlement programs are all wasteful.Want more people to go to college and want to do it efficiently? How about you donate money to a charity that pays for college. Instead of $.50 on the dollar going to the student, $.90-.95 on the dollar would go to it and the student would be far more likely to take their education seriously.What you and Bernie want will lead to ruinEDIT: typos. I didn't say a candidate is looking to undo property taxes. That's not a federal tax anyway. I believe there is one state that does not face property taxes. That was merely to point out that your idea of ownership is faulty. If your ownership of your home is contingent on something, then you don't actually own it. This is important when talking about socialism or the shades of socialism that people seem to think exist.If toy believe he is or is not a socialist, then the idea of ownership is crucial to determining what is true. This idea that something is or is not socialism is a faulty one. It's like asking if China is or is not communist. We all know a "real communism" has never existed, so what is China? Is it communist-ish? Is it 90% communist?Let's further complicate it. Everyone talks about how communism is not a form of government, it is an economic system. This is not really true, it's only true when you mince words. Economic systems are informed by the government, and government systems are informed by economic systems. The economy and government are I inextricably linked. You cannot have a socialist system without a government that enforces that socialist system. Same with communism. Capitalism, on the other hand, exists no matter what. The black market takes over when the government exerts control. The free market, capitalist paradigm is the natural state, and if we protect it, it does wonders. Anyway, China is communist or something approaching yet it has pockets of capitalism as well as a black market. The point here is that it is exerting its power over it's entire market, it just takes it's boot of the neck of certain parts of it... but if it feels it needs to, it will put that boot right back on those markets.So this argument thar he is not a socialist is besides the point. A lot of people deny what they are. But with Bernie we know he wants to exert a lot of control over many aspects of the economy, including colleges, including health insurance and the surrounding markets like pharma, he wants to exert control over the tech industry. He is not asking for ownership of the means of production, but again, ownership is an intangible... even if I have a deed to a house, that doesn't mean I just magically own it. There are so many things home owners cannot do and if they do, then they are in violation of their ownership. There is a similar issue with computers these days... if I own an iPhone, I should be able to modify it, right? It's mine, I own it. But I sign away my right to modify my own property with my user agreements. The same is true for home ownership except those thing were forced upon people and are enforced by the government. A person selling a house doesn't force you to pay the property taxes, they don't force you abide by all the building codes.... that's the government.So I'm willing to say that socialism is not when the government forces certain rules on private industry. But there comes a point when there is so much control exerted over the industry that the government effectively owns the means of production without actually taking control over it.So he claims he is not socialist. That is a mincing of words. When you exert as much control over the means of production as a government that Bernie wants to, then the government is the owner. He can only say he's not socialist based on a technicality. He is not asking universities to sign over their ownership to the government, he does not need to, he can force legislation through that eliminates their self governance, and in doing so, it, in essence, is the state's.Further, this idea that only a handful of people control all the money is a weird idea. Do you know how companies work? They don't operate without people. So much of the worth of Bill Gates is tied into employees, facilities, investments, etc. Anyway, if someone wishes to just usurp other people's money, their money is literally producing more money. Their money is literally a means of production, and Bernie wants to take control of it. Yes, by exerting control over the means of production.You have to ask yourself what ownership means. When you own a home but do not pay your property taxes, your home can legally be taken away from you. Taxes become rent, and the state becomes the owner who merely leases the property to you. Property taxes in essence say that the government owns all the property. It's called a tax, but the effect is a soft government ownership, the terms of which can be changed at any time. Usually when you own something, you know, it's yours.Exerting control over private industry at the scale Sanders wishes to is taking over the means of production even if no ownership is actually signed over. This is stupid. Kim Jong Un and Putin are literally dictators. One is allied with China, keeps testing nukes, has prison camps, and has missiles pointed ar Seoul constantly. The other has taken Crimea in recent years, meddled in elections, has massive control over his entire government, and has had his own people killed.Saying Trump is the biggest threat to world peace is silly. It's like saying the sheriff is going to make the outlaws mad so the sheriff is the biggest threat to stability, meanwhile the outlaws go on killing and stealing and raping. But these things Obama did are truly horrible. Pretty much anything Trump has done in comparison is not even close to warranting the ire he has drawn from the left. Even when you take some of what the OP listed as an interpretation of the facts what Obama has done is fucking scary and we are all sitting over here wondering when you guys will see it.I appreciate your point because it is true, if Trump does wrong, we should not deflect by looking at Obama, however, that is not what we are doing. You are being told that what Trump did is worthy of impeachment, we are trying to simply temper your perspective and show you that what you are being fed is dishonest. We are willing to call out Trump for what he has done wrong, but he has literally committed no crime in office so we can't really call him out on anything other than maybe being censured for doing something all presidents do. This ends up making your point a deflection. You do not intend to deflect but it is a natural response when you learn the guy you backed was actually pretty shitty.Imagine you have a murderer and a petty thief standing before you and deciding their fate. You are the judge handing out the sentences. To the thief you give a fine, order them to apologize and to pay back their debt to the person. they stole from, and you give them a stern warning to never do it again. And while this man has an abrasive character and has made some immoral decisions, you feel he is attempting to do right by the people he cares for.Then the murderer stands before you, clearly the worse of the two criminals. He's a smooth talker and people like his personality... he's a cool guy. But he murdered someone, not only that but he stole from that person and has a bunch of minor crimes tied to him with no convictions. He is finally caught and condemned, his is just awaiting your sentence. You give him the maximum sentence for his crimes based on the crime and his behavior before the murder.The murderer says to you "but why did the thief only get a fine?!?! You are clearly a partial judge! That is totally unfair!"The audacity of that comment to you makes you laugh as you have him removed from the court. He was merely deflecting as a final shot to try and salvage his pride and maybe even try to intimidate the judge into lightening his sentence.So when people say "just because one person did something wrong, doesnt mean we shouldn't punish other wrong doing" we laugh. I'm happy to call out Trump when he does something wrong and I and people in these subs do all the time. None of his behaviors warrant kicking him out of the office. Imagine being so triggered you have to subscribe to all the conservative subs, including ones that are clearly only for conservatives and then troll them. It was aleady ruined. This would be like making the pile of rubble the place where everyone takes their dogs to piss and defecate. Oh my god, people on here said any criticisms of Obama were a modern day lynching. They call Trump literally a Nazi worse than Hitler and you want to complain about some analogies made to make a point? The pinnacle? Some bacteria developed on a planet that's going nowhere and to you its not fair game because we are arrogant? Only completely dead planets are okay? This isn't Star Trek.Do you realize how many living things died for your life already? Do you fall to your knees and ask God to forgive you of your hubris every time? No, because that is silly. I mean let's not pull an Avatar with sentient life, but ffs, if we find bacteria on Mars, who cares? Collect it, test it for medicinal properties, and cultivate it if it does. Otherwise gtfo, bacteria. Nah man, this goes deeper. It's looking like a money laundering scheme. And that's just part of it. You mean like the irony of saying no one is above the law, giving hunter Biden a pass (who is looking guiltier and guiltier each day) meanwhile condemning trump who had committed no crimes according to the inquiry.By the way, saying it would be stupid for someone to do something when they haven't done it is actually stupid. Do you see the irony there? Don't answer, let it sink in.EDIT: mobile typo Tom Morello is a bitch. And arrogant. There was the story from 5 years ago about him treating people at a bar like shit, then he tweeted a complaint and the bar owner wrecked him.When you put music out there, you never know who is going to like it. If you can't handle that, get out of the business. Or you could decide not to assume the absolute worst sentiment of the person you are speaking with. I expected people to read it without assuming the worst, but I should have expected someone like you to do just that.That's one of the ways being decent is done, simply not assuming the worst of people... avoiding passive aggressive crap is good, too.Take care. Ugh, good lord.I meant the attention the world is giving her. You people are exhausting. She'll be worth millions when this is through. These and many tricks like them are used so much that it's become a style, so to speak. A lot of people arguing with these tactics don't even seem to know they are doing it. Many do but don't seem to see it as dishonest. The ones who don't realize tend to just be regurgitating the fallacious argument as they heard it elsewhere. And the worst are obviously those who do it and are fully aware of what they're doing. Right, I read the title and was thinking "you don't want them to lay off teachers but these guys also helped cause the problem." There are some hard choices that will need to be made, layoffs may need to be part of it. While concentration camps are appalling there is a very different issue with Muslims. Jews in Europe prior to the Final Solution weren't committing acts of terrorism. While there are so many non-radical Muslims, there are large numbers of them who believe in instituting Sharia law whether the country they are in accepts it or not. I am not defending the actions of India or China at all, I am merely stating there is a difference we should note.How do you handle a populace that is unwilling to abide by the rules of your country?Personally, I think you need to bolster your judicial system and convict those who break the law, and that would handle most of the problem with radical Muslims (not that there aren't other kinds of radicals out there, we are talking about Muslim populations though). But that is also a slow process.So when I see countries like China throwing Muslims in these camps, it alarms me and disturbs me, but not in the same way as when the Nazi's did it.There were legit stories in New York of Muslim patrol cars patrolling areas of Brooklyn (iirc) making sure people were behaving as per Muslim law. This went beyond community policing like when volunteer citizens patrol and call the cops... these patrols took law into their own hands. While these stories are fairly rare in New York, they are happening more, especially over seas. You can't have rule of law if you allow private citizens to institute their own rules and enforce them extrajudicially. This is the side of radical Islam that people don't talk about... these aren't terrorists doing these things, but what they are doing is disturbing and undermining our rule of law.How do you deal with that? Again, I think we use the court system, but if you let in a ton of people who might do this, that system will get clogged up fast.India and China are not doing it right at all. But the problem that their action high lights is one more countries are going to have to face. It seems new because people only know the broad brush strokes of history. When you look closer things havent changed You are simply wrong on this. There are all kinds of stories from the past of stupid arguments and sleeping around and the post master general confiscating adulterous love letters. It's always been this way.EDIT: it has... not sure why this is contraversial. You cite wikipedia.... which cites James Comey... come on. Comey? No one trusts Comey anymore, that guy made the FBI a joke, which is incredibly unfortunate because there are great people there.To address your accusations about voter suppression, that is laughable.The media has skewed left since the 60s and has slowly pushed more so as the decades went on. Fox news was a correction to the course they were the new guys on the block offering a different take when the original 3 major networks all slowly pulled left. Why would the GOP want to suppress the black vote when they have risen to 33% in support of Trump? You kinda need a motive, and you don't.Not only that but if you are a person who claims that requiring only legal citizens be allowed to vote is "voter suppression" then you being dishonest.To go back to the news though, which you all seem to forget the history of, something like 90% of reporters are registered Democrats and you think somehow the right is suppressing them? Are you serious? You have no idea how biased the media is against conservatives and how subtly they do it, so when you see an answer to it you think it's some kind of attack or something. I mean NBC literally fed Hillary questions before debates and you are acting like the right is the one with some kind of strange media strangle hold? Really?It's insane. Putting a veil over my eyes? Okay... He has also lost money since becoming president. And you immediately take the side of the contractors when we all know that while there are many great contractors out there, there are so many horror stories that we all feel nervous trusting them.Most politicians make their millions after becoming politicians, begging the question: how?Trump lost money. You don't have to like the guy at all, but let's be honest.It's so strange what is happening. Some of the behavior from the left is exactly what I see in teenagers. You have a group of boys, they're all puffing their chests, talking about stuff they're great at. Johnny says he has really great grades, but his friends don't believe him and tell him to prove it. Some of his friends get bad grades, some are overly competitive...and no one else is being asked to prove anything in this game, so he declines. The rest of the boys say he's lying and they even get angry at him when it didnt even matter in the first place. Now the rest latch onto it as if Johnny is hiding something when the truth is just that the way these guys are acting, even if he is right, revealing his grades won't help and they are being so insane about their distrust of him that he doesn't want to acquiesce to their demands. So he doesn't. They hold it against him for months.This is what the left did with the Trump tax returns. They don't matter so long as they have been reviewed and the law was followed, which you can be sure the IRS would watch considering Obama used them to target conservatives. And yet it is still a sore spot for the left, it is a sure sign of dishonesty. Trump gains nothing from making them public, you won't be happy with it if he does even if they are squeaky clean. Why would he just acquiesce to bullies?Meanwhile you have all these politicians, including some very prominent ones on the left, who have made millions after becoming politicians. What is more suspicious? A dude becoming a politicians and losing money, or a dude becoming a politician and a few years later becoming worth millions? The end of democracy? How?Are we no longer going to have elections? No more representative government? We've never had a democracy, by the way. We have a democratic Republic... and frankly that's not even entirely accurate. But is Trunp the end of what we have?But to stop splitting hairs about the kind of government we have, when you can vote out what you perceive as a threat to democracy, it's not a threat to democracy.You just don't like what he is doing and calling it the end of democracy. The irony is that that kind rhetoric foments insane amounts of anger that actually might help end what we have.What would be a threat to democracy by the president would be doing something like using the IRS to target politically oppositional groups and audit them, slowing them down, costing them money, etc. Sounds like something Trump would do, right? Sounds like a horrible abuse of power, right? Guess who did that... Obama.This is why your rhetoric is terrible. The right is watching this and seeing how massively hypocritical it is. And the right doesn't blame all of you, they are also terrified because the media hasn't informed you about this stuff. They don't report it when the left does it, but they go nuts at any hint of the right maybe possibly sorta kinda doing something. And people such as yourself eat it up and start acting just as they want you to. They want you to be upset and angry because they don't have the facts to back up their claims. I'm not concerned with your rejection of my apology. I apologized for what I regretted, and clarified what I didn't. Perhaps it wasn't as gracious as it could have been, but we are splitting hairs here so detail is important.People are naturally offended when their beliefs are criticized. I apparently struck a cord with with you by calling you an agnostic, but that is what you are.I didn't intend to condescend, I think you just read that into what I said. I've done that, too.At any rate, I understand you blocked me. That is fair. I've blocked people, too. But usually only those who are actually rude and persist in their rudeness and are far more snide and petty than I could be perceived to have been. Truth be told, I disabled inbox replies to my last comment, and wouldn't have seen this, but I was reading through my history and got curious.Normally I wouldn't reply. But I have not been condescending or rude. What arguably is condescending and arrogant is to argue from a paradigm that is designed to be beyond reproach set above all others out of practicality in knowledge, but not because it is the soul arbiter of knowledge.I would once again refer to my people-living-in-a-box analogy. Your paradigm is good for what is contained within the system contained within the box, but if there is something beyond the box, it has no explanatory power, nor does it have the tools to adequately study it. Nor does it necessarily have the capacity to even collect data on it. If what is beyond the box interacts with us in a way we can't measure by your paradigm, then to you it doesn't exist.Assuming it doesn't exist until there is proof of it is certainly a productive approach, but it is obviously built on assumptions that make it weaker than anyone in your paradigm would like to admit. They act as if it is both more and less than it is. And so it is beyond reproach in the eyes of many, while it is full of holes. Ladies and gentlemen, please report the trolls, do not feed them. The problem with your inane, foolish argument here is that people can be rallied to all kinds of stupid things. PokemonGo, movie castings they don't like, sales on electronics, seeing a big stupid ball drop while you are stuck in times square barely able to move, going to see Hitler speak.Her argument is all emotion with very little in the way of valid reasoning. She is also not sacrificing anything, she will be wealthy the rest of her life because of this. She is not doing any of the actual clean up herself, she is just whining and making people angry at those who think her legislative ideas are terrible. Meanwhile, real people are making real gains.All she has accomplished is being a shill. I pity her and I think her family is terrible. Just to clarify, it sounds like you are saying that her autism and her age act as a sort of force field and lightening rod. People will defend her seemingly to the death because she is a teen with a disability, and they will attack those who criticize her message or her hypocrisy or anything about her with the rage of a mother lion protecting her cubs because of her age and disability (and the fact they agree with her awful message). Could you respect that this sub isn't for you? Ok, Greta. She is preaching to the choir. She is accomplishing nothing except fomenting anger. No, they were murdered by their enemies. Also I think your number is off.What you used is a figure of speech, it is not accurate, and yet you are saying it is. Yes! John Portman "A Life of Building" it was called. That may be, the doc was about a white guy though. This is what it is. They know very angry people here hate Trump and are overly suspicious of him. They are getting them amped up. That is all this is. Nah, it was a white guy iirc. For the record, I have been saying this for something like 3 years now. Haha...  oh it sucks being right all the time. There was a great PBS documentary on architecture in China. There is a rather prolific American architect who has done a lot of work there. I forget his name now and it's been years since I've seen it, so I'll try to find it.... but the architecture is absolutely stunning, and the interiors are some of the most beautiful I have ever seen. Just a giant floating vagina that speaks. This doesnt wcen logically flow from what I said ad an ad hominem.You should think your attacks through a little more than this. And yet you must accept him. Reality is funny that way. He was duly elected, that is reality. You should accept reality. I have. You should, too, and you should stop with the ad hominem attacks to avoid a point. So then why were there those who helped them and tried to civilize them. I agree intent matters so you should apply that rationally. The entire press room hates Trump. Are you kidding?This article is stupid. Nope, it was far more complex. You don't just get to label something in simple ways like this because you want to.We have clear examples of genocides to draw from, this doesn't not fit those patterns. Simple minded is calling it a genocide and leaving it at that. I was obviously adding nuance to it.And to correct you, it wasn't mostly theft, swindling, betrayal, and murder. It was mostly disease. It wasn't a genocide. It was a war. Not our proudest moment at all but not a genocide.The reason people call it a genocide is because so many Natives died in general, but most of the deaths were not at the hands of Europeans or Americans. The biggest cause of death was plague that happened simply as a result of Europeans coming over. Natives hadn't developed any sort of immunity to things like Small Pox, so when Europeans came over, disease killed like 50% of their population. Remember how many people died during the black plague in Europe? Plagues hit the Natives hard, too.Beyond that, there were complex relationships between natives and Europeans. Some tribes were friendly, some were brutal bullies. Some of the friendly ones worked with the Europeans, the brutal bullies fought those tribes friendly to the Europeans and the Europeans themselves.A genocide doesn't operate like that.Further, there were a significant number of Europeans and Americans killed. Again, that doesn't happen in a genocide.Also, they weren't slaughtered simply because of their race, their creed, or their skin. That is what a genocide is about, the natives were largely killed by disease and war.Many of the Europeans and later the Americans wanted to help the natives and civilize them spreading the prosperity of the west to them. It wasn't handled well at all, but that was largely the desire.Finally, to put this all on the US is silly also because the French, British, Spanish, etc. So who gets all the blame? Do you want to put that all on the US? Because we didn't even exist when that began. As far as land mass, the British colonies were relatively small compared to what the French had.It was not a genocide. It was a mix of many factors, the largest simply being disease.EDIT: come mobile typos Ok, look at the testimony. You have nothing. Just because you want it doesn't mean it exists.Did you hear Schiff and his shakedown "allegory"? That is all you have: wishful thinking and anger that Hillary lost a fair election. So because a dude made a mistake about how impeachment works,  they are influenced by Russian propaganda.The real influence Russia had was not what you think it was. They got into your heads with paranoia more than any ad on facebook got into the heads of some in the right. This is evident by your baseless accusation against a person who simply misunderstands the process.Seattle down. Impeachment doesnt require an illegal action, but the intent of it is that the act ought to be bad enough to dismantle a duly elected president.Your second assertion requires a proof of intent and real item of value to be true. You have neither if you have listened to the testimony of the people being questioned. You are treating what you think happened as fact.Take care. Nothing, they keep making up terms that sound bad but are not actually charges.There were some not smart things Trump has done, but none that are illegal. They even have people on record saying the Steele Dossier was completely fabricated and that that was the entire basis for the original investigation. The Ukraine thing is just more of that, presidents do what he did all the time... doesn'tmake it right but it doesn't make it illegal either.It really seems like the Dems just want him out of office by any means necessary and don't think they can win the election. So they are getting their base riled up with ideas that something illegal really happened when there is no evidence and everyone admits there is no evidence except for people on reddit who are acting like that meme of Charlie from It's Always Sunny. Schiff and Pelosi should be voted out or resign based on the crap they have been pulling and making their contingents think there is something there when there isn't.It's like if I want you gone from reddit and I know you didn't do anything illegal, the worst I have is you cross posted when you shouldn't have, but then I go and tell everyone you committed a cross post quid pro quo, it sounds more weighty but it doesn't technically mean anything. It certainly doesn't mean you should be kicked off of reddit, maybe you shouldn't have done the cross post because it's looked down upon but there is no real rule that says you can't and all the rules about it really have to do with, say, if you were cross posting and taking credit for the content or something, which you didn't do.I mean Bill Clinton shouldn't have been impeached but he actually committed perjury which is a real crime. Trump did not, people just really don't like him.And keep in mind, this high standard for presidents is kind of new. Everyone knew Kennedy cheated with Marilyn Monroe. Heck some of the founding fathers said some terrible things about each other. Unflattering behavior in the presidency isn't new. There is a natural hierarchy but that is not a good reason to be happy or upset with the system.Focus more on the actions of individuals. People do not appreciate free stuff and we cannot guarantee that they will use it to the potential we would like.Even students who take massive loans to go to school can waste the opportunity, so imagine when there is nothing to lose if you don't fully appreciate the opportunity of free schooling. You are misinformed about the gospels being the only source. They are the most detailed source, certainly, but there are ancient historians that corroborate at least the Jesus existed, had followers, and was believed to be a messiah who performed miracles. These sources are trustworthy for many reasons. They do not corroborate the miracles of Christ but they bring more credence to the texts by corroborating many details in the Gospels. Perhaps you aren't aware of the sources, but they exist and so your claim that there are no other texts besides the gospels is erroneous.Secondly, I am sorry I upset you with my labeling you. To be honest though, I am not going to take it back. I will not concede that as spade is not a spade because it is upsetting to the spade and because that spade is gifted at arguing.You have a curiosity that is healthy and welcome in the face of an authoritarian New Atheism that is not healthy nor logical, but the paradigm you are asserting is not the only one that has worth, nor is it the only one based in logic.Take care. I understand the distinction you make. You are simply an agnostic.There are a lot of semantic games people play that bleed into the discourse and lead to needless confusion. Atheist, agnostic, and theist are more than adequate descriptors. There was a rather popular diagram of the four basic stances as you seem to subscribe, the problem was that one of the four was logically redundant leaving the three basic stances I listed. As far as your issue with the word of faith, it is the rather common New Atheist argument that we are committing blind faith. The argument is not fair and poisons the well against all people of a faith. Certainly there are those who have an impetuous and thoughtless faith. This is not the norm yet atheists tend to unfairly frame the debate that way and then claim that all faith must be blind.Except if I trust the character of someone based on what I'm told of them and I choose to trust that they will pick me up because I was told they would, that is faith in their character and that they will do what they say. That isn't blind faith, it is based on my judgment of that person who told me about them.The Greek word that is most translated as "faith" in the Bible is more associated with the concept of "trust". This is important because while the terms are roughly synonymous, faith has a supernatural or spiritual connotation as if it derives from some kind of mystery or esoteric knowledge. But all Christians are doing is trusting the testimony of the writers of the Bible as you would trust any historical document that had many many verifiable facts while also having some unverifiable facts. We trust the unverifiable based on the verifiable, which includes more than just geographical accuracy. It also includes things such as archeological studies into how texts were copied at the time or how knowledge was documented, to name just a couple things. We can't verify everything that texts say about Alexander the Great, but if we can verify some of what the texts say then we tend to trust the rest of them. If you can verify who wrote the specific text and have information on how trustworthy they are, then you continue to increase your justification in trusting the text. There are many reasons why the writers of the Bible appear to be trustworthy. That isn't faith in a supernatural sense, nor is it blind. That is basic human reasoning "if components x, y, and z are true, then text A is more likely to be trustworthy as a whole".... obviously the more components, the greater the odds.Just because you think some claims in the Bible are difficult to believe doesn't mean trusting it is entirely unreasonable. Trusting the Bible isn't blind faith in the overall claim, it is trust based on various verifiable facts that give credence to the text. We look past the more difficult to believe aspects trusting many things, such as the possibility that our interpretation of those confusing aspects of the text or the translation may be off.When you read a complex text, you don't always understand or get every piece in the moment, but you trust that whatever it was that confused you makes sense with some further investigation. That isn't blind faith,  that is trust in the rest of the text and confidence that the confusing parts will be made plain to you at some point in the future. Scientists do this with data and models all the time. They create a model trusting that the holes will be filled. This is normal in the discovery process in both science and religion. Why it is strange in one context and not the other is a double standard that New Atheists especially do not see. I didnt say it was iron clad reasoning.You know this is about trust right?The thing about arguing to an atheist is that an atheist is already setting the ground rules for discussion. They will not accept arguments that do not align with the specific paradigm of the scientific method. But we haven't even proved that objective reality is real, so the grounds that the atheist walks on are flimsy from the beginning.Further, an atheist claims something doesn't exist before knowing that the case. Agnosticism is a tenable position. Atheism is not.If you are looking to be convinced in your paradigm, you never will be. There are things beyond our experience that we do not and cannot know, even if there is no spiritual element, there are things we cannot know because we do not know the bounds of existence nor if there is anything beyond that. What an atheist does is assume there is nothing, but they often conflate that assumption with an assertion that there is nothing. You cannot make that assertion because you don't even know the bounds of the universe yet, so how can you possibly argue whether it is improbable that a God like being existing?What so many atheists do would be like a flat earther saying "what is the best argument that says the earth is round?" And then they sit there and deny all the arguments because one argument could swing either way, another argument might be weak, and another just doesn't fit their paradigm.There are prophecies in the Bible that certainly seem trustworthy based on the evidence we have. Verifiable? No. These aren't scientific endeavors, we cannot recreate a miracle to study it. So we use what we argue is trustworthy and then simply choose to have faith in it. If you hear there is a sale on computers somewhere but you have no solid evidence there is a sale, you go in faith the store assuming the sale will be there, you trust what you heard. That is what Christians do, we trust, we don't have some kind of magical knowledge. We do seem to have trustworthy reports of supernatural experiences, but obviously we can't reproduce those because if they exist, they are reliant on whether or not God will perform them and whether there is a choice we are making that prevents it from happening. This assumes the free will position of most Christians which posits that we have choice and because God allows us that freedom, He must hold that ideal so high that He will not defy our choice, which is essentially why suffering happened in the first place according to Genesis).Imagine an being locked in a box unable to see anything beyond the box with no idea of what could be beyond that box. This being has a concept of God that is somehow beyond the box but cannot really understand how it exists beyond the box. There is a second being in the box and this one asks the first one, "what is your most convincing evidence? But only put it in terms of existence within the box." That is an impossible task.The other issue with trying to prove God under your paradigm is that you are forced to do so with even us Christians and Jews not fully understanding the nature of God.So you can take that as us being blind and having no evidence, that us fine. However there is evidence, it is just not necessarily up to the standards of repeatable as the scientific method requires.And consider this lastly, this is primarily how you understand life. You don't walk around not doing anything because there isn't a repeatable experiment that covers everything you think and do. You trust that reality is real even though you can't prove it is, yet you wish Christians to prove God is real? We can't prove reality is real with any scientific experiment. How could we even prove God is real if we can't even prove reality is real?I don't think atheists realize how they naturally assert a double standard.Again, agnosticism is the far more tenable position. You aren't speaking I'll of him when you are saying he is part of the swamp? Ok. Look at the side bar. I will give you the same warning I gave someone else. You are not privy to all the information the president is. Assuming he backed off out of cowardice is not fair and breaks our rule 11. It is very likely he found it prudent to back off for many reasons. Hillary is not well. Please observe our rule 11. You are not privy to all the reasons why our president or any of our political leaders choose what they do.  But here you assume the reason is being a coward. That is not a fair assessment. Please do not do that. I made my first painting a few weeks ago. It's some Bob Ross wannabe crap. What you did is amazing and makes me feel pathetic haha.  Good work! What convinced me was how faithfully that which the Bible claims is good is attacked, undermined, and destroyed through direct or indirect means. Not only that but the abject evil by which some of this has been asserted.For instance, the sexual revolution was born out of the insane, unscientific, falsified data of a strange sex "researcher" who consorted with pedophiles, using "data" that they provided, as well as corresponding with Nazi scientists, and then published his research with pro-life saying it up despite clear issues with his moral behavior as well as his research methods. His name was Alfred Kinsey, and Hollywood adores him, but they white wash his past and his principles and his behaviors.His work has led to the normalization of porn which is crippling our men, destroying marriages and families and leading to a far weaker society.The Bible teaches about the strength of the family, it shows in detail the value of it and why it works. It shows how the family unit, when forged properly is one of the strongest social units that makes it very hard for powers large and small to harm the well being of the family.When you look at all the things that have harmed the family, like the sexual revolution... you start to wonder if maybe the world is out to get these ideas, that maybe the world does want Judeo-Christian ideals to die.Look at the hate against Israel. Historically their people have been brutalized and hated largely because they maintained their families, worked to help themselves within their families, and generally had their shit together. Before WWII, the culture of the Jews was such that they could survive through depressions in relative comfort because they planned for drought (so to speak). So when the great depression hit, so many German's saw the Jews doing okay and started getting irrationally angry at them, literally accusing them of insane conspiracy theories. All they were really doing was being faithful and planning ahead. This is obviously a generalization, but these more orthodox Jews did just this.Then they were slaughtered.And had the US not entered the fight when they did, had Japan held off on their attack, Germany might have won it all and destroyed all the Jews or the face of the earth. This is exactly what the enemy in the Bible wants. If there is new Israel, there is no God, there is no salvation, there is now covenant... no Israel means God failed, and yet here Israel is.There are prophecies about Israel and their flower production. Israel has a huge flower industry and Israel didnt exist as a country until 80 years ago.So I have come to belief in God based on seeing how the world works against what God stands for and then seeing how what God stands for miraculously survives.Christianity itself sort of bottlenecked soon after Jesus, and then boom, it was the religion of the known world (at least a bastardized version of it, though that allowed the original faith to survive as well). I don't know. But business is booming and I know I saved money on my taxes. If you look for doom and gloom in everything that is what you will find.And the worst part about that is you will bring others down with you. And then you vote for people who think that way. And then the economy tanks because of policies that impose massive taxes.It seems overly simple because it is.Good luck in your grief. What? This is how a healthy system is supposed to work. The headline makes it sound like this is an odd thing. Different branches, it turns out, have different authorities and work somewhat (though not entirely) independently of each other. The threat was real. The paranoia was actually somewhat justifiable, it was just carried out so poorly. (Edit: the investigations into Soviet infiltration, that is).The people that carried out the soviet's plans were those that they suppressed over there. By making enemies of Hollywood, McCarthy emboldened them and gave them more support to pursue and publish anti-western ideas that went unchecked. The arts naturally subvert, and so emboldening the arts (particular a form of art that is incredibly powerful) made it hard to keep those ideas in check within the natural order. They didn't need to send spies to subvert, our own culture did it. They just made a few key moves here and there and them they mostly waited.The natural desire is communism, the natural desire is that someone saves us and gives us what we need, and the natural savior seems to be communism as it acts as this sort of savior that gives you what you need. It sort of imposes itself as a false Christ-like government, seemingly equally and free from burdens that force us to toil and fend for ourselves.But Christ actually came with some rather upsetting news, that life is and will be hard and that we need to work hard and probably end up suffering despite our efforts. The good news is that God rewards this faithful adherence to His will. He give such countries prosperity where as communisms undoubtedly fail and destroy.Communism is selfish, capitalism is working and earning for the self. Some may cheat the capitalist system and act selfishly, but that is a sign that the system is just, it is a sign that people will not act in the best interest of others, only the best interest of the self. So pretending as if you can force the opposite, that you can decide to form a collective that works for the greater good when we all are cursed to see things for ourselves, is folly. That system requires a heavy heavy hand to make people do what is so unnatural.The other system has a heavy hand at work, too. But it doesn't loom nearly as large. Yeah, but the top comment acts like this is somehow proof tax cuts don't help. Meanwhile the job market added,what, like 250k jobs or something?AT&T's business is primarily cellphone, cable TV, and fiber optic internet service. Cellphone competition has really opened up in the past 6-7 years, and people are cutting cable in droves. Somehow that means tax cuts are bad. Ok, but the job market tho. We added thousands upon thousands of jobs. And you're acting like one company who made mistakes and is also losing because competition against it's cell service and cable services is strong is somehow indicative of tax cuts being bad.Come on, folks. This headline is ridiculous. Hmm, okay. Those stories were not told in full. There was a child who was brought in here with a serious illness. It died as a result of the illness that was made worse by a family who took it illegally across the border, weathering the elements and such. You took advantage, and now you do not. You are forgiven.Please don't conflate your bad behavior with the good. Im glad you are contributing to society that is a great thing. But your argument here is a bit like a thief using his stolen money to start a legitimate business.I'm happy to have you as a citizen, but I'm not going to pretend that your means of becoming one was fair or right, though I know it can be complicated as well. We believe in forgiveness in this country. That doesnt mean we let people take advantage. You are dishonest.And to answer your absurdly condescending question: you don't recall how this state has been controlled by Democrats forever, including downstate Democrats who this whole sub admits has a large impact on upstate? You don't remember how that has led to a New York state that, despite boasting the greatest city in the world, has the worst growth rate in the country, which means people are leaving in droves? You don't remember that? Who did all that, because as far as I'm aware this state and the major cities in it have been blue for a long time.So don't play coy and dont pretend that one side is worse than the other because you are being short sighted and foolish, and you cover it up with this condescending behavior like a teenage boy trying to puff his chest. It's two angled cuts happening at the same time. One blade is set at -45 degrees and the other ad -135 degrees. You can look at them as creating a single angle between themselves, but it's two blades creating two cuts. Hmm... remember when one side has controlled the entire state for decades. Remember when* both sides have controlled the city for decades and let it die?Don't pretend it isn't true because you found a couple things to be pissed about. I see what you did there.... you're not helping. I think this is also a bit of a stretch. The laws exist for everyone, but obviously the rich and powerful have a greater capacity to hide or get out of their illegal activity.There are also other forces at work... imagine the Prime Minister getting caught doing something as terrible as helping Epstein human traffic as well as being involves sexually with underage girls. These things can be incredibly destabilizing, especially when we have enemies like China and Russia to contend with, groups who would love to destabilize the West.When you get this high up and see this kind of corruption, national security effects weigh into things, and while justice should be higher up on our priorities, sometimes the damage caused by something can be so severe that the dearabilization it leads to prevents all our justice from being served because there is literally no rule of law anymore. Breaking down? Let's see how this plays out. There are a lot of moving parts and justice can be slow. Fair distinction, but at the same time they spun downstate's effect on upstate schools as death by a thousand cuts, as if the budget issue up here was the result of it. Perhaps no one act downstate was to blame (in their argument) but it seems they felt the blame was at least in part downstate's, so much that they petitioned to make downstate solve the problem. And that was remedied.... what is your point I didnt equate them. But any government program that asserts authority that is supposedly in the name of the people usually end up not working for the people. You dont get the point. Social programs are another mass of power that often don't work for the people. As if the dems don't pull this either... Stop living in this bubble where you think one is worse than the other. Just yesterday there was, it was about the RCSD budget. They blamed the down state folks for the budget shortfall. And I'm not even saying they were entirely wrong, but this extreme rhetoric is disturbing. This is kind of weird because just yesterday was a post supported by most people here that literally blamed New York City for the budget problem with the RCSD... and most of the people here are not Republicans.Can we stop with the extreme partisan rhetoric and the demonization of people you don't agree with? The nazi government was supposed to work for the people. China's government is supposed to work for the people.This is silly reasoning you have. Evil dictators are supposed to work for their people. They don't. This is why you should oppose these concentrations of power.This is why the country began. We would all like to be as charitable as possible and make everyone happy, but when that is the focus rather than having the government do the only things it is good at (protecting us and enforcing our laws) then you leave your country open to tyranny. And it might not be immediately, one step closer might not suddenly leave you falling down into fascism, but it brings us ever closer.Consolidation of power is a desire that we all have that must be constantly guarded against. Lord of The Rings is a perfect allegory for this concept. This is the most dangerous form of censorship, this subtle way that things just sort of cease to exist because they are not covered.I agree that the wire services are good, but I'm more worried about that sort of soft censorship than the out right lies a lot of outlets tell. You guys really to hear The Rubin Report with Ajit Pai. I imagine the number is much higher when you include those who just aren't quiet about their feelings from time to time but do not rant. Hmm, ok.You are arguing rather rudely whereas I was just trying to have a conversation.So I'll leave you to your thoughts. Take care. So the money really isn't owed, the state is just shitty. Which makes the petition misleading, though the situation is certainly unfair. As for the superintendent and my comment about not rewarding bad behavior, it's still true. But I will add to it. Schools across the board are spending on things that are not essential to learning and don't actually help. Not only that but state laws, as well as some federal laws, are making this all very difficult for many schools.The voters hear about technology and new approaches to learning, these things cost a ton of money, but when they are tested they are done so in isolation. But then they force them into a local system that isn't as simple as where they were tested.Basically all schools and voters are part of this bad behavior that elevates the new and exciting approaches with new technology and such, meanwhile they are losing on the basics. Students are more unprepared for college than ever.... why? For a lot of reasons. But largely because the schools have their hands tied behind their backs on so many issues and because people see all these nice shiny new things.If we simply spent on the basics, stopped promising more than is deliverable, and start being honest about the role of parents in ALL,schools, we will come away with much more realistic expectations.All schools are struggling with this tension between what they can actually do without parents really backing them (for many reasons, most are no one's fault), and what is expected.Computers don't really help a school whose main problem is fatherless homes and a lack of parents at home who can support. Or I should specify, it might help, but only incrementally. So where should the community support go? Should we dump money into technology that only does a little bit? Should we hire more and more paras? They are often great but you kinda just get what you get and really paras aren't that effective except to help mitigate the problems with students who might not do well in the general ed setting.It's a tough question.... we have so many parents with kids in city schools who simply can't support, but we have this belief more TAs and more computers, and smart boards and better teachers will pick up the slack.You can lead a horse to water but you can't make them drink. You can buy the most talented teacher in the world, but if the kids don't work with them and the parents don't support them, then you've just hired a babysitter.Unfortunately, more money won't really fix this in the schools. Some kind of other community support needs to happen that helps parents fill in the gaps in their own lives. How that looks, I'm not sure. Is there anything that actually validates the claim that the school is simply owed money? It sounds like a reach at this point.Not trying to rain on anyone's parade here, but based on what I've read, this sounds like wishful thinking. It sounds like calculations were made, an idea of what was coming was made, and then the reality was different. I mean correct me if I'm wrong.Also, I don't really think we should be rewarding the district. They admit they over spent. I mean toss them a bone to stay alive... but $111 million? They are not doing what they need to do, they are not spending it properly, so why give them more? Agreed. But we also have to pick our own battles. I would hope our folks do what must be done, but they also see some things we don't. So I try not to judge harshly if they don't do what I expect. There may be a lot of dirty laundry to air out. I like this strategy too and I think Republicans would easily come out on top, but there may be casualties. So perhaps they are hesitant. We like to know how the government is screwing us. I love the narrative you tell with this poem. You build your story out of these snapshots and create a verbal montage.I do find the amount of repetition dulls those beautiful snapshots you created. I was just toying with it a little and I wondered if maybe you only repeat "The most obviously lie" every fourth line, or maybe every other... or perhaps you don't use a pattern... that would open up the images more and let them breathe.You could even space the other lines out so that there is space for "the most obvious lie" implying it is there when it is not.You'd need to add some transitional words to smooth it out.Anyway, just a thought! Great work! Forgive me, this is rather disappointing. For someone who seems to interested in the knowledge and understanding, to dismiss a view before you investigate it is rather hypocritical.Good luck though with your further studies. So, I am not going to pretend I am more knowledgeable than you. But I have read thorough trinitarian arguments and thorough non-trinitarian arguments, and the non-trinitarian arguments always make more sense. So what I am going to do is refer you to our best arguers rather than argue with you myself. However, I will tell you that the verses you provided about the divinity of Jesus are all thoroughly explained by the sources I will provide, and they will do a far better job than I can. (EDIT: I am referring specifically to the commentaries in the bible version I linked to, although the church does sometimes have articles or videos about some of the common verses) I hope you take a look at them.Here is a rather simple cursory breakdown of why we non-trinitarians believe as we do: [47 Reasons Why Our Heavenly Father Has No Equals or Co-Equals](https://www.truthortradition.com/articles/47-reasons-why-our-heavenly-father-has-no-equals-or-co-equals)Spirit And Truth Fellowship International as a very very prolific and strong research team. Feel free to contact them with more historical questions. I will also link you to their translation of the Bible that they have been working on and research for years. The commentary is extensive and all the proof texts that are used to prove the trinity have extensive entries that thoroughly explain why why do not agree with the trinitarian position. I have no read a single one that didn't make sense. [The Revised English Version is available here.](https://www.stfonline.org/rev)... if a verse is marked red, there is commentary for it. They meticulously explain why they translate things as they have, especially if it deviates from the common understandings of today.Lastly, [here is their contact page.](https://www.stfonline.org/contact)... if you have specific questions about translations you see, or about explanations in the commentary that don't make sense, John is usually the one who responds to questions and he happens to lead the research. Hey, thanks for the kind words. It was nice chatting as well! I don't acquiesce to trolls :) Take care. You are ruining the discourse all over the internet. Be a decent person. Oh... you are a dishonest person. You make a fair point, the verses I am referring to tend to speak more to adding or subtracting from the spirit of the word rather than literally adding text. If a text is spiritually and logically consistent, perhaps it is possible to add to it. However when it comes to religions like LDS, the texts they added fail to meet what I would say is spiritually or logically consistent. There is. It is just not as easy to uncover as we would like, but it is there in the scriptures.And of course there is a right answer, it's just we haven't adequately convinced each other of what it is. > and I can definitely point to areas in the bible where the concept of hell exists.I would challenge you on that.>that it is the main criticism that people have towards religious peopleI don't mean this to sound as biting as it might, but really? The main criticism I hear towards religious people is that we are idiots and cowards who have to believe in something because we are weak. It's sort of impregnated with this idea that we are not willing or able to source our claims and that this is a weakness even of the smartest and most studied of us. The critics often tend to the be ones that don't source their claims as related to religious discussion, they typically just spout new-atheist rhetoric... like that God is evil if he exists or other stuff from someone like Dawkins who builds his arguments against Christianity not on what it is, but more how people erroneously carry it out. They constantly cherry pick details of the Bible and say "See! God is evil, you horrible person." ignoring the narrative overall and the context of what they are "citing"... but because technically they pulled a quote from the Bible, they have sourced their claim. It's garbage. Anyway, what I'm speaking to is a problem with discourse generally, not just in religious conversations. Some of the most upvoted posts I've seen lately on r/bestof are posts where some user "documents" all "lies Trump has told" or all the "republican abuse" over the years. And they have this comprehensively sources list of, say, republicans who were convicted of some kind of sex crime. The thing is, the lists are poorly crafted, one I saw included Dennis Radar, the BTK killer. If I made a list of Democrat abuse, should I include serial killers? John Wayne Gacy was a democrat. And that leads to another issue... why the hell would you make that list to begin with? The whole point of it is to demonize Republicans, not to "document abuse". The whole endeavor was dishonest and people ate it up because it was "well sourced", except the truth is that the argument presented was that Republicans are evil. And that argument was incredibly poorly sourced despite having so many sources. Why? Because if Republicans are evil, you have to argue that they are evil by comparison to other groups. The implication of the "argument" is that you should vote democrat because republicans are evil, but a good argument would honestly match the democrats against the republicans and see which one is evil. But they don't do that because reasonable people know that democrats are far from innocent too. It is dishonest rhetoric and it happens all the time. In almost any conversation where people disagree on reddit, it becomes a battle of who can find the most minor issues wrong with what their opponent said instead of listening to the whole of the argument. It's to the point where you can't talk observationally about trends you have seen without incurring the wrath of someone who will tell you that you have cognitive bias and that you are probably wrong simply because of that.People are almost constantly running red lights where I live and that has changed over the past 15-20 years. Instead of assuming I was correct, a user I spoke with "knew" I was wrong and said I had no sources. This kind of behavior is like walking around not believing anything around you is real unless there is a source for it. It is insane. But the primary reason people do it is because they want to shut down ideas they don't agree with before they even hear them. They act as if they are doing reason a service, but they are simply shutting down the discourse. No one should stand for it, it's eliminating our ability to just talk and listen to each other.>To me, I don‚Äôt view it well when one side is held to a standard that another isn‚Äôt held to.What side is not held to that standard? In this case in particular and in general? Frankly, what I've seen is a dishonest application of the standard. People source dishonestly, but they will take a dishonestly sources comment over an honest unsourced post. It is enraging. I will see valid logical arguments using nothing but reason and common knowledge and I'll get a "source?"... are you kidding? They are asking for a source for something there would be no study on... How do these people live? I imagine them sitting at a table presented with food, but they can't eat it because no one has written a comment with citations that say it is safe to eat, and they hesitate to pick of their fork and knife because they read an article that has crap sources that say forks are a form of the racist patriarchy.We need to be better listeners and actually listen to reason. People will ignore solid logical arguments because there is no source... even when the logical is irrefutable. Forgive the long answer but even this is complicated haha.I hope this doesn't sound like a cop out but I'm non-denominational. I'd rather just say I'm a Christian and put aside our doctrinal differences.The idea that I'm talking about though has a few names at least as it relates to the trinity. I tend to say I'm just "non-trinitarian Christian", but there is a group that calls themselves "Biblical Unitarians" which is intended to mean they believe the Bible and that there is one God and one Lord and they are separate. I don't like this name because it is confused with Unitarian Universalists who believe any path is a path to God so you get churches with Christians, Muslims, atheists, Buddhists, and so on. This group believes Jesus is the only path... or I should say the only path for gentiles as Jews still have their covenant with God.Finally I heard a term recently from a similar group that I kind of liked. They called themselves "Monotheist" Christian's. I like it because it's kind of an implicit dig trinitarians, basically  calling them polytheists. While Catholics do seem to have a strangely polytheistic view, I don't really look at the trinity as true polytheism... but I still kinda like the term "Monotheist" for this non-trinitarian perspective.So the trinity is the primary sticking point for these groups. Among us non-trinitarians there are some different views though. It seems most of us do not believe in hell, but some do. Some groups among us believe in the pre-existence of Christ, meaning that he was actually alive in the beginning... but frankly that doesn't make sense if he's just a man (my group believe the idea of Christ was well established and that the idea of Christ was what all of creation was built through, hence the idea of all things through Christ). I mean I bet you could find calvinist non-trinitarians.I think JW's are technically non-trinitarian, but they have some odd additional beliefs that we would argue against.Anyway, if you are curious here is a [link to a very basic sort of layout of the reasoning of non-trinitarians](https://www.truthortradition.com/articles/47-reasons-why-our-heavenly-father-has-no-equals-or-co-equals) from the group I am most associated with. No worries. Just curious! >Protestant theologians and Biblical scholars claim exactly the same thing.Of course they claim the exact same thing, but they don't do the exact same thing... how can you if you refuse to test something like the Trinity even thought it was agreed upon around 400AD? Given that, if you assume the trinity, then you are biasing the wrong way. You should bias yourself against something that we know was established after the fact. The trinity should be assumed false, and yet it is usually assumed true. It should be assumed false because it is never mentioned in the Bible directly or with a different but synonymous term (edit for clarity). The proofs are implications at best. We have so much explicitly stated doctrine, why are we taking implicit doctrine as fact when that should be the one we question?>Could they really be that much further from the truth than someone who does it as a hobby ?That's some pharisee kind of thinking there, haha.But to answer your question, yes, they could. But it is the argument, not the person, that matters. Jesus was a minority thinker and was not the established view. He was right, the established pharisees were wrong. Even if you don't believe Christianity, this narrative has been seen so many times in so many arenas of life that you have to consider it when it comes up.You are a smart guy, I hope you see that your point here is poisoning the well against me rather than arguing against my point over all point. Either the argument against Hell or against the Trinity stand or they don't. Whether I'm a hobbyist or a renowned theologian is immaterial, whether other theologians say similar things or not is also immaterial. Hitler probably said something similar, too. I'm sure the Catholic church has claimed they want to get to a purer form of the faith as well. This shouldn't matter, the argument is what matters. Not sure why you were downvoted... but I think you kind of miss something here.Christian humanism is interesting, but it is also kind of different I think that what you are describing with Buddhists who don't worship Buddha. It kind of sounds like you are trying to describe Christian Atheists who basically think Christianity is the best way to live, but they just don't believe Christ or God are real.Christian Humanism, and I am a bit of layman so forgive me if I'm mistaken, seems to be just be a precursor to Lutheranism... their respect for reason and inquiry being the driving force behind someone like Luther and his actions. And they seemed to come right before Luther was around. >Long story short, yes you can be a Christian and not believe in the divinity of Jesus.I'm thankful there are people as you who say this.>Arianism is one of the big early movements that Jesus was not GodThis is kind of an interesting comment to me. I would argue that the biggest early movement that Jesus was not God was Jesus' own movement. When it is put your way, it seems the subversion of the deity of Christ postdates the idea of the deity of Christ. When I would argue that the truth is the subversion of the manhood of Christ postdated his actual manhood. Yes, but the trinity is such a touchy subject for many or most Christians. Any question about the trinity is a sacrilegious question that denies the deity of Christ. I mean, I am literally denying the deity of Christ, but they impregnate that truth with this spiritual alarmism that somehow we are destroying Christ by saying he was a man. Frankly, it seems more freeing that way. LDS is a tricky one. It is so far removed from Christianity and has extra-Biblical texts (edit) which are expressly forbidden in other parts of scripture.I have a lot of respect for adherents to LDS and I think many of them are legitimately saved, but I think that is largely despite their organization and traditional doctrine. I see Catholicism and JW's in the same way... usually great people and many are probably legitimately saved, but it is often despite their understanding rather than because of it.It's really unfortunate what happened to Christianity as Rome took it over... but ironically, their bastardization of it helped it survive so that the more pure version of it could one day come out. And I think a lot of that more pure version, the one that Jesus' apostles knew before Rome hijacked it, is now being understood by more and more people. For the record, I didn't downvote you... but I do wonder why you didn't just ask one or two of them rather than saying you have them? Yeah. Somehow they wedge this fear and all the human emotion that would be there, despite there really being none of the risk. You don't need to inject that into the story if Jesus is actually just a man. I didn't say that was how the burden of proof works.It was the pharisees who demanded proof. And they were the fools. That is not to say that proof isn't important, but to put it above simply listening and understanding someone? That *is* foolish. Conversation is not about the burden of proof, it is about listening.The user's argument is strong, ask for some materials that corroborate it. Don't just disregard it and say "the burden of proof is on her". You do not hear people when you are demanding they prove themselves, that is why the pharisees denied Jesus. And the thing was, Jesus had the proof, he had all the reasoning he needed, but they didn't listen.Did Jesus demand proof of anything before he listened? No, he typically listened to people before anything else.Talk with a person, see if their points logically flow, and then ask for the proof. >Jesus being made lower than the angels.How is he lower than the angels if he still commands the angels? If a man is given command of the angels, is he not still higher than them?>The blood of a man would never be good enough for our sinsWhy?Is Jesus not the second Adam? Was Adam also God? If Adam was also God, how could Adam have sinned?>When He died, he went to hell, but rose again. The blood of a man could not do thatWhy? The common reasoning is circular, "If Jesus wasn't God then he couldn't do X, but he did X so he must be God". The reason Jesus could do that was because of God. Why does Jesus talk about his father if he is God? If Jesus IS God, the simple thing to say is  "I am Yahweh!" He never does that. There are times when he say "I and the father are one" (I am paraphrasing, but that is the exact conceptual idea, that they are one). But that can easily be explained with a very common figurative language structure."You and me... we da same, yo!" We are obviously not the same. What I am saying if I say something like that is simply that we share some very important traits. When Jesus says he and the Father are one, all he means is that they are of the same accord, they are both righteous and pushing for the same thing, and they are working for it together. They are one force, they are a team. It's like the whole "I am Negan" thing from The Walking Dead. Only Negan is Negan... his followers are just showing their solidarity. It's figurative language.Let's contextualize that Philippians verse a little more (I went with the KJV:>5 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: 6 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: 7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:5 is merely stating "Think this way also, which is the way Jesus thinks". 6 says "Jesus, who was of the same form/nature/spirit/cut-from-the-same-cloth as God (but was not actually God). 7 says "He took the role of servant and rather took on the servitude of man."All this passage is saying is not that God magically came down and became a human being. It's saying Jesus could have exalted himself. He could have said "Guys, I am the son of God!!! Do what I say!" Instead he did what a regular person should do, one who isn't the king of the entire world... and he served his brothers and sisters.This passage is about Jesus defying the worldly expectation that a King rules with authority and power. A righteous king rules in servitude to his people.Just a point of logic here. In verses 7-9 it talks about Jesus lowering himself to this level of servitude, and then God exalting him above every name, basically because Jesus really freaking got it. He understood righteousness, he understood what it takes to have a righteous creation. Anyway, the point of logic here is if God exalted him, while Jesus made himself low... what the heck is the point? Jesus and God must be separate beings for this to make sense.Now a trinitarian says "well yeah, but they ARE separate." And then you ask them why they think Jesus is God and they say "Because they aren't separate!"... it's maddening frankly. It was an invention by the Catholics. It is a logical loophole, you can't defeat it. That doesn't make it right, it makes it circular reasoning. The trinity is just a big piece of Circular reasoning that is sealed with this belief that it is also righteous.Nothing about the trinity is a requisite for salvation. Not only that, but it makes what Jesus did even more miraculous if he wasn't also God. So why believe in the trinity? You will come at me with John 1:1, and whole bunch of other texts, and there are a lot of really simple explanations for them, but you have so many of them that it floods that argument.What is that logical fallacy where you flood your opponent with questions? The trinity is a natural one of those, too.God doesn't work like that, He is pretty cut and dry. So is Jesus. And the parables he uses aren't really vague either.Please forgive me if I sound a touch frustrated, I don't mean to aim that at you directly. It's just the Trinity is probably the last and most difficult nut to crack when it comes to vestigial Catholic doctrine that ought to be left behind, but it is holding on so hard.I have some rather detailed resources if you would like to see. Isn't that what Christians were before Catholicism?I believe Jesus paid for my sins and I accept him as my king. And I believe he is the perfect king because he perfectly follows the one true God. This is one of the modern day fallacies that people don't realize.Yes, citations are important. But they are not everything. In other words, when you are leading someone through an argument, you don't necessarily cite studies or verses. You make your point. If the logic makes sense, then maybe it's time to back it up with some citations.One of the problems with reddit is that people are quick to disregard valid arguments because they aren't cited well, and they are quick to accept shit argument just because someone linked a whole bunch of articles that often don't even support the claim.This is not how people actually converse. If I make a point and the logic seems reasonable, then say "hey, I think that makes a lot of sense, but do you have some sources?"We should trust but verify. Instead people deny unless there is verification, and then they shit on the verification.Have the conversation first, then get to the proofs, you know? >But wouldn't the natural place to land if you want to "de-romanize" Christianity be some form of Protestantism?No. If you made chocolate milk and you want to get back to regular milk, what do you do? Do you try to take out the chocolate or do you just pour a new glass of milk?Trying to pull out little pieces of problem with Catholicism doesn't is not even close to as clean an endeavor as reading the scripture as it actually is and not assuming anything from Catholicism was correct. Protestantism assumes much of it was correct and just argues a few things.Now, I don't think Catholicism got absolutely everything wrong, but frankly, it messed up enough that I think it's worth it to not even mess with Protestantism or something. I'd rather try to get the purity of the original message And it's not that difficult these days with all the new access to old Greek and Aramaic texts we have found. The most difficult part is trying to let go of some traditional beliefs we've had.And the thing is, there is a ton that survived the mess. Salvation is still salvation. Even with some new discoveries, that doctrine remains. I just did a cursory glance of Marcionism. I don't reject the Hebrew God... I believe in the God of Abraham, just the Jesus is separate from that God. Jesus is a man, a very special man. Just not a God.I find it kind of ridiculous to think it is miraculous for God to become a human and have to trust that He will bring himself back to life after the Crucifixion. It is much more miraculous to believe a man, just like you or me faced that choice. >Do you think these are just parables? Or a mistranslation maybe?The TL;DR would be, both and more. It is incredibly complicated because the language has been twisted so much, sometimes on purpose, sometimes by mistake, sometimes due to translation errors, sometimes due to conceptual errors that informed the translation choices. This is why the arguments go on forever because there is so much to unpack.Another issue is that there is a ton of figurative language in the Bible. This is why I get so annoyed when people pose that gotcha question "Well you either read the Bible literally or you don't!" That's not true, you read some parts literally and other parts figuratively. There is even figurative language in newspapers and text books. When you read about right-leaning and left-politicians, do you picture certain people who literally lean right or left? No, it is figurative. If you read the news or the Bible literally neither would make sense.Figurative language is everywhere but we don't even realize it. A lot of that language we use today, but for some reason we don't think they spoke that way in the Bible. Ever have your mom ask you to take out the trash and you say "Done!" Do you mean it is literally done? No, you mean it is a sure thing. That's how confident you are that you will take out the trash. That is known as the Prophetic Perfect tense, it is an entire tense that is not literal and it is used all the time in the Bible.Another example: Think about a coach saying "Alright, Masterson is the plan! Even before we started writing up our plays, we knew that Masterson was the plan. Get the ball to Masterson!" Masterson is not a plan. When Jesus is called the Word (Logos... which also basically means "plan"), this same kind of language is used. These are just a couple of examples, but those two examples alone show how the confusion happens. How can a Christian say they are already victorious when Jesus hasn't even returned yet? How can we say we have eternal life when we are all going to die if Jesus doesn't return soon? People forget about the Prophetic Perfect tense and then make up some explanation to scripture. They might say "well God says I am healed through Jesus! Why am I not actually healed?" and then they get discouraged and sad. They don't know what the text is actually saying.There is so much of this kind of language in all of our speech, but in the Bible these kinds of things are what are most prone to problems with interpretation over the centuries.>How do you square the verses in the Bible where Jesus clearly stated there will be some sort of separationFirst, death is separation. What is farther separated, you and a person on the exact opposite point on the globe? Or you and anyone who is dead?This is actually super simple, it's just not really common knowledge anymore, not in religious circle. It's kind of the basic atheist point of view. Atheists believe that when you die you are just dead; you cease to be. Most Christians believe in an eternal soul thing, I do not, but this is besides the point. The atheist view is that once you are dead you are forever disconnected from the living world and from existence. This is almost the same idea that Christians had before Catholicism. Jews also mostly believed this: when you die, you cease to exist, there is no soul that floats out of your body. To cease to exist is to be eternally separated from existence, as if you were just deleted off the hard drive of the universe. "Eternally" just means forever.So if you extend this to the Judeo-Christian world view, just like the Atheist world view, when you die, you die. You are separated from God. If you cease to exist, you are separated from God eternally... forever. We often add this spiritual connotation to the word "eternal", it just means forever in this case. So the separation is pretty simple, just not what we are used to today.There is a further separation, though. Remember how I mentioned dying is like being deleted from the hard drive? I won't go into the details of the "second death" but to put it in metaphorical terms. If the first death is like being deleted from the hard drive, the second death is like being deleted from all the iTunes servers and stuff. You can't be redownloaded... not even by God.That is "eternal punishment", it goes on eternally. The punishment isn't the torture of fire and hell, it is merely not being able to be with God. Many fellow Christians argue God is loving, yet this idea of Hell is just about the most painful horrible torment anyone could think of. What kind of God would do that to even His enemies? Critics of Christianity rightly jump on this idea, because that would be cruel. God doesn't do that.It certainly isn't loving to torture people forever. But love IS the force that makes us choose to cut things out of our lives that hurt us and those we love. Have you ever had a toxic person in your life? Everyone hurts us in life from time to time, but toxic people just need to be cut out. We don't do this out of hate or animus, we do it because we care about ourselves and those this person might hurt. And so regrettably we cut those toxic people out of our lives. This is really what final judgment is: if you really don't want to be here or can't follow God's rules, then you just have go. He's not going to torment you in Hell forever, you just cease to be... just like what would have happened if atheists were right anyway. And then poof: you are gone forever... nor torment, no pain, but no joy, no love, no one else... nothing. You are tossed into the Lake of Fire where all that you once were is consumed. The Lake of Fire is basically like when you delete everything in your recycle bin on your computer and then de-frag your computer so you can't recover the files at all.>into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels...And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life"So I touched on this above, but will expound here. Again, the punishment is ceasing to exist, not living forever in torment.One of the points of confusion with hell is the concept of Gehenna. That was literally an ancient garbage dump which was constantly on fire (one might say *eternally* on fire). So when Jesus talks about being thrown into Gehenna he is making a comparison to the world as the people at the time would have known to make his point. He spoke in terms people of the time an place would understand, just like me with this hard drive talk. All Jesus is saying is that you will be tossed out like garbage and consumed by the flames. The flames are eternal, the garbage is not (I always think of the tire fire in the Simpsons). Sometimes when talk about death we say things like "the worms will eat you"... except you are dead, you don't exist, what was once your body is eaten by the worms, you are already dead. This is in the Bible too, worms are connected to that Gehenna place, adding to the confusion and leading to people thinking that Hell is a place where bad people are tormented by worms and flames.When the Bible talks about fire and salvation, usually it is reference to the fire consuming something, not tormenting something... and usually it consumes garbage or what is evil, leaving what is good.So Satan and all evil is simply consumed by fire and then ceases to be, leaving only those who asked God to make them righteous.But if it weren't confusing enough, there is another complication. There is a part of the story where Satan *is* locked up.Just to very quickly say, Jesus returns and a whole bunch of stuff happens. He sets up his 1000 year kingdom, which is awesome. Christians are all brought back, but there will be some regular people who made it through. During this time Satan and his minions are locked away somewhere. After that 1000 years, they are set loose. Things go bad quick, there is a final war. Jesus wins, and then there is the final judgment where Satan and his minions and all those people throughout all of history who decide they do not want the gift of eternal life, will be thrown into the lake of fire, consumed, and then cease to exist.Anyway, Satan IS locked up for a time. And so the idea that there is a place where bad beings are locked away is true... but that is for something specific. It is not for the eternal torment.Death is the eternal punishment, that's it. No torture or anything... just nothingness. She is correct. I would have to work on some sources because frankly they require a lot of deep study into the Greek and Aramaic. I am a Christian but one who is seen a gravely mistaken if not heretical because I do not believe in Hell, nor do I believe in the Trinity which was also agreed upon by the Catholic church at about 400 AD. I believe Jesus was just a man, thought sinless. Jesus is not God in this view.The user does not explain the intent well. It was not just for power, however that was certainly a concern. They also wanted to unify the many ideas that were around almost immediately after Christ's death.Consider the views that existed at the time. All of them had these figure head kinds of gods that were powerful and had a face. Jesus had to compete with that, and while you wouldn't want religion to be a competition (if something is true, it is true, if it is false it is false), it became a competition. But Jesus isnt a God, he is a man. How can a man compete with a god in a polytheistic world?But if you make him one with not only a god but the supreme God, suddenly he's got more appeal in the polytheistic world. Then you throw in the saints and basically deify them into minor gods and suddenly you have a monotheistic religion dressed up like a polytheistic one.This would make it easier to keep the empire unified, which is certainly about power, but it is more than about just power. It becomes about security and culture.The idea of hell is also not just there for power. Consider, the talk about hell and brimstone and fire is quite intriguing. If you want people in the seats at church, that is often what got them. It was kind of an advertising gimmick that came out of some confusion with scripture.There are times when Jesus refers to Hades. He was in Rome, talking to people familiar with Roman belief. So he said something like "not even the gates of hades will open up to destroy this church". He was just saying that nothing will stop the church and referring to something people would know at the time. It would be like me saying "not even Santa himself could deliver this gift better!" I'm not saying I believe in Santa, I'm making an exaggerated point about how firmly I believe I will deliver the gift.But people are not smart, and they take figurative language literally sometimes. And that is part of why the idea of hell exists in modern Christian belief.Basically, Rome hijacked Christianity, turned it into something Christian-like but palatable to the polytheists who believe in many gods and in an underworld, and suddenly the shift to a national religion is a lot easier because you have appeased real Christians and you have appeased polytheists.This was in part for power but that is too simplistic. It was to unify and support. It wasn't invented to keep people scared. There is already a legitimate fear in Christianity and that is to be eternally separated from God.So basically you have to options. Either you say "no thanks" to God and when you die you just stay dead. Or you accept God and live forever.Anyway, I'm not trying to preach here, but this was not as simple as the user made it out. Who gives a shit? This always results in a reduction of the max penalty. They framed the story in such a trashy way, acting like it was a fool's errand and showing video of guys scaling the wall. They also framed it around these farmer types on the water worrying the government is going to take their land. I mean that would* suck, but security is critical.So they framed it in a trashy way, but im glad to see it progressing. >Apparently no other factors are relevant to average life expectancy. Not road deaths, or murder rates, or obesity rates, or hurricanes, or tornadoes, or frontline military service...This is something I honestly hadn't considered. I mean I know that life expectancy is complicated and that it is obviously highly related to health, but considering all those factors is not something the average person thinks of. And some of that is kind of telling. The US is the 3rd biggest military (obviously the most powerful), but then you go down the list and the first European nation you see on the list is France down at like 23. The US offers so much protection to Europe and so we incur the most deaths which would affect our life expectancy... perhaps not a ton, but I imagine I could be responsible for a 10th of a year or so.Anyway, thank you for bringing that to my attention! Life expectancy is just another vague statistic that appears to apply to certain concepts like health care in such a cut and dry way, but it is not. Thanks for sharing this. The vagueness of the understanding we have of your system is why it is looked at so lovingly here.Just doing some cursory research about the system I saw how little doctors are paid there, making it seem like it would be hard to get anyone interested in going into it. The primary care physicians make what a 10th year teacher makes here it seems.EDIT: sent before I finished my thought. Busy day today. That Scandinavian countries are capitalist (this part is mostly correct) with large welfare programs... that is the incorrect part. Sweden limits private firms. It does so through legislation that limits the market. From Wikipedia:>Private healthcare is rarity in Sweden, and even those private institutions work under the mandated city councils. The city councils regulates the rules and the establishment of potential private practices.While the way it is described sounds kind of nice with councils seeming to ensure that private companies are in it for the right reasons or something, this is not at all a free market endeavor. This is the government owning the means of production and essentially leasing our the rights to enter the market. That is socialism.So in your previous post, being that it seems like no one actually votes on these "councils" (though I didn't find that information, so perhaps they do), this would not be a "democratic socialism", this would be a pocket of straight socialism within democratic system. I am assuming a bit here with the voting, but it seems these councils run outside the political aspects of the country kind of like how our FCC is non-partisan.Democratic Socialism is this idea that the people get to vote on these things, but the things the government takes over typically are not things that the whims of the voter ought to touch. We do not want voters to decide how to control what the FCC controls, we would not want the voters to control health care. And so in a "democratic socialist" system, they would not once those commissions/committees/councils are established. People would not vote on them, or if they did, it would be in very very specific aspects while the control lies almost or entirely within the purview of those councils.So my argument is that democratic socialsim is a bit of a misnomer and that the Scandinavian point you made is inaccurate. It's interesting people think that when Trump has actually freed people up after Bush and Obama actually incrementally took some freedom away. I think you are technically correct but philosophically incorrect. The reasoning you use is kind of the reasoning that people use when they want to avoid the fact that Nazi's were socialists.At some point (and I suppose I cannot say exactly when) the amount of regulation and government involvement pushed into a system founded on capitalism, the freedom of the market is so reduced that it is no longer even kind of free. Technically there were private owners of companies in Nazi Germany, but the government told you what to make and even intervened in how you ran and operated it, especially if you hired Jews. That is not capitalism. That is not a hands off government, that is a very very controlling government who will use force to get what it wants... so the companies play along.If the government exerts that much control over your company, who really owns it?Think about this, it's kind of a mind fuck. Most things you buy, you pay for once and they are yours. But not your property. Property you must pay a tax on and keeping your property is contingent upon you paying those taxes. What happens if you don't pay? You get evicted. You don't actually own your property when there are property taxes, you are renting from the government. This is why property taxes are evil.Anyway, the point is that technically the deed might be under someone's name but that deed is only as good as the government that enforces it.A company might be owned by a person, but that ownership is only as strong as the government that enforces it. This is why socialism is not just a danger when a socialist takes office, it creeps in. Things like property taxes happen and are crammed down our throats... we never should have stood for that. Frankly, I think it should go to the supreme court, I think it violates our constitutional rights. We should tax sales more, that way the market dictates how much the government can spend. If it does well, the government can spend or save the surplus, it if fails, it will have to tighten its belt. I love you. Umm, what? Do you know where the kept him? Because the specific place where they kept him is known for being understaffed, over capacity by about 50%. There are rats and insects that are audible at night. It is cold in some places and hot in others, it is rank and dank and it is known as some of the hardest time you will do if you must go there.This is a jail that is meant to be temporary, it houses a large number of terror suspects. El Chapo himself was put there and this, of all places, is where he started hallucinating and acting very strange.I tend to think he didn't kill himself, but at the same time, the details surrounding the the death also pretty reasonably point to suicide as valid narrative. Thank you!I've been considering that stanza a lot. You hit on something I want to achieve with it but also a weakness I felt in it. It's sort of meant to have an unenthusiastic or apathetic tone, like "yeah, we get it". But I sort of sacrificed the sound for it.I will play around with it, I'm not sure how to transition it because that feeling is intentional. So maybe I need to let it breath with a couple more lines. Or perhaps "this breeds that" could be replaced with something less vague but also really cliche... I don't know but thanks again! I appreciate it! First of all, thank your for this beautiful compliment. I have never been complimented so thoroughly and you hit on some things that I was really happy to hear. And thank you for your analysis! There is a sort of narrative of reason (I guess we would call it) hidden in there that is relatively simple, or can be put very simply. I really love the way reason flows and arguments flow and falter, so I often write alluding to math and physics, especially as they relate to the unknown, faith, and love. I would explain the narrative, but I don't really want to based on how much I enjoyed reading your analysis and how you pulled your thoughts into it. It was a pleasure to read.I agree with you about that second stanza and am toying with the idea of making it parenthetical. The first line ties more to the rather laborious image in the last two line, while the second and third are sort of a parenthetical explanation of the first. So I thought putting them in parentheses might help.But even then, the sticking point is still "triangulate", as you pointed out. That word feels like it's all stresses haha and is not very graceful.Thanks again for all the feedback! Could you maybe not do this? No, the state is not in charge of educating the children. The state gives you the option to send your child to public school, private school, or home school. You can select the kinds of values you want to instill in your children. In communism, the state decides your morals, and if you the parent disagree, well tough shit, you can't do anything about it. They aren't going to invite you in and hear your concerns, they are following the state curricula and there is no opting out.Don't lie. You are over simplifying the system here so that it sounds like itxs already communism. It's not even close and your comparison is absurd. That's how they shovel it down your throat and make it taste good. It makes it sound like you all have stock in everything. But the truth is that strata in society forms and never lets go of their power. And when you eliminate money from society, the only currency is power. So you have effectively eliminated the means of anyone in society to amass any sort of power to counter those already in power because power can't be amassed by the average person when they can't collect their own money. By the way this:>Healthcare in the us is now such a huge political issue, people are tricked into going against their own best interest.Could easily be said to others. Our best interest is a government that doesn't have as much power as it does. Our best interest is ensuring freedom, not that everyone gets free shit. Hmm that's not what I said. I really like the imagery here. The first half reads almost saccharine and then we get a turn in the last three lines where this is not just love, it's lust.The 4th and 5th lines seem almost too graphic... they work as they turn the more saccharine beginning into the most lustful end. But I played with the poem and read it cutting those two lines out and separating it into two stanzas, the second stanza starting with "Your body feels like contraband in my hands" It was interesting to see the difference. I don't know which way I like better.Anyway, great job! I love how smoothly it reads while the images are so jarring. It brings this disturbing fluidity to these ideas of suicide and pain. I also really like how your title is so percussive and staccato and then I naturally read all the lines much more legato until you get to "if battles win war". There is still a smoothness but it hesitates.It also ends very well was you finish the rhyme scheme off. Did you play with ending in a less smooth way, perhaps deviating from the rhyme scheme for just that line? I imagine it would make the poem end much less hopeful than it seems to. Perhaps an interesting experiment to pursue.Good work! The problem is not so much the word, it is how you assumed intent and also exaggerating a little bit.Yeah, in some rare instances not cleaning off your car might actually end in the deaths of others. But that is due to a confluence of factors. It's not like it is common for a shard of ice to bust through a windshield and decapitate someone. It's even unlikely for all that snow to plop off, causing the cars behind to slide. The roads are probably already bad... the snow on the cars doesn't help, but it's the conditions in general that lead to the crashes more than anything.Anyway, every one SHOULD clear of their cars adequately, it's just part of being responsible. But being a little irresponsible is not the same as being a completely irredeemable asshole who doesn't care about anyone but themselves.This is bad rhetoric. People are people, they are usually just doing the best they can. Making them out to be monsters doesn't help. Making them out to be people who don't care about life is untrue.I could say you don't care about life because you are using electricity that is powered by coal and buying electronics that are bad for the environment. But you have to do it, right? You have to do all that so you aren't an asshole, but these people who don't have to go to their jobs and juggle their work life with their responsibilities to their kids... they don't have to do that right? So if they do it but they don't do it in not the most perfect way, then they are complete assholes.How many red lights have you run? That kills a lot of people. How many times have you sped or merged improperly? How many times have you just checked you phone while driving? How many times have you crossed the street without getting the little white walking guy light or crossed where there was no cross walk? Every single one of those times you could have killed someone. Hell, littering can kill dogs and babies some times. Have you ever littered?Are you an irredeemable egoist who is completely and utterly self involved and who doesn't care about anyone or their lives? No, you are a normal human being who makes mistakes. In music there is what is known as a triplet.If you have 4/4 time signature, that means there are 4 quarter notes to every measure or 4 beats.One.    Two.    Three.    Four.   It is common to break those 4 beats up with something between then. Itxs the same tempo, but it feels a bit faster with the 'ands' in here. What we get are essentially iambs, a tetrameter of them.and One. and Two. and Three. and Four.A triplet is when you fit 3 beats into this even rhythm.and One bah bah Two. and Three. and Four.The one, two, three, and four, are still spaced the same, we just crammed those 2 bahs in there along with the One. So you get three hits where there would have been two.You hear this in songs all the time, cramming more syllables into a beat, sometimes defying the even rhythm.So I'll write a crappy line of iambic pentameter to show how this works.He **went** to **see** the **love** she **had** in**side**.This is strict iambic pentameter.He **went** to **see** the **love** that she **had** in**side**.You still read it with the stresses all falling into the same beats, but "that she had" fits three syllables into the space of two. So you naturally read those syllables a bit faster to fit in the same rhythm. This is a triplet in music terms. In poetry I think you would just say that we fit an anapest in the space of an iamb.Use the meter you select help guide you... but it shouldn't stop you from playing with the rhythm. It is simple. When people are given free things, they do not work.We have so many examples of this in our own country. Bill Clinton changed welfare laws so that people couldn't get it so easily, and when he did, thousands and thousands of men who were on welfare just up and got jobs.In China during the shift into communism, farm production and steel utterly failed. Why? There was no incentive to work, the only incentive that existed was to make it look like they had worked. This led to massive steel shortages and famine.When people offer you free stuff, they may mean well, they may even try to make it sound justifiable. But they are not looking at the basic facts... if you don't have to work for the money you get, you won't. I would invest it in gold because giving everyone 1000 a month would tank the economy so at least I would have some valuable gold when the economy is ruined. We get a lot of butthurt banned people who lurk and downvote because they think it achieves something. It does not. An egoist is the exact opposite of an altruist. These are extreme characteristics (edit for typo). The vast majority of people are not altruists or egoists, they are somewhere in between.English is important. And demonizing people for this is silly. Egoist - a self-centered or selfish person (opposed to altruist). an arrogantly conceited personIt is an extreme word for someone who just didn't clear their roof. You know, I've met people who have on occasion failed to clean off their roof. They weren't conceited assholes, they made a bad choice.Don't demonize people. Yeah, but again, egoists? That's a far cry from people who are just inconsiderate. In that thumbnail, yes. This is getting good. Hold him accountable how? I hear people make dumb quips all the time. I just move on. People put on a lot of airs and act like presidents are different and should be held to a higher standard, except most of our presidents have said plenty of stupid or off color things.I think it's healthy to some degree. Look at how the British parliament trades barbs all the time.So I'm all for holding presidents accountable, but for tweets? If there is something real, then fine. But the way he talks? How superficial is that? An inconsiderate egoist? I mean I think they are usually just unaware... inconsiderate is perhaps valid. But an egoist? Can we maybe not assume the worst of people?Half the people in this thread complaining probably text while they're driving at least once in a while and yet act like this on here. Are you an egoist now because you don't watch absolutely everyone around you at wegmans? Are you an egoist for taking 11 items into the 10 items or less line?Can we stop with the extreme rhetoric please? > Your moral stance on not wanting the government to have too much power seems to me as a uniquely American phenomenonDo you know why this is? Because governments can turn on dime, and when they have that much power, then the people have no means of fighting back. Sounds like doomsday crap, and yet this is the trajectory of every government since the dawn of time. Nazi Germany was great for the people in it for a while. Rome was awesome for so many people until it had to deal with big problems. Dictators aren't all bad until they have to make the hard decisions.>why wouldn‚Äôt you want to help the less fortunate?This is a lie, and frankly, it's insulting. I have given time and money. I have helped a poor women at risk of losing her trailer paint it so she woulnd't be evicted. I have helped watch kids or drive people so they could start job or just interview for a job. I have given money to friends in need and to strangers in need and to charities who I trust to do great things. Not only do we want to, but conservatives give more to charity in terms of both money and time in the US than liberals. So we want to and we do.We simply believe that it is better and more efficient to allow private industry, private citizens, and charities do this rather than have government do all the leg work. Again, more control to the government means more power to the government.And consider this: charities tend to be far more efficient than government. There are charities where 95% of money donated goes directly to helping the people they intended to help (that's a really good number, I would say 80-85% is average to decent). With welfare, only about 50% makes it. Why? The bureaucracy and the clunkiness of government. For all the talk about the government being able to bargain for better prices on medicine, this phenomenon ruins all of that. Think about all the parts needed to run that, from the tax collection system, to the auditors, to the law makers, that is only the first leg of the journey and that is only the federal level.If you had $1000 to donate, would you give it to the charity that returns 95% to the people in need, or 50%? When the government is the charity, you have no choice.Not only that, but you get to choose what specifically to help with when you are giving to charity and you can respond as the need arises and as you believe it will be more beneficial. With government controlling it, you have no choice.>No one wants to pay higher taxes, but if you look at the overall quality of life of people in places you mentioned, like Sweden and Germany, it‚Äôs through the roof. **I know which one I'd prefer.**This sentiment is one of the fears of us on the right because it is incredibly short sighted. The dangers of a government that controls too much should be readily apparent to anyone with the history over the past century. When you build a system where the government controls so much and that system collapses, what happens? You might not get Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia right away... in fact things were good in Germany for a little while. Are we talking about giving as much control as they did? No, but a slow ride to hell is still a ride to hell... I might enjoy ride as we take the scenic route, but my kids? Or their kids? You're setting them up for something disastrous.Let's do a thought experiment, you are the government:You have all these people relying on government paid medical care. The situation works for some time, but you hit a few snags, having to borrow from other programs to pay for this massive one. Your population growth slows to just sustaining levels which means less tax revenue. What do you do? Raise taxes more? Who is going to pay the brunt of that? You can't just borrow from those other programs anymore, eventually you will have to come after the wealthy. This will hurt your economy, the wealthy people will leave with their money or perhaps you confiscate it with a leaving tax, or you coerce them to stay.The economy takes a hit: fewer are working = less tax revenue for your health program. Then you cut back on essentials, maybe flu shots, maybe dentistry... the quality of life stuff you used to justify this whole system. In a free market it would be relatively easy for dentists to open up and take cash, but in a controlled market it's not so simple. Quality of life suffers, confidence plummets, people complain, many try to leave.You keep looking for cost cutting measure. Medicine companies don't need to profit so much, right? So you pass a law that says they can only profit so much of their medicine. This stifles that industry in your country. Fewer jobs, less tax revenue. You start shopping elsewhere for cheaper meds, which is fine except you've just hurt your home country's industry even more: fewer jobs, less tax revenue, less confidence.It's no dystopia yet, but now you need a lot of help and things are not the same, especially now that the birthrate is approaching a rate of sustaining itself but not growth. You are in a very financially precarious position. People are not happy, but they don't have any options. Does this sound crazy? Just wait, some facts are incoming.What you pay doctors might have to change. [In Australia a surgeon makes an average of $138K](https://au.indeed.com/salaries/surgeon-Salaries), in the US a surgeon makes between [$350K and $500K](https://www.salary.com/research/salary/benchmark/surgeon-salary). So you have just disincentivized people going into the medical field. IN the UK a primary care doctor makes median salary of about [46K English pounds a year](https://www.payscale.com/research/UK/Job=Family_Physician_%2F_Doctor/Salary) which works out to about $60K a year. [In the US, a primary care physician makes around $150K](https://www.salary.com/research/salary/benchmark/family-physician-salary).If there isn't money in the job, fewer people will go for it unless it's a pleasant job. Doctors in the [UK are not happy](https://www.gponline.com/almost-half-uk-doctors-considered-quitting-amid-nhs-burnout-crisis/article/1660871). Why? More work, less pay. Basic economics, it is not worth it to become a doctor anymore, but you need MORE doctors.So you have this system that disincentivizes hard work, going to medical school, and putting in all that time. As a result, you will have fewer doctors meeting the demands of so many. longer wait times, worse care, more doctors hoping to leave. What do you do and where do you get the money to do it?At some point, the system fails. At some point things get really bad. And who is there to help? There aren't enough doctors around to just start their own private practice and offer their services for cash. You have just tampered with nature for too long and created a bottle neck, and you will need a leader to come in and clean things up. How do you think that will go? This is a huge mess, people will not be happy. What will happen?This sounds like doomsday crap, doesn't it? Except this is the trajectory of any government, and this happens much faster when the people give more and more responsibility to the government. In a free market society, yeah, sometimes you might be priced out of life saving care... but if the government fails in one or more of the many ways it CAN fail, then the market can pick up the slack and people can adapt more easily. In a controlled economy, if there is a bump in the road, the life lost can be massive.Okay, this is one industry (really it's a few), but the government usually has it's hands in many baskets. Transit, welfare, protection, policing, etc etc. What if you are facing a budget crisis with your medical system and you also happen to be having a growing crime problem, like the one that Europe seems to be facing. Now you need more cops and more doctors. you've just compounded the problem.When government has all the control over all of these things, it is dangerous. It might be great for a while, but it will fall really hard. I would rather have a system that can adapt easily over one that will collapse hard when it does, and it will collapse. This is a false narrative. What keeps happening is this:Let's say someone on the left and right do almost the same thing. The media helps the left get away with it, the left turns it around on the republicans unfairly, they get away with it. The right does it, and the media instantly jumps down their throats and demonizes the right for saying "Well wait a minute, your guy did it, too. Where was all the media coverage? If you guys are going to give your guy a pass, at the very least, we should get something out of this, too... like, say, maybe you guys stop acting like your shit doesn't stink and start reporting fairly."So that is what happens. Except in many cases it's even worse. The guy on the right is only alleged to have done something wrong, and it's not even something illegal that he did, but because the left got someone who wasn't even there to leak something, well they all must investigate. So the left acts like we're playing this whataboutism game, except that's not even close to what it is. So it's not even equivalent anymore and there are operatives willing to play hyper-partisan politics, including inventing controversies and using the media to back them up on it. So we are sitting here on the right like "What the fuck?" So we defend the president because he hasn't actually been found doing anything illegal or impeachment worthy, but the left calls us hypocrites for some reason. We call out the process for being a sham, because it is, but they say we're in denial. Anything we do they will jump down our throats, we can't even let the information come out. One of the first defenses we had was "There was no quid pro quo" in the transcript... and according to the transcript there really wasn't a quid pro quo. And we made that argument because it was valid based on the evidence at the time, and it was ironclad because if there was no quid pro quo then the left had nothing. The thing is, there can be quid pro quos, and those can be fine, it is only bad if certain criteria are met. It turns out that presidents are allowed to bargain with countries, it's one of their jobs... so quid pro quos are usually fine. The problem is that when arguing with idiots, they aren't willing to look deeper. So when it was clear that a quid pro quo existed, while not a nefarious one, the left thought that our entire argument was dead in the water. Except that was just the first piece they had to break down, the rest was even harder for them to prove. But because the media is complicit in bolstering the left, they don't care if the argument works, they just want to make people angry with the president.So I agree with you on principle, but you are making a false equivalency here. It should be as simple as you are making it, but unfortunately it isn't. The left is gaslighting the country. But they're buying American rice thanks to Trump. How is that for a trade deal, selling rice to China. So you want China to continue to gain power in the world? You are okay with them taking advantage?There is going need to be sacrifice if we are going to keep China in check. You don't seem to realize that and if a president you don't like stands up to them, you shit on it even though everyone knows it needs to happen. And you're a troll. If you don't like a sub, you know what I do? I don't go to it. I don't go into it and act like an asshole. This is part true and normally you would be completely correct. But back when the internet was really getting going, silicon valley basically promised they would uphold their platforms with the ideals of free speech. They did this in exchange for protection from the legal repercussions from users posting illegal content, be it copyrighted material, slanderous, or what have you.They have since decided that they will silence conservatives or ideas they don't agree with. So we should withhold those protections we gave them.EDIT: In other words, if you make an agreement, you must abide by it. Otherwise, you would be entirely correct. By the way, if anyone calls anyone scum, which I never really see happen except when people like you go to the sub to call us scum, then we ban them.So you are lying. You don't seem to understand language. When we say something like Muslims have been attacking the US since the beginning of the nation, that is literally true. We are not saying all Muslims, or even most Muslims. We just said Muslims. Again, I refer you to the Marine Hymn and the reference to Tripoli when Muslims were attacking our ships unprovoked.You would say the statistic that violence against Black Americans is perpetrated mostly by other Black Americans, but these are basic facts. You could make a valid statement "Black Americans keep hurting other Black Americans." That doesn't mean all Black Americans are violent, or even most. It means, relatively speaking, there is a problem with violence within the Black community. It doesn't assign blame, it doesn't deny that there have been historical factors involved. It simply states a fact. Now a racist could take that and run with it and try to stereotype with it, but just because a truth can be hijacked by racists doesn't mean we should deny it. The statistic alone doesn't stereotype Black Americans, it merely points out there is a problem with violence among the Black community. It is not because they are Black, it is cultural/societal/poverty issue. Poorer people generally have more issues with violence. That isn't racism or stereotyping, that is simply pointing out a trend, and when we do that we are doing so to face reality and consider ways to help.Just like when we say Muslim extremism is the most deadly and prevalent form of extremism now, it isn't ignoring right wing extremism, it isn't saying there is no problem with that at all. It is simply making a point about Muslim extremism. You take that as hateful because apparantly you want everyone to mention every kind of bad thing if you talk about any other kind of bad thing so no one gets their feelings hurt. That is insane, you are acting irrationally, and you should calm down.But what do I know? You think I hate people who don't look like me without knowing me or what I look like.Grow up. Lol yeah. Okay.You define hate as anything you don't like. When you demonize everyone you disagree with, all you see is demons. Grow up. Hmm, so you go into a sub to start trouble, call people names and trash the people of the sub, then you get banned, meanwhile then you pull this crap.Grow up, man. Your whole existence here is a trash ad hominem attack. What a hypocrite. You know the Marine's Hymn? "From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli"?The marines were founded before the nation began. Just after the nation began we were being attacked unprovoked by Muslims.You know the Crusades? They were a defensive war when Muslims invaded the Holy land. Not the west's best moment, but not the genocide it's made out to be.Get out of here with your trash. I have trouble watching Cosby now and there are a lot of Spacey movies I can't really watch anymore, especially comedic rolls. I love the movie The Men Who Stare At Goats, but it was hard to find Spacey funny even before all this stuff was revealed.Also he's in some trashy leftist movies. American Beauty is about a selfish prick who gets killed because he was hanging around a teenager buying drugs, and they make it sound like any military man with anger issues is secretly gay. I thought it was amazing when I saw it as a teenager, now I see it for the tripe it is. It's almost like you came here to troll and are now going to be banned. You exaggerate to a dishonest degree.Also, this subreddit doesn't ban leftist views it merely wishes to maintain this sub for republicans. We can't have a republican sub if leftists come in and do their leftist crap now can we?Saying we want to ban leftist views because we don't want to hear them in here is like saying someone is against free speech because they don't want some asshole calling their wife a whore in their home. We don't want it in our sub, but we don't want to ban it from reddit or something. That is insane, and you are a troll.Don't be daft. Goodbye. I agree on the free market push, but markets are also one of the many fronts in a war. We want them to open their markets and open free trade, we need to make it appealing to them so that a real free market deal can be reached.I imagine it's a scary time to be a farmer right now. So I don't envy you. This is a false equivelancy. As others have pointed out, the auto bailouts and bank bailouts were saving these companies from themselves and their bad behavior or anti-competitive behavior. The auto bailout actually is less problematic than the bank bailout because the automotive industry was stagnated in part by our use of tariffs. They didn't need to be competitive because of our choices.China is a threat. China is an oppressive country that is trying to wield force over all the world and subvert the west in a variety of ways. And frankly, the west does this too to some degree except we are trying to protect the freest civilization the world has ever seen, the Chinese are doing it to push more control. We will need to sacrifice as we fight the trade war with China. This doesn't justify bad behavior. It points out the hypocrisy of the left. Take care. You also like other logical fallacies and don't seem to understand how they work. There's nothing wrong with it? That's silly. You can argue it should be a private matter but to say there is nothing wrong with it is a bit too far. No one said that. The lying under oath bit was more the problem which is a little worse than just getting some in the oval office. Still though, perhaps impeachment should not have been pursued. This only extends so far. Unfortunately with reddit leaning the way it does, subs like this, if they allow too many non-conservative or non-republican types in for civil debate, it floods the conversation and turns it into r/politics eventually anyway. This is why we say that this is a sub for and by republicans and why we have the warning under pretty much every post as well as the leftist talking point rule and our rule 11. People who are not republicans are welcome insofar as they respect that. Sometimes we have to ban perfectly nice people to maintain this place for republicans. > The rise of ANTIFA is an indication itself that certain individuals have that thought.You are stating here that it is a valid thought to have.And you have now pushed your luck with the other comments. You are using mental gymnastics to basically validate stupid ideas that wealth inequality is a problem.You are literally saying that wealth inequality is a problem because people think it is a problem. The problem isn't the wealth inequality, it is the people being delusional. That is the problem.Addressing a trend because people are delusional is a stupid move. Please do not validate ANTIFA's views in here. Report leftist comments please. >Extreme wealth inequality will turn this country into a war zone and push more people to extreme left views. Actually, that is not entirely true. Under almost every post we have a comment that this is for Republicans. I am a mod, I know these things. Evidence. He went on Epstein's plane once, and that was to go to his home in Miami. This is not true. You just read that into the video that you only watch 3 seconds of. But you are not a Republican. You should be doing this in r/politics, not here.Where on earth did you get the idea that the right wants to forbid leftist views? How? The extremely wealthy pay the vast majority of taxes. The French Revolution was the opposite, the poor paid for everything while the higher classes did nothing to help. If there is a war, it is because idiots don't know what they are tlaking about... And how on earth would you fix this problem you say exists? Give the man props? He was a bum and somehow this man with the charisma of a bottle of Pepto Bismol became a senator and is now pushing an agenda of socialism that breeds more laziness while demanding everything. This is partly true, the new liberal, which is not really liberal, has nothing in common with conservatives. True liberals have tons in common with conservatives.If leftists just stopped, we would all be in great shape. There was a time when both sides agreed on the fundamentals. We don't anymore. The left now wants to dismantle the fundamentals thinking they are saving us. We wish to plow ahead trusting the fundamentals knowing that there are better ways to handle the problems we have.There is sort of a logical fallacy happening lately, a false equivalency that this hyper-partisanship was caused by both sides. Nope, it was caused by the extreme left, the rest of the left started getting on board, and finally the right woke up.It's like the Israel and Palestine. If Palestine put down their guns, there would be peace. If Israel did, they would be run over. If the left stopped this madness, we would be fine. If we stop, we will perish. I don't like it at all and we need to be really careful, but if we stop, we lose the whole country and the left will drive this country into the ground. The problem with this now is that one party aids and abets an extreme leftism either quietly, with policy that continues to push toward that, or loud and proud.While I agree with you in spirit, one side is actually asserting a fundamental shift in the foundations of this country. Certainly there are problems in both camps, but there needs to be an intellectual purge of leftism before we can put those heads together. Excuse me? We watched him like a hawk, but we didn't invent stuff to get him. Why is wealth inequality is a problem? So shills are people who don't make final judgments until all the evidence is in... gotcha. Yeah, it's messed up. I think your point though makes it more likely it was suicide, though. If he tried, failed, and really wanted to, he would wait, pretend he's okay, and do it when he's less likely to be stopped. The camera issue is more convenient, to be honest. Suicidal people who have committed to it will bide their time if necessary.Whatever the case, I think this debate is less important than the rest of the details. We know some big people in politics worked and played with Epstein. Arguing about whether he killed himself or not is kinda distracting from the fact there was a pedophile island. I think he committed suicide, but I make the argument more because I think this debate should cancel itself out. There are bigger fish to fry. So I make this argument more to assert that suicide is as plausible as murder so we can focus on the bigger issues.Check out [this article](https://gothamist.com/news/prisoners-endure-a-nightmare-gulag-in-lower-manhattan-hidden-in-plain-sight) from The Gothamist in 2018, before Epstein was ever there. There was also a 2017 article from the NYTimes that talked about it while El Chapo was there but it's behind a paywall. The conditions at this place are terrible. Suicide rates are sky rocketing and have been for years in pretty much all prisons. It's over capacity by like 50% or more. It's rat and insect infested. It's where we put a ton of terrorist suspects awaiting trial. It's where we put El Chapo and where he started having auditory hallucinations, allegedly due to the stress of being there. It is understaffed, and the staff that are there are pretty brutal, which is probably in part due to the conditions they have to deal with as well. Epstein should have been kept somewhere else being so high profile. And you would think that there would be a more strict procedure for someone like him, but this is the government we're talking about.  These are not run like the Marine Corps, these are run like the DMV. There are other articles about how the suicide watch bedding isn't effective... there are examples of people on suicide watches in prisons being able to kill themselves, too, and Epstein wasn't actually on suicide watch at the time.I think a more important thing to look at is the investigation. We haven't heard a peep yet and just yesterday the UK decided it [won't investigate](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/28/london-police-defend-decision-to-drop-jeffrey-epstein-investigation). We hear rumors that many people are implicated, that things might be bad for some top politicians, but where is all of this? It's been 4 months. We see a leaked video of that ABC news chick saying she "got Clinton" or something, well what did she mean? That he went to the island? That she has videos? If she had videos, why not send them elsewhere when he story was canned by the higher ups at ABC? It wet our appetites yet again, it certainly makes it seem like something is going on... and yet what is it? So my point is that Epstein's suicide/murder is sort of immaterial here, I'm more concerned with a possible international pedophile, human trafficking ring or maybe the CIA and other intelligence agencies using this horrible place to gain intel or leverage for some covert, black ops kind of stuff.So I see a few possible narratives here these should be more ambiguous than they are, they are just meant to form a basic idea:1) **Arrogant Epstein With Little to No Evidence**: Epstein was a creep who rubbed elbows with the elites, extorted some, was fairly careful, but also arrogant and not careful enough. He gets caught, knows he doesn't have enough info to go free, can't deal with the stress in that horrible prison and kills himself. In this situation, he doesn't have enough info to really hurt anyone, there might be some temporary embarrassment, but most people involved just slink away unscathed thinking it better to let this die than to risk getting caught in a cover up.2) **Paranoid Epstein Has Some Evidence**: Epstein kept videos, photos, and documents of many of his clients for the thrill and for safety. This Epstein might have a document release that is triggered by his death for protection. This would make people think twice about putting a hit on him. I think this would be enough to keep from being murdered in prison, but he would kill himself knowing that this was the end for him, there was too much evidence against him now, too much public awareness and his friends would probably abandon him. This still makes you wonder who scooped up all the computers from the island... And having a document release trigger is wildly speculative, but it is something a paranoid person would do for protection.3) **Epstein The Asset**: Epstein's alleged connection to the CIA is true. The CIA and/or other intelligence sectors of the government caught wind of Epstein and began using him for multiple purposes, sort of creating the honeypot of all honeypots for espionage. Considering that Clinton already has been known to go to the island, other leaders probably would as well. The CIA would have an interest in ensuring that our former president is kept relatively clear from harm because if he was found to be involved in the trafficking rather than just taking part in the debauchery, it would destabilize our government. So the CIA uses this to get dirt and to keep an eye. Epstein continues to do what he has been doing after he is caught and slapped on the wrists and then released, and we get a ton of intel to use or withhold as whomever has it sees fit. No one would need to kill him in this scenario because all the dirt is locked down and Epstein would know that, which would probably speed up the choice to kill himself. The rumors he was murdered would actually serve their purposes because while we argue about this, they have some time to clean up their tracks.4) **The Pawn of Some Spectre-like Organization**: I consider this one to be one of the least likely. I'm convinced there is a cabal of some kind of wealthy and powerful individuals, perhaps there are a couple competing ones in the world, who really knows? But I don't think they operate even remotely as that James Bond movie depicts. There is however evidence of some human trafficking on a pretty large scale that I think is interconnected or related to some degree, we need only look to the Chinese organ harvesting networks to know that these networks can and do exist. Intelligence must know this exists, and some elites likely allow or even control it. Whether such an organization does this or not in the scale I think they do is the question. Anyway, in this case, Epstein is basically a mid level pusher, he's not going to the Builderburg meetings, he's not privy to that stuff, he's just a guy who could hustle at the high society level and achieve a sort of low level access to that world of elites. He doesn't really know enough to do any damage, they just keep him along because he does the dirty work and they can easily wipe their hands clean of him. He would know he has no real power with them, that he has no evidence to really use against them, and that he would be on his own at trial. The worst he could have likely done is turned on Prince Andrew and Bill Clinton and we already basically know about them... so he'd kill himself.5) **Epstein *Was* Murdered/Silenced By Wealth Elite Types**: If Epstein was murdered, they would have to go to people within that prison. The money isn't the question, it's the logistics. In the Metropolitan Correctional Facility, there are a lot of terrorism suspects, a lot of lawyers going in and out, etc. Who are you going to get? Which guards are you going to talk to? Who won't talk? What do you offer them? Murders are pretty easy to solve in prison and keep in mind, these are all people in the middle of a trial or about to go to trial. Most of them probably just want to keep their heads down while their trial happens. Not only that, but this would be a prison with a fairly high turn over rate, it's not a permanent facility, it's a temporary place. You can end up their for years, but that's not what it's for. This would make it even harder to find an individual to use for a hit.6) **Epstein Was Murdered By Some Random Dude For No Reason**: Considering Epstein was a pedophile and pedophiles often get pummeled in prison and considering how everyone knew this about him, it seems very likely that if he was murdered, it was simply because one of the guys wanted to take out a pedophile. You would think that this murderer wouldn't care if it looked like a murder or a suicide, so I don't like this scenario.I think it was a mix of 2 and 3 and that suicide looked like the only way out for him at the time. Whatever the case, any of these scenarios warrants investigation into the greater conspiracy, who was involved in the island, why the CIA seemed to be involved, what evidence is lying around, all that stuff. I hear ya. But I think it is more plausible than people are making it. I feel like if there was a plot it would more be a "look the other way" kinda plot rather than a straight murder plot.Also, for the record, I didnt down vote you. I dont think I've ever downvoted you. I think you make a valid point. Ok, I didnt say it was the best experiment, but it did seem to test whether the force necessary to break fracture those vertebrae was achievable. He is a dude who thinks Epstein didn't kill himself, but he admitted that could be wrong.This is the point. Not that it was a great experiment. Also, people like you like to take the general idea of experimentation and then force the scientific community definition onto it to discredit the point. I never claimed it followed the scientific method well. But being a Trump guy and then admitting it might not have been murder is noteworthy.Why are you being a jerk?EDIT: oh I see, you are a lefty troll. You do have to pick words that fit. But often they don't fit. I mean if you're just looking to practice, then go for it.But if you look at Shakespeare's sonnet 18, in its first line you see that even he did not make all his words fit strictly into iambic pentameter when we read it.Shall I compare thee to a Summer's day?It's 10 syllables in iambic pentameter but no one reads it that way. It's usually read thusly:Shall I com**pare** thee **to** a **Sum**mer's **day**?Again, like my line, the first three syllables build to "pare". "To" is very softly emphasized and you might even say that neither "to" not "a" are emphasized. So the line reads more like this:u u u / u u u / u /You can easily read it in strict iambic pentameter, but it sounds clunky when we do. While the circumstances around his death are certainly suspicious, I think it is still very reasonable to assume he committed suicide. Steven Crowder did a test to see if it was possible to commit suicide and exert the force required to see the fractures found in the autopsy. He found that it was possible. (I love the guy but man was that a weird episode of his show).Anyway, he didnt even test a pretty simple way to get the leverage Epstein would have needed by rolling of the top bunk and falling to the floor with his nose wrapped around his neck. That would have created a lot of force and disoriented him in such a way that might prevent him from recovering even if we wanted to.There are tons of stories about federal and state prisons not having the funding to adequately run the prisons. This would bleed into problems with technology upkeep, problems with finding good employees, problems with over working employees, etc. There were also stories from 2012 or so about how the prison suicide watch gear failed at preventing suicides. There are also reports of other people on suicide watch being able to commit suicide.I have a comment that is pretty well sourced in my history, I will link to it in a bit. I feel like there are a lot of good answers, but as a non-native speaker, I wonder if it is a bit more than you need.When I read or write a poem in iambic pentameter, I don't force the rhythm. In other words, I don't read a word unnaturally just for it to fit iambic pentameter.There is a sort of fallacy that comes with the idea of stressed and unstressed syllables because it is more complicated than that.Look at the word avacado. When we naturally say it, it follows iambic pentameter: **a**va**ca**do. That feels correct and yet the **a** and **ca** are not usually equally stressed. The **ca** syllable typically has a stronger stress than the **a**. So that should tell us that iambic pentameter isn't as cut and dry as we were taught in school. It can often feel wrong to read iambic pentameter strictly into a line, even sometimes when the syllables all fit perfectly into the meter.The way the author writes will usually inform a naturally iambic pentameter reading as opposed to a more naturally reading. In other words, I tend to read the words as written and try not to force the feel of the iambic pentameter unless it naturally flows, or maybe to subtly mark the end of a line.There is a tension between the form of iambic pentameter and the natural stresses of the words used within a line of iambic pentameter. This adds to the depth or meaning of the poem, or simply the aesthetics/sounds of it.I have a line of poetry that kinda shows this. It's sort of free verse but whenever I talk about the subject of the rose in the poem, I return to iambic tetrameter... this is the first line:*She was a rose that bent my ear.*How do you read it?She **was** a **rose** that **bent** my **ear**OrShe was a **rose** that **bent** my **ear**I read "she was a" in a staccato sort of way that builds to "rose", which is emphasized and a touch lengthened, and then "that bent my ear" is read in traditional iambs.It's still technically iambic tertrameter, but read without strictly following that.I often think of it less as meter and more as rhythm within a melody.Anyway, my point is that I would read naturally. A good writer will inform a strict reading within the selected meter or if there is supposed to be more fluidity. This is needlessly cynical. Conservative values? Which ones? Free speech? Because we believe that a government shouldn't step in to control speech, and we feel it is hypocritical of websites or companies that claim to support free speech on their platforms (and even get legal protections from government by promising they would uphold free speech) and then ban speech they don't agree with.In a sub that we operate, we are entitled to kick people out who are trolling with their speech, just as you would be entitled to kick someone out of your hope for calling your wife a whore. Are you anti-free-speech for that? No. Stop conflating free speech with this idea that we have to let any idiot come in here and say whatever they want. This is stupid. Those are all things that help everyone. Your college degree doesn't help me, your health care doesn't help me. If you want to try and argue that  the aggregate of everyone having health care and everyone having college degrees would benefit me, you would have to prove also that the detriments those free things have cost us netted us a gain. In other words, socialized medicine has been a disaster and has led to massive cost increases for individuals. Free college just costs tax payers, it doesn't benefit them to pay for everyone to go to college.If you want to pay for people to go to college, start some gofundme campaigns and leave us out of it. By the way, this is how we have typically handled this... you know, if someone needs some help, we pool our resources through voluntary action rather than through threat of force, which is how government works.Take care. Nope. You over estimate the joy moderators get from this. It was merely a warning, one you didn't heed. Take care. I'm also a moderator, so calm it down. She came from that, did she not? It's like you haven't heard of Rockefeller or Ford or all the steel and gas barons.... we got along fine without CEOs? What the hell do you think went on in the past? So you're a dick, gotcha. The dramatic irony here is that everyone reading this is aware of your tactics but you are not. This is also situationally ironic. Here is some verbal irony: you are *so* good at irony. Please explain the irony because I am something of an expert in the area of irony and it sounds to me like you are stating that without quite knowing what it is that is so ironic. It would, but why dont you believe it? That would be an effect of it.I think the best answer is simply that it is just one of many polls. But you seem to be discounting it entirely rather than taking it as a sign that some change is indeed happening. And we know there is some significant change just from the way black Americans are talking. Tell me. What is bad about income inequality?If there weren't people like Bezos making the moves and taking the risks to make a massive company, then thousands and thousands of people wouldn't have jobs. Not only that, but a lot of the worth of these billionaires is locked up in their owned properties and such. It's not like they just have billions lying around. Most of that money is invested in the company and serves the company, which in turn pays all those salaries.If we didn't have billionaires, we'd have even poorer poor.And consider this, the poor in this nation have access to food, shelter, and clothing if they need it through charity and through government. So if you have someone making 0 dollars, that person has more access to all kinds of goods and services than any other poor person in the world. Why? Largely because business thrives so well here and we allow our people to become as wealthy as they do, which in turn gives money to many other people who work for those compais, and all of these people pay taxes or donate their money to organizations that help the poor. So this idea of income inequality being bad is silly. Your comment is silly. Just because google tried to stop a labor union from forming you think life isn't decent for those people? That's silly.Labor unions are often about power, and I dont mean the power of the owner over the people. It's a power grab from special interests trying to push the company to do what the special interest wants.Labor unions had a purpose, they are mostly about labor people getting power now. Shoving it in their face? Remember when Kanye came out in support of Trump and some conservative values and we all watched like "damn, this is weird and new"? And then people started shitting on him and we all kinda thought, "Kanye, you're crazy. But give'em hell!"? Do you remember the left suddenly saying that we are hypocrites because they projected onto us the behavior we criticized them for? But do you remember how we weren't doing what they do, we were merely finding it remarkable that a celebrity of his status would make such a huge shift in his thinking?We weren't just clapping for a celebrity saying the things we are all thinking. We were supporting the freedom of thought it represented.We have a similar case here. We aren't just blindly trusting the polls, in fact we are still highly skeptical. But it is noteworthy to see some polls showing a drastic significant shift in support.Do not make this out to be something it isn't. I saw that to you, someone who claims this is us blindly trusting, and to those who think these polls mean more than they do. But right now in the thread, it seems there are more of the former than the latter. Yes, the article says two polls,  ot all polls, we are aware. Thank you so much for attempting to correcting thinking that you think is wrong.It's funny, you probably posted this with a smirk on your face like "I'll show these idiots" the irony being you wasted your love doing so and probably doing so more than just this considering you have an alt account. It is ironic, in case you couldn't tell, because that is a fucking stupid way to behave in life. Certainly, but this poll is noteworthy at least. It's kinda like how we don't give a shit about celebrities and their opinions, and that is true regardless of what they believe. However it is still noteworthy, interesting, and telling when a celebrity comes out as Republican/conservative or just not Democrat.This is the same thing, we should take it with a grain of salt, but it is noteworthy and perhaps telling. While I don't trust the polls, I also don't think they just straight up lie. Why? https://images.app.goo.gl/hKZia19MPK8jZSV2ADammit, it's supposed to link to a Key & Peele gif from the grown ass man sketch. I don't think that's necessarily true. There are a lot of black Trump supporters who see Obama as someone who really didn't care or help. That's because you are a racist who thinks black people have no individual thoughts. Whatever race you are, this is a racist way to think. On a scale from non racist(0) to KKK(10) your comment is only about a 1.5, but it's still racist. Is there an issue here? It's a helluva leap in the context. Your comment is needlessly nitpicky. It's actually the greatest time to be born into. You can have anything delivered to your door, cancer rates are on the decline, we have seen unprecedented peace. Most of the problems everyone complains about are either entirely fabricated or are mountains made from molehills. The government is not the community. Bezos is. Your thinking is backwards. "You¬†Democrats!¬†You blew it up! Ah,¬†damn you! God¬†damn you¬†all to hell!" This is true but I think it misses a more important factor. Most cities have a center that is relatively thriving and have a lot of places people would bus into for work. So buses would be used more within the city and then the bus company would have the funds to offer more routes out to surrounding areas. It seems that our city followed this path but then the city kinda rotted, so that healthy base of income weakened a lot and left the company with fewer options and limited service.  This didn't help down town, and so the buses were even less useful.Why send a bus along the same route every 10 minutes when it is barely worth it to send one every 40 minutes? It's not semantics. You can be a hypocrite about something and not be a "hypocrite", just like you can lie about something and not be labeled a "liar". The point was hypocritical. I didn't say the man was. You are moving the goalposts again and disregarding the point by waving it off as semantics. The point was that his point was hypocritical, it was. The war of words is one of the most important aspects of this fight that few people are talking about. I want to start a podcast that is largely about how we communicate and how it has changed. Agreed. This is short sighted. The distinction is that the right to own guns is a promise of something the government won't do to infringe upon your life and your ability to defend yourself.This tweet points out that the way the left uses the term "right" will just expand to more commodities... it starts with help for the elderly (social security), then it went to helping the poor and the elderly with their medical care. These weren't rights, this was a charitable endeavor that became an expectation, and thus the term "right" was easily applied because you had a legitimate claim to those funds.They just promise and dangerously create the desire for free stuff from the government.You can fend for yourself, you can create a life for yourself, you can be independent, feed yourself, clothe yourself, house yourself, build a family yourself. You do not need the government. He was a hypocrite on this point, by making his statement he was acting as if his country didn't do the exact same thing. That is hypocritical. Making it "personal" moves the goal posts so that you can shut my point down because you don't like it. I didn't make it personal because he did not.He is personally a hypocrite on this point in regards to his stance on countries, in regards to his own behavior, we could debate whether he has always selected the right thing, but that was not the point.Take care. Yes, but we are talking about countries, not individuals. This quote is about the US as a whole.You do realize that, right? This is one of those quotes that can be applied to any country. England appeased Hitler repeatedly after watching him take more and more land. England only jumped in when they had to. So it's kind of a trashy, hypocritical thing for Churchill to say. I don't think this is accurate but it is also not entirely crazy. China does exert a ton of control over their industry, it is not exactly a command economy but I might call it a demanding one. In other words, there is a ton of commie red tape to get through.The Chinese government didn't like how TikTok (which was called something else there iirc) glorified bad behavior among their youth. According to [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-china-cracked-down-on-the-social-media-giant-bytedance), there were instances of teenage girls competing about who could get pregnant at an earlier age. That is fucked up and that is what the internet often does, it brings us to our most base behaviors. While in the West, we try to combat that with social means, China exerts its massive government force on such things, so the company had to crack down on that stuff.The thing is, China is okay with the money that an app like that could make... overseas. And they are more than okay with the degradation of culture in other countries. It's a bit like the Opium Wars, when Great Britain didn't want that shit in their country, but they were more than okay with selling it in China.I mean there could be spyware in there but I don't think the Chinese care that much about actually spying on what teenagers in US schools are doing specifically. But I'm sure there are content with knowing and having data on how many of our teens are wasting time in school doing this stuff. In fairness, it can be hard to break down how much of a dick someone was being in the space provided. Sometimes there's a history of shitty behavior that adults kinda shrug off because they think "what am I going to say? He meowed in geometry class every time someone said obtuse?" That sounds like a stupid thing to write someone up for on the surface, meanwhile, in the class it is incredibly distracting, disruptive, and disrespectful to the teacher. Something like that is almost never the only inappropriate thing that that kid does in class, but it might be the most recent thing that really hurt the learning environment and you need to do something to get him to cut it out.Also, parents don't give a shit anymore. It's ridiculous. So knowing that, a lot of teachers just put up with a ton of shit they wouldn't have put up with 30 years ago. While there are some ridiculous referrals and reasons for detention out there, the situation is getting harder for teachers just because parents aren't cracking skulls when their kid is being a jerk in school. We know kids will he kids, but ffs if your kid is pulling shit in class, don't wave it off like it's nothing. Take appropriate action, it doesn't  have to be much "now you know you can't pull that in class, if I hear about you doing this again, you will be grounded." And then, if they do it again, ground them. It isn't hard. Nothing here suggests anyone thought otherwise. Don't be a troll. TL;DR the show is dope. I don't want to shill for Disney, but they are doing the original trilogy Star Wars justice here.I didn't have high hopes for it considering the franchise has gone way down hill with this new trilogy, also because this massive universe expanding practice that Marvel has been doing has left me disappointed a lot of the time, so seeing Star Wars try it I was like "here we go again".But this show was written and created by Jon Favrau and he made it a space western. The western genre is perfect for the bounty hunter Mandalorian. They pulled a lot from westerns for the recent Logan movie and that was one of the best X-Men universe movies in forever.Anyway, the show is really well done. They aren't doing what Abrams did with Star Wars and making constant nods to the original trilogy or trying to revive the past. Even the stylistic choices of a screen whipes and those typical opening shots in the films has been subdued to offer a more unique feel while still feeling very much Star Wars. It is pushing into the untapped lore of the Mandalorians and doing something new using hints from the past. They immediately established a ruthless character who is conflicted between his code and his compassion, revealing a heart within.I mean it's only two episodes in, so it could go down hill so fast. But so far it looks like Favrau is treating this with a lot of care and passion, and rather than Marvel taking a genre and beating it into the ground, here we seem to have a universe that is being developed as a rich setting that can be home to multiple genres. They were poking fun at tiktok if I recall correctly. Of course. I found it funny, by the way. Ladies and gentlemen, and those who are being needlessly critical of this. You do realize that these people are young, correct? Why would you just dump on young conservatives and republicans who are trying to stand up in the culture to a media that is utterly dominated by the left? Not only that, but how many of you were hilarious as high school students? How many of you find everything you found funny then as funny as you remember?Cut them some slack. Be encouraging. You don't have to praise everything but ffs don't just shit on it. You're doing what the left is doing and helping beat our future comedians, our future cultural warriors, and our future spokespeople into the ground before they even fully develop their voices.EDIT: Also, folks, please don't feed the trolls. If you don't like content simply because it doesn't resonate with you, downvote and move on. Let's either be the adults we are or model adult behavior for those who are not. Stay strong and keep your head down when you need to. So you are really encouraging on r/nofap, why come here and shit on some teenagers trying to meme? They're teenagers. Reddit has a lot of young people on it. And these are obviously high school students making the video. It is very likely the poster is a high school student or very young.How much stuff that you found funny in high school is funny now? How often do you look back at how you attempted to be funny in high school and thing "man, that actually was legitimately funny!" We are a community, and while I'm all for criticism when it is due, you should also have some understanding that these are young conservatives and republicans and that just shitting on them rather than encouraging them to do even better is not a good thing to do. I agree that the allegations as Schiff described when he was describing the phone call as a  mob shake down during that initial hearing would be impeachable. I do not agree that the specific details you describe are impeachable, they require more evidence.What you are doing here is what the democrats are doing. Here is an example. Would you agree to arrest u/noahcallaway-wa if there were evidence to show that:1) u/noahcallaway-wa picked up a product at Target with the intent to take it home2) u/noahcallaway-wa did not pay for the product upon leaving target.Would you support that arrest? Would you support losing your job over that? Or might you think that tan alternative narrative might exist?Does that constitute theft? These are parts of theft that usually occur, but this does not define theft. An alternative narrative to you stealing is that you went into Target to get a product, and you simply forgot to pay for it. Maybe you exchanged something for it so you didn't technically pay for it, maybe the product was free. Maybe you complained to the manager about something and you should have paid for it but you complained so aggressively that they just comped it.The thing is we are defining theft now simply by saying 1) you intended to take something home, and 2) you didn't pay for it upon leaving.The Democrats would say you committed theft and should be fired from you job and convicted to the fullest extent of the law. I would need to know if you actually intended to steal the product, whatever the case it, the story doesn't look great, but the narrative the democrats push is impeachable, the narratives that make you look bad are not... they just make you look bad.You can't break this down as simply as you did, and this shows the dishonesty of the argument.Alternative narrative is obvious, Trump makes a congratulatory phone call. The basics of the relationship between the US and Ukraine come up. Trump shoots the breeze about various things including asking them to look into the Russian election meddling (that was the crowdstrike stuff that the dems and everyone have wanted him to investigate). And he also brings up the Bidens because there are rumors of corruption, and considering we have an international anti-corruption treaty with about 160 countries signing onto it (including the Ukraine and the US, 2003, look it up), such an investigation would be valid even despite the person being a nominee and should be done even without Trump asking. Was it wrong? Maybe, but mostly because it looks bad. It's like saying you aren't a racist cop and then arresting a black person. You aren't a racist cop and this particular black person just committed theft, but people will still look at it as suspicious because you just said it.Lastly, your second bullet point biases the facts into your narrative already. Meaning that you feel it has been proven that the withholding of the aid was actually contingent on the investigation. In other words, you are inserting intent that you cannot prove into a "fact". Your fact is actually an opinion. Here is a simple alternative to that:You are withholding aid to make sure things the receivers of the aid will do what they are supposed to. You make a phone call, it sounds bad and a rumor made by someone who wasn't even there is leaked to the public. It didn't mean what the media claims you meant, from their perspective you are a traitor, in truth, you really just lack tact. Now, you are still withholding the aid for valid reasons, then the media latches onto the story because they hate you. The story isn't going away. So you release the aid, not because you wanted to make some covert deal, but because there is now no good time to release the aid. If you release it just as the story is breaking, you look like you are doing it to avoid looking bad, if you hold onto it everyone will think you just didn't get what you wanted. The truth is still that you were trying to make sure they would be using these anti-corruption funds to fight corruption. This isn't whataboutism, all the Republicans I have spoken with agree that impeachment should be on the table if there is really evidence of wrongdoing as Schiff claims. Drawing comparisons between this and the email scandal is totally valid when talking about the double standard and the value of this investigation. Whataboutism is when you use one to distract from the other. It's a form of a red herring, I am not attempting to distract. But people are overly sensitive to that these days so they just dismiss ideas they don't like.And yes, there are different statutes for intent, but in the court of public opinion the argument is less refined and that is primarily what people are talking about. The Democrats are trying to slay Trump in the court of public opinion, they have neither statute of intent so far in the actual investigation. This has largely been a failure on their part because Adam Schiff looks so manipulative in all of this despite the media being on board this whole time.Again, the double standard is important here. So many Democrats said Hillary did absolutely nothing wrong, but she was horribly negligent and knew she was not doing what she was supposed to do. Those are facts and yet these opinions of her having done no wrong hold even now for so many, long after all the facts came out. They aren't seemingly willing to admit she did anything wrong at all. Here however most Republicans will tell you this is not becoming behavior of any president despite the fact they all do it. But the facts currently do not create a narrative the Democrats wish they did.So my point is that if the Democrats are going to so blatantly fail to assert standards, especially within what even many Democrat voters think is a witch hunt, then there is something wrong and the Dems in DC are apparently not interested in the rule of law, they just want power. Republicans have every right to be angered by this even though they largely agree the president has not acted as perfectly as he claims he has.This is not whataboutism, every Republican I have spoken with is for impeachment if the facts show he really abused his power in the way Schiff claims he did. When it came to Comey and Hillary, intent was the reason he decided not to recommend prosecution. The Democrats were fine with that. The difference between these two cases are many, but one involved something most presidents do, and the other involves gross negligence that resulted in state secrets and classified material being leaked to enemies..I'm not trying to whatabout here, my point is simply that if the standard is intent, then that standard should be relatively consistent. Withholding some money to ensure the investigation of corruption or negligently spilling secrets to all our enemies on a consistent basis for months and months? If the intent of Hillary mattered but Trump's does not, you have a bad double standard.Frankly, I think what Hillary did is far worse, to try and get Trump on this shows a clear double standard and a manipulation of the rule of law for political gain by the Democrata. They should be very careful. You are kinda half right.If murder is wrong and we say it is illegal, if jury after jury fails to convict a clear case of breaking the law, then the law doesn't exist.So in some ways it is a check and balance, but this check was not an intentional one. The jury is supposed to decide based on the law not what they want the law to be. That responsibility is the legislature's alone.Basically, this becomes a form of mob rule and it would come back to bite us. If someone everyone loved, or someone who maybe one party really loved was murdered but the jury was stacked with people who hated him or her, then they might just say "yeah, I don't think this is murder". While it doesn't nullify the law legislatively, it nullifies it in effect. Imagine this being done if Obama were the victim, and then if Trump were the victim. If one feels okay and the other does not, that is why this is an issue. True, but I also doubt they'll be creating truly ageist content either. Times certainly are different, and the past couple generations don't fully appreciate or realize the issues that have come up.However, that wisdom that comes with age is always true. You learn so much about what is really important, you learn about realationships, you learn about what has substance and what is empty. This wisdom comes only from experience, and this is so true that it sounds to many like a bullshit cliche (especially to the young), but it isn't. There are so many youthful endeavors that are utterly void of value or meaning. There are also many youthful endeavors that are valid but are pursued in a very narrow way, and the passion brought to it is narrow and dangerous.We see this with the environment. That is a valid cause, but there are many aspects to this cause and many ways to combat the issues or environmental degradation and climate change. The passion blinds people to better alternatives and this is led by young people such as Greta Thurnberg, so instead of listening to valid criticisms of current tactics, they just demonize anyone who speaks against carbon credits and giving up power to an international, unelected supplementary government.And one of the things that drives this is the youthful perception that wisdom is slow. This is not really true, wisdom is efficient, it acts purposefully when it ought and the actions tend to be highly effective. That said, the older generations dont always act with wisdom. I don't think it is the same. For some people it is, sure. But there is some hatred behind a lot of it for a lot of young people who act as if the boomers ruined everything.I just got into an argument last week where the person categorized the "greatest generation" as a PTSD addled group that terrorized their wives and children when they came back from the war, and that the boomers weren't much better.There is some nasty ageism that is cropping up amongst the younger folks.When older people make fun of younger people, they are doing it from a point of relative wisdom. Young people do not have wisdom generally speaking, that is a truth as old as time. It is almost endearing them as the foolish young people they are, pointing out that life will humble them.This ok boomer stuff may have an endearing aspect to it, but I think it mostly stems from an anger and a hatred. While I hate the idea of using this meme/phrase... sometimes sitcoms are a way to help heal. I could easily see this being a show where the young person realizes the older person has some wisdom. They did destroy cable, now you can get a la cart options. Why would you buy all of those anyway? The new series is between return of the jedi and the force awakens. The quid pro quo argument is old news. Quid pro quo happens all the time. The question is this an illegal quid pro quo or an impeachable quid pro quo. No, arguing with a dishonest person means the dishonest person will dishonestly avoid the argument in a variety of ways just as you have already done. Take care. I think it should be noted where exactly that disdain (I don't know that hate is accurate) comes from. You make an excellent point as someone preaching to the choir, but for those who may not be conservative and seeing this, the family unit is a sort of basic unit of society.The family unit is an archetype with a father and a mother who serve each other and the family as a sort of single entity, and then the children are both students of the parents and servants of the parents. And when I say servants, I do not mean servants in the authoritarian sense, I mean in the team sense. In a team, each person serves the team I their role, the leader of the team makes sure each person in the team has what they need and each person serves the leader to make sure the leader has what he or she needs. It's reciprocal service and it is voluntary. This is a natural model, but it is also the Judeo-Christian model.The left I think generally accepts this model as beneficial and support it. But they also see it is something to disdain for 2 reasons on two different levels. On the personal level, they see it as an affront to those who do not have traditional sexual desires. They see the reverence for the traditional family above all other forms of families as hurtful to those other forms of families. They are very much supporters of the underdog, but they take it too far and will twist the truth in subtle ways. So if we say a family with a mother and a father is the best model for a family, they will immediately cite instances when the father was abusive and it was better for the mother to leave with the kids, and they see our assertion as invalidating the difficult work a single mother might do. They then glorify the idea of single parenthood, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but when commitment seems to mean so little today and when so little focus is put on the service aspect of parenthood, it adds to the divorce rate and leaves families unstable. Clearly a mother and father are a better fit.They will also act as if this claim is homophobic and immediately cite that a loving gay couple can raise children better than an abusive straight couple. It's the same argument. Some situations can work, but one situation is best: a loving mother and father relationship where the father serves to provide the basic physical needs and the mother serves to provide the more nurturing needs.So there is that level of disdain, but there is a second level of disdain that comes from those who think more about power and rule. They disdain the family because the family unit is the basic building block of a strong and free society. Almost all oppressive regimes will impede the basic family unit in one way or another to break the unit and make their people more malleable. Historically this has been done in abrupt and violent ways, but today it is done in subtle, cultural ways.Perhaps the king or Pharoah ordered the first born son murdered, perhaps they called them to a needless war or to some other kind of service. Perhaps they called the women to some kind of needless service. Hitler separated the women from the men during the final solution. If men saw what was being done to their wives, daughters, and sister, they would be much less prone to uprising.Today, there is seemingly some kind of concerted effort... my Christian background seems to think it is in part a spiritual effort, but it is at least in part the work of some political thinkers. And this effort works in much less obvious ways. The sexual revolution which was spun as a great moment in our history, led to people putting far too much emphasis on sexuality and selfish endeavors than on commitment and family. So after that, divorce, infidelity, and perversion ruined many families. With fewer families together, children were more susceptible to their urges, which led to more families being started out of wed lock. We look at that as a perceived taboo, but the reason is because it leads to an unstable beginning to a child's life, making them more susceptible to dependence. And that is the key here.Families are largely self sufficient, they of course need their greater communities, but the government? Not so much. This limits the power that government can take, but the more people you have that are needy and have no strong community ties to help them, the more the people are prone to rely on the government and the more power the government can take.By destroying the family, they rot the US from the inside, manufacturing a crisis that leads to the perceived need for government intervention and a more and more oppressive government. And then they'll hit the rest of the eastern block. You argue dishonestly, you aren't worth the time. You just took what I said and twisted it far beyond what I said.Also, you miss characterize the past a lot. You know you are, too.>That's very different from pointing out the faults of the previous generation.This is true, but you say that is if this is the behavior you see on reddit. It is not. The ageism that is happening is alarming and the blame that is put on the older generations is lunacy. Right here in this comment of yours you act as if the PTSD from fighting a war to literally save the world, and somehow used it to abuse their kids? What kind of fucked up history are you reading? This is actually a fairly new idea and it started back in the 60s. Prior to that, everyone was taught to respect their elders, and that while our elders may have faulty understandings of things, they have wisdom and experience we do not.A culture where the youth fails to revere the elderly is one that is dying. No, I understand what you are doing. You are doing what the dems hope everyone is doing which is believing they the us enough hearsay and 4th hand testimony that people will think something nefarious happened.You are actually incorrect about witnesses rarely coming to testify and giving enough damning evidence to prove something. Or perhaps you needed to specify that it is rare for a trial to convict someone *without* such testimony. You are excusing a lack of evidence. Sometimes a successful conviction does not have one single witness to convince a jury and rather there are many minor witnesses. That is true and that is what you seem to be implying this is, except it isn't. In those cases all those witnesses actually have knowledge that, put together, crafts a narrative that can be used to convict.This is not that at all. They are worried they can't win the presidential election because all their candidates are terrible. So they are doubling down on what they have been doing this entire time with Trump or people they perceive as threats like Kavanaugh, and they are using people to bring forth unsubstantiated claims that can't be proven or disproven because there isn't enough evidence at all. Then they make a public spectacle about it to convince people such as yourself that there actually is something of substance there when there is not.They keep ensuring that this is public by having their people leak information or fail to follow proper protocol. Schiff had tons of contact with the leaker before the leak, the congresswoman who was in contact with Blasey-Ford didn't send the accusation through to the proper people and instead leaked it to the news because they wanted the public to suspect Kavanaugh, they didn't care about the truth.Keep your false narratives out of our sub. I think it's hilarious how you think this is good for the discourse. I love how you think these sites are unique to republicans. > the ambassadors called thus far have provided more firsthand information than the whistleblower likely could.You mean the ambassador who was canned before this whole thing happened? Well yeah, but I mean how far do you think the tariffs or other economic actions should go, meaning how intensely should they be applied? What specifically do you want to see? How far do you want this to go at this point? That's the question because we are both in agreement that things need to be done but what is reasonable. China wields a lot of power, we have to be careful. Ok, then how about not fucking things over for the rest of us? Yep. Let's not disparage the police and make them out to be homophobes based on behavior we don't understand (speaking about the OP not you). Scared off? You rambled away from the point. This is a bunch of poorly crafted red herons. Dude, you make a decent point, but you put it in the shittiest way possible. This is not the way to win people over. Shit, I commented under the wrong comment. Please ignore that comment and accept my apologies. Will delete. Not exactly. According to article III section III of the constitution:Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.We are not necessarily at war with all our enemies. This is articulated elsewhere in our law a bit more carefully than I stated it.So you can commit treason even if we aren't officially at war with anyone. Because that is stupid. Please don't be trashy. Or they are benefiting from things that have nothing to do with their politics. IN the 1850's the state basically started it's existence due to the California Gold Rush, so it began it's existence simply because there was money lying around in the dirt. People also saw the great farm land and flocked out there for that.As the 1900's rolled in another MASSIVE cultural change happened. Edison basically monopolized film making tech on the east coast, so filmmaker types flocked to Cali because there were awesome natural formations for filming and because word would travel about Edison's people coming to sue them and they could just flee. Once the market opened up and some competition happened, Hollywood's film industry was established. Relations with Asian countries along with Asians fleeing to the US in the 1800s and onward meant there was a lot of cheap labor to build up the railroads, which built up the economy. There are some great natural ports in California as well.As film became bigger and bigger, Hollywood film making was poised to boom, and with the weather, the wide open spaces, the fantastic landscapes, the industry there boomed. With it came beautiful actresses, handsome actors, and the cultural boom that comes with celebrity and artists flocking to a new place.After about 100 years of the film industry unofficial capitol being Hollywood California, and with the connection of the infrastructure between the east and west, with all the ports, natural resources, and so on, California establish itself as one of the biggest economies in the world with its own propaganda machine.Like New York, Los Angeles is a massive piggy bank for the state that has allowed it to thrive even despite the idiotic, wasteful, and dangerous legislation that drives average people out.So when people see their success and say "They must be doing something right..." they are ignoring all the stuff the government didn't do at all to make California what it is today.California and New York are sort of like the "socialist" countries in the EU that socialists constantly refer to as socialist success stories. Those EU countries are propped up by the US and our military defense of them among other things. So they have a massive need taken care of without needing to pay for it. New York and California have these massive piggy banks they can draw from due to cultural significance. For decades people have dreamed of moving to NYC or LA to seek out stardom or to just be around these massive cultural centers. These things have almost nothing to do with the government... I say "almost" because New York and Cali see the benefit of having these massive cultural centers in their states. So while they tax their people into oblivion, they tend to also try to keep those regulations from touching the film and TV industries.Why do you think porn is so easily accessible to kids? We could easily pass a common sense law that requires porn companies to have customers and visitors prove their age... we could even just require a credit card, which would drastically reduce the amount of porn accessed by underage users. That is a billion dollar industry that would take a massive hit because many users are underage.So California would protect those industries because they are based in their state and add to the massive cultural appeal of the state which brings people from all over the country there, but they will pass regulation for their state that hurts industries not based in their state. Their car regulations hurt the car industry that is based in other states. So they hurt the industries in other states, which makes California seem all that more appealing. What? There is a whole spectrum of positions between military world dominance and complete isolationism. Your comment is just as much bullshit as the shakedown narrative. Or it is a mutually beneficial relationship, but Japan has gotten it for free for a long time.The mafia-like scam is not even close to valid. Japan raped and killed millions. We sacrificed many of our own to stop them and liberate the people they took over. The world did not want them having a military for a while so we helped them rebuild, and we literally protected them from actual enemies, including a growing threat from China. It was not some shake down of some poor business owner.Considering Japan has one of the strongest economies in the world after we provided all that security, it stands to reason that they now help pay for the protection we give them.This shakedown narrative is utter bullshit. Except in this case the protection was needed from actual enemies and because Japan, you know, raped and killed millions of people so we kinda didn't want them to have a military for a while.EDIT: so recent history doesn't matter if it hurts your narrative hating on Trump, gotcha. This is true, but we also can't just jump headfirst into something, as honorable as it may be. The democrats will never be as hard on China and if Trunp lets the tariffs hurt people who have not been convinced of our need to make some serious sacrifices to stop China, then Trump will lose and all progress will be lost.Unfortunately domestic politics affect these things, in this case because we can't trust the dems to do what we need them to do on this. If Trump pushes too hard, the narrative will be that he doesn't care who he hurts and they will find some minor thing he said or did in the process that will lead all the Trump haters (the media included) to cast severe doubt on what Trump is doing in China. There will probably be some kind of leak again that comes out just after the economic effects start to suck for the average person a little. This would foment anger against Trump and everything he would be doing.If the Democrats weren't so hell bent on destroying him and the Republican party, the moves the Repuplicans make could be a bit bolder. If I could save a man from a murderer but didn't know my family would survive without me, it isn't really honorable for me to sacrfice myself for the man. I can try to talk the murderer out of it, maybe try and stop him in a safer, less direct way, but just straight up sacrificing myself wouldn't be smart. So she is a holiday specific escort. You know, when I think corruption I don't really think about the manager at a video game store winning the sales competition with the same store at the other mall. I said these were the perceptions on thr people involved, not reality. I disagree with your assessment, but that is not the point. We are talking intentions. Of defense? You read way too far into what I was saying. And then all this happened. Your point was obvious. Don't deny it. Stand by it. No shit. Stop acting like people are idiots when they don't agree with your view. No, the argument is whether it was illegal or not. You have a twisted way of thinking about my intent. You are the one arguing in bad faith.Take care. So teens should be able to talk to predators in their 40s? We shouldn't protect them from that? You are assuming the intent behind the release of the money. I just assume the people that buy the fancy shit are idiots who spend money on stupid things. It helps a lot. I find it interesting the user's answer to your question here did not answer uour question and does what the GOP is being blamed for in his very comment: distraction.The whole argument is whether Trump asked for this quid pro quo for the express and solitary reason of getting a political rival. Quid pro quos happen all the time in politics, and usually they are not illegal. "We will eliminate the sanctions against you if you stop doing X" this happens constantly with no issues. These are quid pro quos.The sole factor is whether this quid pro quo was specifically to get Biden out of the race. Biden had been losing support to Warren and others since just after his announcement. So it doesn't make sense that he'd be worried about him. A concern for general corruption though is valid, there is even an international treaty from 2002 or so with over 160 signatories (The US and Ukraine included) wherein the signatories promised to investigate corruption for each other. So asking the Ukraine to investigate corruption is like asking someone to take out the trash when they already promised they would.Further, if there is valid reason a political opponent is corrupt, we should still investigate it. If there is no evidence and we investigate then we are violating the spirit of due process. This is not intended to distract from the presidents it is merely an example of an example that is bad: but when Obama investigated Trump prior to the election without substantial evidence of anything, that was a dangerous abuse of the office (unless there were substantial claims against him). So far the only substantial claims against Trump that the public knows of is the infamous Steele Dossier which was cooked up (and leaked before it was vetted by the way).Anyway, none of this smacks of Trump using the power of his office in an abusive way. It sounds like he gave the money to them without even getting what he mentioned that he thought they should look at. All of it smacks off  Schiff cooking something up to get Trump.That said, if Trump really did something illegal and they can prove it, I'm all for booting him out of office. But right now this looks like a massive political stunt just like Kavanaugh. I imagine it is less effective as well. But obviously much easier on the surrounding soil. Access in that sense is important too. So, many apps that seem innocent can have a lot of crap in them that are not good for young people and add to the mental health problem. A lot of parents hear their kids are making videos on YouTube and think nothing of it, but there is some creepy stuff that happens there, not that long ago there was a huge post here about pedophiles liking and commenting on kids' videos. Snapchat was originally designed for a sexting app, and teens still use it as such from time to time. I mean just look at reddit, it seems innocent enough, but people get nasty on here and a significant number of subs are porn subs.The only access that perhaps doesn't matter is the kind of hardware the kids have access to, but the software for that hardware can be harder to discern any issue with. Umm, what? A coup? What the hell are you talking about? This isn't whataboutism, this is simply pointing out some of the catty crap that has happened. Whataboutism is really just the red herring fallacy. All I'm doing is saying this isn't new for either party. I'm so sorry you didn't like the example I chose, there are many others. And im pretty sure civility is a rule here. I think this is the right move, too. But could we maybe not wish ill on her? I would hope she* repents and learns why she was wrong and then maybe speaks out against Muslim extremists and affects some kind of change. I know that's hoping a lot, but I prefer that to hoping she rots. I mean she is a mother, too.She should absolutely not be let back in, she made her bed and she must lie in it... but again, let's not wish her harm. I'm not ignoring them. Everyone knows them, I am providing the counter points because everyone knows those points. Please don't not assume bad intentions.Don't you think it is reasonable to think that someone who wants to commit suicide would wait until they are taken off suicide watch to do it? It would be far easier then. I mean that's the point of suicide watch, to prevent suicide, the HOPE is for them not to commit suicide. He easily could have just pretended he wasn't a threat to himself and then they let him off suicide watch.>Even if he did actually kill himself (very unlikely), there was gross incompetence and negligence on the behalf of the prison. The lack of video surveillance itself should be grounds for dismissal or everybody involved.Ok, but how does this have anything to do with proving he killed himself. Gross negligence is common in prisons.... hell, it's common everywhere. Below is a collection of articles and points I made in another thread. When you look at all the details it makes suicide seem far more reasonable.[Here is an article](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-jul-05-la-me-jail-bedding-20100705-story.html) from 2010 that talks about how suicide bedding is ineffective.Suicide is impossible on suicide watch? Nope, even the bedding they use to try and prevent it doesn't seem to work.Not that the NYT is the most trustworthy, but [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/us/mississippi-private-prison-abuse.html) is an article from last year, before Epstein killed himself.From the article (as it is behind a paywall):>According to evidence and testimony at a federal civil rights trial, far worse things were happening at the prison than inmates strolling around during a lockdown: **A mentally ill man on suicide watch hanged himself**, gang members were allowed to beat other prisoners, and those whose cries for medical attention were ignored resorted to setting fires in their cells.Hmm... it sure sounds like prisons aren't run very well, are they? Even when it comes to suicide watch... again, this was 2018 when the article was written. But suicide is impossible, right?Now the article is talking about a private prison. State operated prisons though are not a whole lot better. [Here](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/2017-07-26/understaffed-and-overcrowded-state-prisons-crippled-by-budget-constraints-bad-leadership) is an article about state run prisons and how they are underfunded and under-staffed, which leads to bad situations, you know, like suicide.>In California, where corrections facilities were an average of 175 percent over capacity by the end of 2010, some prisoners slept in beds that were triple-bunked, **the inmate suicide rate was 80 percent higher than the national average**, and a lack of access to basic health care led to an average of one unnecessary death every week, according to a report from the Marshall Project, a nonprofit that investigates criminal justice failures.Alright, that's Cali. But [here's an article about New York closing two prisons](https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/politics/albany/2019/03/29/new-york-close-two-prisons-part-state-budget-but-where/3309798002/). Where do you think those prisoners go? How well do you think they are being guarded?Ok, those are state prisons. [Here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/13/ill-equipped-and-inexperienced-hundreds-civilian-staffers-assigned-guard-duties-federal-prison-secur/316616002/) is one about FEDERAL prisons being understaffed.[Here's](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/08/22/federal-prison-suicides-rising-before-jeffrey-epsteins-death/2070689001/) an article talking about how the suicide rates have been rising since before Epstein... maybe these suicide watches have never been very good.When you think about how underfunded and understaffed so many prisons are, you begin to see that perhaps a camera malfunction is not that insane to believe. In fact, I imagine incompetent employees would say "yeah the camera just stopped working" instead of admitting that the cameras haven't been working for months, they just haven't gotten them fixed. Why? I might be inclined to believe you if you could explain why 5K gums up the works. You say it "feels like" 10K would be a good compromise. And I'm with ya, I could see that, but frankly I don't know why. 5K might be more than reasonable. But it seems both of us just "feel" this way rather than knowing what actually is reasonable. This is part of the problem. This could be absolutely reasonable but the public doesn't know. The dems could be making a stink just because they know no one knows whether this is unreasonable or not and so they jump on it do try to score some political capital or because they actually do want to spend far more than they should. Much ado about nothing works when people don't know. Considering you don't know, I don't know why you know you or anyone here can be mad about this. This seems to be an important question.>If the Republicans were interested in shared power, then they would be attempting to find points of compromise to get a few Democrats onboard rather than trying to push this through on a simple party line vote.What if the Democrats have shown no willingness to get along? That's one of the things that happens on the national stage, Trump offered amnesty and to extent DACA if the Dems would pay for a measly border wall. They refused. Time after time Republicans would vote in a justice with leftist leanings, but the dems stonewalled any conservative one until finally the republicans stood up to them when the Garland Gorsuch thing was going on. When you look at the history, the Democrats have brought so many bogus charges against conservative nominees, that it's basically expected now. They successfully got Bork out of the running back in the 80's based on nothing, but even then that wasn't the beginning.What I keep finding is that Democrats keep getting a pass on all this behavior with the public but when the Republicans finally stand up to it, it's like "Whoa hey, we gotta badass over here" and everyone gets mad at them. This is true in the media, too. Republicans have been bashed incessantly for decades, when we dish it back suddenly everyone flips out. So I tend to think that most democrats literally don't know how bad their party is, while republicans are forced to look at all this stuff because all media talks about it. We can't avoid it. The public can name all the Trump scandals, but they can't name a single Obama scandal and Fast and Furious was a big one, his hot mic comment to the Russian leader about having more leniency after the election was a huge one, too... but no one cared and no one on mainstream of left leaning media covered it.Anyway, my point is not to complain about that. But simply to point out that this is not one sided. Based on what I've seen, I think a lot of democrats would be surprised to hear their own history because they've only ever heard the bad Republican stuff, and I mean some of the democrat behavior has been disgusting, it just never gets the air time or the clicks.Based on what I have seen on a state level and nationally, Republicans largely have tried to share power but keep getting backed into a corner by dishonest tactics. I mean look at Adam Schiff... his star witness was some lowly aid who literally only had 4th hand hearsay. He heard someone, who said he heard someone, who said he heard someone, who said he heard Trump. Schiff has been on the air for months saying he has damning evidence, and this was it.Anyway, I don't think it's really fair or reasonable for the vitriol that is being put against the GOP when people don't even know if this is reasonable or not.There are tons of times I've done something that looks like I'm taking advantage but it just happened. You know? Like I can't help it if I happen to be by the kitchen the moment the cookies come out of the oven and I get first pick... but it sure seemed to my sister that I was trying to get a jump on her. Should I not hang out by the kitchen when anything is being cooked? Or should I trust that people won't just jump to a conclusion that I'm an asshole just because I got the best cookie? >stop giving kids so much access to technologyWhat part of this is not about moderation? If you moderate how much time is spent, you are limiting the access.Thank you for the correction on the age range, though! I've heard many different ranges so I don't know what to believe anymore. Why would you pass it if you're not concerned about the people in power at the moment doing it? I'm not saying it's right, but the motive makes sense.If you are the one doing the shopping for your house and you always by stuff on sale, you always buy off brand stuff, and you are careful about your spending (I don't mean to say at all that the local GOP is like this, I'm just making a point), you aren't going to put some kind of spending limit on your account. But then your spouse takes over the responsibility because you have other things you need to do. You know your spouse spends too much (and I'm not saying this is necessarily accurate, but the perception) and buys only name brand stuff, never uses coupons, and loves to buy stuff the family doesn't need... why would you put the spending limit on while you have the responsibility? There is no reason to. You would only do it when you know your spouse is going to be taking care of the shopping from now on. For them I suppose. This is good for us and for the world though. Some might consider this trolling. I would stop. Ok... thank you for miscategorizing what I said and how I said it. This is dishonest.So I won't answer you. Take care. Forgive me, I don't have a TL;DR. You raised a really interesting question and I wanted to answer it as fully as I could.>Why must the young be misguided rather than differently guided?This is an awesome question, it shows a really deep understanding, but it also kind of misses the mark in another way. It is not that they are *misguided*, per se (though I think an alarming number these days are misguided), it is that they are *unguided*. In other words, they come out of high school with still undeveloped brains packed with very basic knowledge and skill, then they go to college and hear a new side of the story, and the new side of the story seems more intelligible and cool. Part of that is simply because your brain is a little more developed than it was in high school, so you pick up on more nuance to arguments, you start understanding a bit more complexity in how things work. The problem is, students at this age are largely unaware of how little they really know.This is a fact of life that no young person tends to believe, I sure didn't. And yet it is as true as women being the most confusing puzzle man has ever encountered. We know this fact of youth is true experientially. Most young adults figure this out pretty quick... usually when you think you're hot shit and then get your first job and find out your boss doesn't care how talented a singer you are, he just wants you to get the report in on time. But they often miss other things, things they might not see simply because they haven't started paying their own way through life yet. Like that taxes suck and that it sucks when taxes go up, and it especially sucks when taxes go up to pay for things that a lot of people who don't even try to work receive.>why do you assume their passion leads them astray ?Passion is one of the most beautiful things about youth. They have more passion than older people in many ways. And that passion does some wonderful things... it leads to curiosity about why bad things happen, it leads to a lot of question about why we do things as we do. It also leads to challenging older people on those traditions and behaviors they have been practicing.We ought to test all things, we ought to question all things. If something is good, it ought to stand up to scrutiny, right? And young people scrutinize everything as they learn about it, this helps make sure the older people have a good reason for their stance, and often times the youth help the older people refine their stances and make them even better. We saw this during the civil rights movement, the older generations had lived within a fantastic system of government, but it was applied very poorly because it was not applied as it was intended. So the youth tested that through protest and discussion. What happened? We refined our nation and made it even better (not that it is perfect). So when the scrutiny is reasonable and healthy it is amazing what it does.But what if that scrutiny is not reasonable? What if the people scrutinizing are swayed a lot more by passion than by reason? What if the people who are scrutinizing don't yet know enough about the world to see why their passions are incorrect? Sometimes you don't need to know much about the world to know why something is wrong. Sometimes you might think something is wrong, but in reality it's fine, you just didn't know all the reasons why it is fine.We see this a lot today with the hatred we see for corporations. People have this idea that corporations are just evil and that all billionaires are dishonest, getting their wealth either through deceit. Except then you look at someone like Bill Gates, he was a middle class dude, started a company in his garage, and then made his billions. He didn't deceive anyone... he simply provided a product people loved. Same with the Starbucks guy. Same with Jeff Bezos.Anyway, my point is that these people weren't just evil people, and their businesses didn't hurt anyone. in fact their companies provided goods and services that helped people AND they employed people to do it. Employment is quite helpful to people, I'm very glad I am employed.So we have very good reason NOT to believe that corporations are inherently evil. But the passion of much of the youth is dead set on this belief that all corporations are evil, and it is setting them down this road that we should do away with them and take their power... except who ends up getting that power? You? Me? The people? No, the government gets that power.Do all young people do this? No, but they are very susceptible to it. This is why Mao utilized the youth in the Communist revolution. He literally got them to kill teachers and smart people so they wouldn't spread reasonable ideas that went against the movement the youth were so passionate about. Now targeting the youth with ideas is not necessarily a bad thing. But when it is getting them to act crazy and unreasonable, usually it means that whoever is targeting them is doing so to incite something. So knowing something before you know it is considered smart now. It's not a bad faith argument, you just disagree. Bad Faith is one someone is being intentionally deceptive, this is not one of those times.Further, there are many reasons why you might not spend time on passing such a bill. Pretending as if there are none is rather narrow minded. Perhaps you don't feel your party is the one that is likely to overspend, in which case you wouldn't worry about it until it looks like the other is about to take power. If spending is as bad an issue as many conservatives and republicans believe it is, the dangers of letting it continue might outweigh their concerns about how they look. Do you think they were unaware of how they would look and how the media and the Democrats would spin this? Of course they knew, but they felt it was important enough to do it anyway. Whether they are right or not is a different question, the concern is their motive because the law itself isn't that bad and does a lot of good. Sometimes not doing something like this earlier is a valid point to bring up, in this case I think it's easily explainable. >Enacting this legislation after the election proves the GOP only cares about limits when they are not in power.Again, if you are confident in your party not overspending, why would you care about limits when you have control? For example, imagine you share a bank account with your spouse. You know that you are reasonable, you know what you can and can't afford, and you won't overspend. However, you know your spouse tends to overspend and has even gotten you into some hot water before with how much he or she spent. So you call the bank and set a limit to how much can be withdrawn or spent in a day. You could have done it earlier, but your spouse was busy with something and just wasn't going to spend much, but now you are busy with a new job or something you aren't home as much and your spouse is going to pick up the slack at home. You know your spouse will spend too much, so you set the limit so as not to bankrupt the family. I think the situation is as suspicious as anyone but when you look at the statistics and the details about prisons, it is not as crazy as it sounds to think it was a suicide.The bedding used in prison suicide watch rooms as late as 2011 was found to be ineffective.Funding problems have led to many people on suicide watch committing suicide as well as prisoners being able to walk around during lockdowns, riots, murders, and so on. These problems exist at state and federal levels. Considering that oversight is probably as lacking as anything else it's highly likely that sleeping on the job is frequent and easy to get away with. And given that budgets are so low, camera issues seem more than plausible.We have this idea that every prison is run like that special super hero prison from Avengers. When in truth they are run more like The Office, but set at a prison. These are not all incredibly well paying jobs, they are probably unionized but I'm not sure on that, and union jobs tend to invite a lot of laziness (depending on the union and type of job). There is a reason the sleeping prison guard is a trope we see all throughout story telling.So while the circumstances surrounding Epsteins death are certainly suspicious, I think it's more reasonable to assume it was a suicide with the current evidence we have. China has been investing in programs in colleges all over the world, many are in the US. This should be concerning to everyone and it was all slipped in under our noses. I wouldn't be surprised if they and/or Russia are targeting colleges to foment civil unrest or at the very least to propagandize to young people.One of the great things about young people is their passion and the ingenuity. One of the dangerous things about young people is how their passion can be steered in dangerous directions, because as smart as they often are, they have yet to really see how the world works as active members in it, so they often see injustice where there is not (not that they dont see real I justice too) and they often see apathy in older people when in truth the older people simply have different priorities or see things differently. This is why historically, the youth are always targeted by movements of all kinds, but particularly by the evil ones, because older people can naturally take a more dispassionate view, whereas younger people are more prone to passion blinding them or greatly skewing their views. This isn't new. Back just before Bush took office, the Clinton folks literally stole stuff from the White House and had to return it and the staffers were all told to remove the W key from all the key boards (and they did).Both parties are bad at this, and frankly the dems have done it longer, it's just gone under the radar for their base. Now they see the GOP do it and most don't realize that the Dems have been doing similar stuff for a long time.EDIT: typo and clarity. Forgive the length.Your last point isn't entirely invalid, but it is not a reason to dismiss the law, rather it is a reason to make sure the law is upheld (assuming you agree with what the law attempts to do, which is limit spending and avoid corruption). Rather than hate it for it's weakness, push that it be made permanent, regardless of who is in the office. That said, it is not wrong to have the cynical view you hold about the move.But another point, Democrats do tend to have more of a spending problem (not that the GOP is really doing a great job on this lately, at least at the national level). While I know it feels like a sort of attack on the new Dem, it can also be looked at as keeping a likely spender in check. We all agree that spending is a big concern, and I imagine we would all agree that there are things we don't spend on that we should and things we do spend on that we shouldn't, and I bet we agree a lot on much of what we should and shouldn't spend on. I think we agree on a lot more than we think but we get caught up in other things. I'm certain we all think we need more money for cops and more money for schools, and that that money should be spent well. But we often spend a lot on programs that feel good, sort of forgetting that we have higher priorities. For instance, spending on a place where heroin addicts can safely take heroin rather than spending on cops first seems odd to me because the space attempts to alleviate problems that more cops would also alleviate, and more cops would also alleviate a lot of other problems. We would get more bang for our buck with more cops, and yet we choose soemthing that may benefit the community to some degree, but not as much as adequate policing. This is one of the biggest criticisms of the Democrat party. The people know that Democrat voters have hearts, but they seem to pick goals that actually make the basics harder, they spend on nice ideas, but then have to cut spending elsewhere in places we could really use the money. Sometimes where we could really use the money is in the hands of the people, which means lower taxes can really help. Property taxes are really bad here, and it has an effect on how affordable living is here, the quality of life, and even the tax base. The higher the property taxes are the less people want to live here, and eventually the rate of people leaving will out pace the spending and we will have to deal with the spending in more drastic ways.So while I totally get why it feels like an attack and a rather underhanded one, it seems to be a valid means of keeping spending in check, as well as limiting nepotism and corruption. I would be more critical of the GOP if they did indeed remove these limits if and when another GOP member takes office, but you are blaming them for something they haven't done yet. We need to get spending under control, and the more we put it off, the more these kinds of strategies that seem really underhanded will become necessary to save us from ourselves. New York State's population growth is the worst in the nation despite our birthrate being about the same and despite people constantly moving to get a piece of New York City. Despite that, we lose a lot of people who are fleeing the taxes and the spending. An underhanded move like this actually makes us face that. And while I don't appreciate the tactic, and as cynical as we ought to be about it (because your concern isn't entirely invalid, it's simply premature), this move forces the government to check itself on spending. We need to take a harder look at the spending, we have to. It is killing our state slowly.I'm a Republican, but I'm an American first. I see parties as an unfortunate means to solve some problems, but that causes others. This is why I tend to look at them from a divorced perspective. The dems have done all kinds of underhanded stuff, so have the GOP. Frankly, I think the dems do it more but are also more successful in spinning the more underhanded moves they do as a positive in the eyes of the public. The GOP is abysmal at spinning what they do into a positive when it seems so underhanded, partly because the media is not on their side, but they also aren't as good with PR in general.I wish we all took that divorced view, but instead, and especially on here, we get rapt up in the political infighting and it blinds us to the bigger picture. Not that this is a good strategy, but regardless of the strategy we should look at the law and whether it is good or not. A good law is good regardless of the timing. So let's look at the law.1) it limits the ability for the County Executive to employ nepotism. This has long been a complaint in this sub. Thar would seem like a good thing.2) It limits corruption by forcing the CE to check in with the legislature more frequently (by reducing that spending threshold). The problem this addresses has also been a complaint of this sub.3) It gives more power to your local district legislator by reducing the power of the executive.[This article](https://www.nystateofpolitics.com/2019/11/monroe-county-gop-legislators-propose-limiting-authority-of-new-democratic-county-executive/) highlights those points of the bill.While it seems like a stunt of the GOP to tie the hands of the CE before a Dem takes over, none of these changes seem all that bad based on the criticisms this sub has had about politics in general. This bill fights many problems you all have complained about and it does it for any future CE, Rep or Dem.Lastly, political stunts like these are not at a limited to the GOP. The Dems have pulled these kinds of stunts many times. If they were for a good cause, fine, if not then it's an especially shitty move. And just to show this is not limited to the GOP, when Bush won, Clinton and his people literally stole stuff from the white house and removed every W from every keyboard. Look it up, it's true. That achieved literally nothing, at least this law seems to achieve something we all want. Lol when did Democrats enact it when they won? You mean like l those massive spending programs and laws they pass across the state and nation? That isn't reducing power, that is taking and wielding power.I'm not defending the local GOP here, though if you think this is underhanded while Adam Schiff's behavior on the national stage is completely on the up and up, then you have a skewed perspective.It's like the Democrats are the spend happy wives in a marriage, and when hubby has to step in to slow that spending down, the wife flips out.This bill, while timed poorly, limits the ability for county executives to employ nepotism in their offices, and it makes sure that the legislature is more frequently consulted on spending. I have seen this sub upset with nepotism many times and this addresses that. The source is that academia, particular that of educators is almost entirely leftist. The hero of modern education, Dewey, was a failed teacher and a believer in socialism. That's not to say he didnt have some decent ideas, but they were very social justice oriented.Virtually all educational thought comes from this side of political thought.Many policies that came out of the civil rights movement were hijacked by leftists and imposed more rules on schools that ended up doing more damage than they solved.Much of the funding and education policy enacted by Bill Clinton added to this problem.Bush (obviously not a democrat) passed the No Child Left Behind act which didn't help at all. But this was informed by those leftist academics in education.One of the biggest issues was the push to make people career ready and competitive in the global market. This was a relatively bipartisan drive that helped pushed civics (mobile typo) out of the classroom more. This was actually a step away from what conservatives and the right believe which is teaching critical thinking skills and what our country is built upon. This was a failure of our diligence and an opportunity for the left to get what it wants.If the right is guilty in some of this decline, it is in trusting leftist academics that virtually control all the thought on this. I will defer to the commenters who soundly critiqued your point.But I would add that these federal policies reach every state. They have made the standards worse by attempting to make them better. High performing Democrat strongholds may only be high performing *inspite* of these policies, not *because* of them. But again, the data you presented is faulty at best.In other words, if I impose a shit policy on everyone in something, like say I make it mandatory that all football players tie one hand behind their backs, all of them will suck more but some will suck less than others. This isnt a good measure of the quality of the game at because they just drastically changed it. They got rid of civics classes. That wasn't us. Now the citizenry doesn't know what a right is. There are a thousand small things. It's a nice sentiment, though not a perfect one. I didnt imply they aren't working hard. I'm implying that the bad trends among them are often self inflicted. Not all, but many. And many aren't working hard.EDIT: also, Im being ridiculous? Saving 2000 by not buying lunches out all the time is not insignificant at all. You ignored that part and said I only talk about subscriptions. Millenials buy tons of stuff they don't need. A lot of that stuff adds up. This is ridiculous. Boomers worked to get to the point to afford those things. Most boomers I know drove a clunker for many years until they could afford new cars. Most boomers, if they spent money on coffee, bought just a black coffee for $.50 instead of a $5.35 latte.The boomers I know pinched pennies and did all kinds of things to make ends meet that none of the millennial do. No one changes their oil anymore, no one does basic car maintenance. Cars are a little trickier now, but when millennials were just becoming young adults, they didn't repair the clunkers they had, they never took the time to learn. I just learned how to change my break pads and I saved $200. I learned how to change a warn serpentine belt and I saved another $50. Millenials don't do that anymore. They are buying all kinds of stuff they don't need at all and then they look around and are like "where is all my money going?! I'm only paying for the essentials?!?!"The essentials? Like a $1000 iphone? How many of them are going to sign up for Disney+ when they have Netflix and Amazon and X-Box Live? Essentials...I mean if you spend $60 a week on just food or coffee to get through the week, that becomes $3000 over the course of a year. $3000!!You could make good, healthy lunches for the work week for $20 if you bring them. You end up saving $2000 by doing so. Toss that into retirement, put it towards your bills, whatever. Suddenly you aren't sinking, you are thriving. Cut your Netflix, suddenly you save another $150.You are acting as if Boomers didn't work hard an earn that stuff. My father drove beat up used cars until he was 45. My parents bought a minivan new for my mom when they were maybe 40.All of your reasons here are bad excuses. You talk essentials and yet that article is pointing to millennials buy unessentials. Obviously if you need internet and a phone to work, you need to get that. But stop buying coffee, bring a thermos from home. Stop buying lunches, bring a sandwich from home.It's not that hard. Why?Could it be that they aren't being responsible? I am part of the generation in question here, by the way. I have had to make a ton of adjustments.https://www.thesimpledollar.com/millions-of-millennials-spend-more-on-coffee-and-other-things-than-retirement/If you are spending more on coffee and eating out than you should, it might be your own fault as to why you don't have a home or are not saving for retirement.Yes, the economy is weird right now, but there were also a ton of dumb decisions about majors and loans. That is not the economy's fault, that is the fault of people making stupid decisions. This isn't true for several reasons. You say this as if the financial situations are not their fault, certainly there are some strange economics going on lately, but [here is an article](https://www.thesimpledollar.com/millions-of-millennials-spend-more-on-coffee-and-other-things-than-retirement/) about how millenials are not saving for retirement and instead are buy coffee, are eating out, are spending at the gym. In short, they are not budgeting like previous generations. Might not having a retirement plan be adding to the stress? So this money issue is largely their own fault (and I am in this group).Then you look at the tech and the results of the tech on the discourse in this country. People are lonelier than ever. Economic woes are a small aspect of this, it's not like we're living in the Great Depression. A lot of people made bad decisions and took out too many loans, and that sucks and surely contributes to mental health issues, but we also inundate ourselves with tech constantly, it is never off.[Here is a study](https://aspeneducation.crchealth.com/article-teen-sleeping/) that shows how little sleep teens are getting. The culprit? Technology. And it is well established that sleep deprivation has a very negative effect on mental health. This trend is hitting adults, too. Tech.The technology we have has inundated us with things that distract us from things that actually make us productive in life. The amount of time wasted is astonishing, time that could be spent doing productive things or just working, maybe getting in a few more hours, or just using those 2.5 hours of wasted time on social media on meals for the week, clipping coupons, tutoring for a little extra cash, etc. Where did I get this 2.5 hours stat? [From here](https://techjury.net/blog/time-spent-on-social-media/#gref). So because you didn't make your lunch and because you are so tired, you sleep in as long as you can, forcing yourself to rush in the morning when you can barely think about lunch, so you buy a lunch instead of bringing one, you buy coffee instead of making some. If you buy lunch and coffee every day, let's say that is about $15 total for the day, $75 for the week, that is $3750 over 50 weeks (let's assume you don't work two weeks of the year). That is a substantial sum of money that is not going into savings. Why? I won't blame it entirely on technology, but if you remove 2.5 hours our of your waking day, it sure feels like you don't have enough time in the day to do what you should.Even teens are worried about the amount of time they spend on smart phones:https://qz.com/1367506/pew-research-teens-worried-they-spend-too-much-time-on-phones/Think about all the social pitfalls there are, the little spats you had with your friends, the nasty thing you heard Sandra say about you... now put that in your pocket and let it buzz you... instead of ignoring Sandra and forgetting about her, you see her on your Snapchat, Facebook, and Twitter feeds.  Or you see your best friend doing a TikTok with her, and suddenly you worry you don't have any friends. The same pitfalls exist with and without technology, but with technology, it lives in us far longer. Think about how unproductive someone is who is worried about losing all their friends, or who feels the need to constantly check their phones. Yeah, taking breaks from homework is important, but students are more likely to take breaks from their social media to do homework than to focus on the homework itself.People would like to blame the circumstances, but there are a lot of bad behaviors causing this. And here's the thing, the older generation didn't protect the younger generation from it. There is some reason to be upset with the older generation, but that doesn't mean we can blame all our problems on them or the current economic climate, we have to take responsibility.EDIT: Whoever downvoted, downvote all you want, it's the truth. Fair point, I misspoke. But it's the same problem. Not enough real time with people, too much tech. Cell phones, too much computer time, not enough exercise, and lax parenting.This is easily fixable if parents put their collective foot down and stop giving kids so much access to technology. Are you conservative? You seem more like a concern troll.While it is possible he was murdered and on the surface the circumstances surrounding his death seem suspicious, when you look at some facts about prisons, it starts looking a bit more like a suicide.[Here is an article](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-jul-05-la-me-jail-bedding-20100705-story.html) from 2010 that talks about how suicide bedding is ineffective.Suicide is impossible on suicide watch? Nope, even the bedding they use to try and prevent it doesn't seem to work.Not that the NYT is the most trustworthy, but [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/us/mississippi-private-prison-abuse.html) is an article from last year, before Epstein killed himself.From the article (as it is behind a paywall):>According to evidence and testimony at a federal civil rights trial, far worse things were happening at the prison than inmates strolling around during a lockdown: **A mentally ill man on suicide watch hanged himself**, gang members were allowed to beat other prisoners, and those whose cries for medical attention were ignored resorted to setting fires in their cells.Hmm... it sure sounds like prisons aren't run very well, are they? Even when it comes to suicide watch... again, this was 2018 when the article was written. But suicide is impossible, right?Now the article is talking about a private prison. State operated prisons though are not a whole lot better. [Here](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/2017-07-26/understaffed-and-overcrowded-state-prisons-crippled-by-budget-constraints-bad-leadership) is an article about state run prisons and how they are underfunded and under-staffed, which leads to bad situations, you know, like suicide.>In California, where corrections facilities were an average of 175 percent over capacity by the end of 2010, some prisoners slept in beds that were triple-bunked, **the inmate suicide rate was 80 percent higher than the national average**, and a lack of access to basic health care led to an average of one unnecessary death every week, according to a report from the Marshall Project, a nonprofit that investigates criminal justice failures.Alright, that's Cali. But [here's an article about New York closing two prisons](https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/politics/albany/2019/03/29/new-york-close-two-prisons-part-state-budget-but-where/3309798002/). Where do you think those prisoners go? How well do you think they are being guarded?Ok, those are state prisons. [Here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/13/ill-equipped-and-inexperienced-hundreds-civilian-staffers-assigned-guard-duties-federal-prison-secur/316616002/) is one about FEDERAL prisons being understaffed.[Here's](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/08/22/federal-prison-suicides-rising-before-jeffrey-epsteins-death/2070689001/) an article talking about how the suicide rates have been rising since before Epstein... maybe these suicide watches have never been very good.When you think about how underfunded and understaffed so many prisons are, you begin to see that perhaps a camera malfunction is not that insane to believe. First, how dare you act as if I don't have compassion. I have worked in the inner cities to help children in broken homes with their school work and ended up just helping them cope with their lives. There were tons of children there I would have liked to help but I couldn't because there are only so many hours in the day, because I have a life I need to provide for, and because rules were in place that prevented my action. Sometimes we can't help people, we have no right to go in and take that child from that mother. The mother acted incredibly foolishly and literally disavowed the US and became an enemy of us. But it is still her child, if she wants to give it up for adoptio, she can.... but she has no right to come back here when we have no way to know she is sincere or being used in some kind of plot. So stop making the people who disagree with you out to be soulless monsters with no compassion.Further... a technicality? There are somewhere around a billion children who could probably use some help in the world. Most of them have us much connection to the US as this child, which is none. This child has no birthright citizenship just like any son of Osama Bin Laden. Why? Because the parents are not citizens.There are millions of children who are not citizens of this country who we could help, you seem to only want to help this one because you know the individual story. There are far worse stories out there, we can't help everyone.This child was born of a defector from America, not just someone who went abroad for a few years, not just someone who became a dual citizen. This woman disavowed the country, went to be a terrorist (an enemy of the country), then had a baby with terrorists, and now is regretting her decision... or at least that is what she is saying. She has the same status as anyone else who is not a citizen of the United States, including her child.As I said, I would help all the children of the world if it was in my power to do so, even this one. But I have no right to take this child from his or her mother and even if she wanted us to, we shouldn't. Not because we are heartless towards this one child (we are not) but because we have a heart for all those children who need our help here, in our own country, whose parents struggle and need support as they try to make an honest life in a country they respect. This mother ruined her child's life and you are acting as if we are the bad ones. There is a lot of shit slinging especially on political talk-radio. I would strongly suggest listening to Ben Shapiro's podcast, he will sling a little shit but explains his points and why he is slinging that shit well.... so it's not so much shitslinging as it is a reasoned argument with some color. He also will explain law, he will look at opposing views and will say when he doesn't know something. He is not always right but will always provide solid reasoning for his claims. He can also talk really fast and I think his impressions kinda suck, but I still love the guy.Anyway, there is a ton to think about when it comes to politics. The history is extensive, complicated, and debates. So I would start first with learning the constitution and why it exists along with why our government exists in the form it does. Look at all the ways we have balanced powers, from the states vs the federal government, to the various parts of the federal government. And then consider if you think the threat of tyranny still exists and how that threat exists.The various news that pops up will make more and more sense as you go, so don't get bogged down in it at first, but use it as a basis for study if you are curious about something. Like when Kavanaugh was going through hell to be appointed the new Justice, I took it as an opportunity to learn a ton about the history of the courts and the politics that have come into the appointing of new justices.So take you time, know when you don't know something, and then take time to learn about that. So what you shared is known as an opinion that has little to no merit. You say he doesn't care and yet he takes time to visit first responders, nurses, veterans... he goes out to the people and weathers the hatred people like you spew at him. That certainly sounds like he cares. He has sacrificed wealth to do this, he's obviously still wealthy but he's one of few presidents whose wealth has decreased as a president rather than increased. That sure sounds like he cares. He frequently goes to see his constituents and supporters. These are just a few bits of evidence that shows he cares, you have to prove these actions are not what they seem and then give valid reasons why he doesnt care to prove anything.But you argue dishonestly, so I don't really care to hear your point. They're not conservatives. But even if I'm wrong on that, the point remains. I care about all children. We can't help them all. If you think we should then you should go save them all. The area moves off his in worse situations, I dont see you talking about them, gee, do you not care? That's so cold.Don't act like the people you disagree with are monsters. That's shitty, dishonest arguing.We can't help everyone. You need to argue honestly instead of making your opponent out to be someone who hasn't read anything. You act like the Kochs are the only powerful donors but fail to mention Soros a lefty who works billions on campaigns all last the country and helps fund people that help those caravans of immigrants to come to the border. The point is that these mega donors kinda balance out because the are those on the right and the left. But you present the issue as if only one side has these kinds of issues and then create a false narrative that everything is corrupt and run by corporations.You are overly cynical, and I say that as someone who is much more cynical than most.EDIT: btw, because of your dishonest, ad hominem laced arguing, I will not continue with you.  Take care. Vote for people who wish to maintain a balance of powers and who try to give power to the people, rather than those who make promises if only people give up some of their rights and choices.I lean conservative but not because I wish to be part of a team, so I dont say this to just crap on the left, but that side is the one that tends to push for massive federal programs that control industries like health care, they want to reduce gun rights, they want to federalize many things, and they are pushing anti-free-speech laws. They do all of this in the name of good, but all of these things take power away from the people or the states. It seems like we give up very little for what they want, but each time we take less power and the federal government takes more. I have no doubt people who support the left are hoping to do good things. But they are ending up making us weaker to bad regimes like China and setting us up to a greater risk of some kind of takeover here, though I imagine that would be far off if it were to happen. The person or group that takes power could be socialist/communist or it could be fascist but the change the left wants is opening us up to that more and more.We live on a slippery slope, if we aren't careful and we don't maintain our rights, we will lose them all, however little we seem to be giving up at any one time. What we have in this country is an outlier historically speaking. I really don't mean this to be an attack on the people on the left. I often use rhetoric that isn't kind to them. But I also don't want to soften my point here because the concern is legitimate. She is not an American citizen, neither is her child. This is entirely her fault. While I feel awful for the child, we can't allow this kind of behavior. She was given the gift of being a guest here and she spat in our faces and had a child with a terrorist. If she wants to give it up for adoption, I'm sure someone would adopt it in a country that doesn't suck. Please show me how any corporation is more powerful tha our government. The people do. While there is certainly interference from powerful people and lobbyists, our country is still ours. The idea that everything is controlled by elites is a bit overly cynical.However, we're at a point where things are getting closer to the world Justin Roiland thinks we're aleady in.This is why state's rights are really important. You may not like what every state is doing, but when the central government has all the power, then there is little left to stop a despotic leader or a corporate oligarchy of sorts. The more that power is consolidated to the federal government, the more corporations can control. By separating powers we reduce the chances that corporations or other bad actors can take control.By the way, limiting income is not a good way to do this. People will just take their money else where. Also the 90s were fun. We just got the internet and were distracted by chatrooms and porn everywhere for the first time. Yep, they're leftists. Which is fine but people think they (edit: they being the elites) are all Republican or something. The truth is that the current elites are on the left. Warren is worth a ton. The people who own Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Disney, NBC Universal, etc, they are all on the left. So when they think corporations own America, which they don't, but when they think that they wrongly apply that to right. Go ahead, down vote and tell me I'm a nazi. Except the whistleblower had nothing but like 4th hand here-say. If there is some real evidence out there, fine.Just a friendly warning though, if you guys aren't okay with what Trump purportedly has done but you are okay with Dem presidential candidates threatening to withhold aid unless they change their practices as they relate to the environment, then you are hypocrites. And by the way, the candidates are already threatening that quid pro quo. The way to stop this is a gradual tapering off. I'm going to speak to teaching because that is a piece of this pension puzzle I know a bit more about.> Then the state won't be able to afford to pay these pensions at all. This is not quite true, though it is also not wrong.The way we all talk about it, it feels like there is some kind of tipping point where the coffer runs dry and everything is just over. If nothing is done, we will empty the coffer but the states will just borrow from another coffer to make up the difference. Same thing with social security. Things will not just end when we hit the bottom of that massive pit of money because we will pull in more money soon after. It's basically like we spent our entire pay check before the next one came in, how do we survive until that next one? We might pull from our savings or cut some costs so that we aren't tapped so quickly after the next pay check, but the pay check is still coming.So to your point, the coffers will run dry at some point, but money will continue to come in, we will just be behind our bills rather than in front of them. This is not a good thing at all, I just make this point because I don't want people to think it's all doom and gloom... we can stay ahead of our bills.Gradual changes now can help a ton. Tapering off from the current pension funds and instead offering to simply pay teachers more and then help them invest their extra money rather than constantly borrowing from the teacher pension fund will 1) give teachers more flexibility and control over their spending (with modern investment companies, it is super easy), and 2) it will force states to spend more wisely because that massive pile of pension money (or social security if we talk about that) can't be borrowed from because it wouldn't really exist.The number 1 effect will lead to more taxable income for the government, but it will be contingent upon growth of that money... so we won't be able to fund these massive projects the democrats always want to fund, politicians will need to maintain a strong market if they want to spend the money. We never should have created this seemingly bottomless pool of money, because it has a bottom and makes it very tempting to spend on things we shouldn't.So we could do this, but we would have to look maybe 4 or 5 years down the line. Going into teaching is not a small decision, it is a big one, and one of the big factors people choose it is the benefits. We don't want to destabilize the entire education system instantly, but if we start reducing pension benefits while perhaps giving specific tax breaks to allow teachers to invest more of their earned income to make up the difference slowly over a few years, things would work very nicely. So teachers starting their careers will not be promised quite as much of a pension but are given tax breaks.The thing that kind of sucks right now is that New York is already sort of doing this, they are reducing pensions for the new teachers, but they are not doing much to help offset that.So it can be done, but it needs to be done gradually and we need to stick with it. The problem is, we also either need conservatives more in control of the government at both the state and federal levels, or we have a shitload of convincing to do. I don't know which is harder. None of this argues anything as you think it does.This country is going to hell because people don't know how to discuss things anymore.Take care. Extorted? You know that investigation is still going on, right? And the whistleblower had no information but about 4th hand info.So you are saying he extorted someone when the victim denies it, and when the investigation has found nothing. Unless you know the future and have access to facts none of us are privy to,  then you are not telling the truth. Lol politifact.https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/peter-roff/2013/05/28/study-finds-fact-checkers-biased-against-republicansSecondly, please forgive me. Technically you are right, but Trump didn't obstruct. The comment was merely a quip to show the user's comment was inaccurate and that this list of crimes they made is not true. I stopped listening because you have been twisting my worst from the get go. You argues dishonestly and aren't worth talking to. I didnt deny he broke the law. But you clearly don't know the details because you claim he defrauded people when that simply didnt happen.It was a fine. That's it. Grow up. Ok so everyone who has sped once, or got a parking ticket, or littered is a criminal. Gotcha. Again, putting words in my mouth.His campaign made a legal mistake and was fined for it. Yeah, that is breaking the law, so is running a red light. As far as money goes, this was like running a red light. Nobody got hurt, it didnt really matter but it was technically illegal so he had to pay a fine.I would say the law is kind of silly but it is still the law. I am not dismissing this as okay, but it certainly isn't the fraud you keep calling it.You don't seem to understand how minor of an issue this is. You are acting like he stole money when all he did was put it in the wrong account.It's like if you were given a check to donate to a charity, the check expires in 90 days, it's a rather large sum so you don't feel comfortable just holding the check, you also don't have an account set up for it specifically, so you put it into your account to hold briefly, filling intending to pass that money to the charity. You shouldn't have done it, but it doesn't make you a dishonest crook, it just means you made a bad decision.. Ok, you know that part where I said some ambassadors are personally known? Some are. Some are not.This doesnt change anything. Nice try though. Do not put words in my mouth.He clearly did something that broke the law, but it was a minor issue explained simply by not putting the funds in the write account. they probably thought it didnt matter and that the money would still get to the charities. This is why it was just a fine, you know, like when someone speeds on the road, that is breaking the law, and they might have to pay a fine but they are not actually a criminal? It's not that hard.He didnt need the money, there was no reason to steal it, everyone knew where the money was supposed to go, they just held it in an account they shouldn't have for the moment.Not a big deal, certainly not fraud. Ok, please explain what corrupt things he has done.This fine everyone keeps blasting him for was more of a banking error than anything else. So try again. https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/11/08/trump-foundation-saga-troubled-charity-ends-2-million-judgment/2532798001/Nowhere in the article is it called fraud. He just put the money in the wrong fund, probably thinking it wouldn't matter and that they would put the money where they need to, but it broke a dumb New York State law.A fine for putting money in the wrong spot is not fraud. Grow up. You can't obstruct when there is no crime, there was no crime. Defrauding? He doesn't need to, it sounds like it was more like a banking error and you guys call it fraud. Ok. Except he doesnt need to. Why would he? It sounds like they got him on a technicality and you all are taking it as criminality.The courts have been going after Republicans for a while and doling out fines and prison sentences to people who would usually just get a slap on the wrist.Dinesh Disouza had to spend weekends in jail for about a year because he gave to a campaign twice, amounting to a total of 10k, or there abouts. Other people pull this kind of thing and they get a slap on the wrists.You have the Clinton's filtering money from Haiti, and no one gives a shit, but if Trump uses some funds from the wrong coiffure you guys flip a shit. Defrauded? Misused and defrauded are different things. Don't be dramatic. Sometimes. Not all the time. Agreed. All these people made legal agreements with the state to receive these benefits.What this shows that something really needs to change and the privatization of benefits ought to occur. The more you just trust the state to pay down the roads the less money you demand in the moment, and so you have less money with which to invest. Are you saying Trump is a criminal? You aren't clear. Please provide the specific law he broke. And then please provide the evidence, and the trial, and the ruling for purportedly breaking that law.Oh, none of that has happened yet. So you can't say he is a criminal. Thanks for sharing this. Do you happen to have any links with this info handy? I'd like to have them to cite when necessary, but I know it can be hard to filter through old articles and find it. I didn't say I know for sure, but based on the evidence, it doesnt look like he did. Again, he is not on any flight logs going to Epsteins island. That's dumb. Most ideas are more complex than a fre sentences. Guys, you can hate this situation, you can think Trump is guilty as sin, those are valid opinions. But many times I see one little detail come out that sound so nefarious to you and the rage that I see makes so little sense. And I think it is because it is simply presented to you as nefarious by media that is trying to rile you up or is just trying to get clicks. So let me please explain why this particular detail is not an issue at all.There are over 160 countries in the world, let's assume we have ambassadors at only 50 of them (though it's probably all of them)... that's 50 people who we trust to go to those countries and do their job and check in with us... except they usually don't check in with the president, they speak with the State Department. They  might speak to the president directly for really important stuff from volatile parts of the world like China or Iran or Russia. So the president in most cases rarely has direct contact with these ambassadors. There are also many cabinet members, senators, and congressmen who regularly speak to the president. There are governors, there are generals, there are lawyers, there are private citizens.... and so on and so on. Will any president know all of the people he works with very well? No.He certainly won't know all the ambassadors very well, especially considering some of them are still there from Obama, and maybe even Bush? And that's fine, I'm sure many ambassadors appointed by other presidents have done great jobs and there is no reason to swap them for a new person... sometimes you really need someone who has built a strong relationship to stay on board.But even ambassadors who were directly appointed by the president were usually vetted and recommended by someone on the president's team. The president then meets them as a formality and signs the paper work. How often do you really think an ambassador and a president have a close relationship and really know each other well? Not often, sometimes though the president might want a specific person they know to do a specific job. But whether they know the person well or not, all the presidents, when hiring a new ambassador, will say "I know so and so will do a great job... he or she has a background that speaks to their professionalism and patriotism, and I have spoken with them and I know they will be a great representative of our nation." They all say stuff like that but they rarely actually know the person at all.Let's relate it to our lives? Have you ever hired an employee to do a job where you wouldn't see them much? Maybe you hired a cleaner who only comes in at night and just leaves some notes or messages for you. Maybe you are a regional manager and you hired someone at a store you only visit once or twice a year. For young people who might only work in retail, how well do you know the boss of your direct manager? How well do you think they know you?Not knowing an ambassador well is common. It is rare for a president to know an ambassador very well. It is rare for any of us to know more than 50 people well enough to really vouch for them as great people. And yet this article suggests that there is something wrong with it. They make it sound like the president is distancing himself, which makes you folks think he is trying to hide something. But the truth of the matter is he probably doesn't know the guy.The reason this is important to point out is because this story is enraging people. This detail means nothing, it really doesn't even tell us anything we either don't aleady know or couldn't easily infer: That no president intimately knows all, or even most, of the people with whom he or she works. The reason this is important is because rather than it being a valid logical argument, it *feels* like it adds to the story, it *feels* like it is meaningful... but when we look closely at it, it means nothing.Again, hate the president all you want, but do it for valid reasons. The reason this article suggests is not one of them. I'm willing to give the benefit of a doubt. But I tend to agree. Yeah, no one knew the Epstein stuff back then. I don't even think they connected until late into the second term or maybe after his presidency. I agree, mostly. The worst I remember pulling with my friends when I was young was ding dong ditching, and I didn't even do that, it was the new, more rebellious kids I started hanging out with who kinda coaxed me to go with them when they did it one night. We also littered, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose.That was a far cry from vandalizing cars, but teenagers frequently busted up jack-o-lanterns this time of year, or egged houses, or cut across lawns, or did graffiti. I knew some people who would get drunk and wander around their neighborhood, literally shitting in people's driveways and smearing it on their houses. They had hilarious stories, but I would be livid if similar teens did that to my home.I remember around 2000 there were some asshole teenagers who pulled a bunch of downed tree limbs into the road by Fairport High School at night. It was super dangerous.I knew kids who had sling shots, I imagine they flung rocks up in the air from time to time and hit some cars and windows, maybe even some of them did it on purpose thinking they wouldn't get caught and just sort of wondering what would happens.So I mean, it isn't exactly abnormal, but it does seem to be escalating. I can't imagine any of my friends, even the more rebellious ones, shooting at driving cars. But at the same time, there was the kid who dropped a huge rock from an overpass onto a car like 25 years ago maybe? I think that was here in Rochester.Also, some of the worse things that kids do these days are online. I heard a kid say how he tries to get older men to send him money by posing as a woman on dating sites. While he could have been joking, I don't think he was, and even if he was, kids have these ideas floating around these days and parents would never guess their kid would do something like that, so they could probably get away with it if they are a smarter teen. Based on the evidence, it looks like Epstein was sort of courting both Clinton and Trump in the same way. Except Trump never took the bait and went to Pedo Island. The only time Trump boarded Epstein's plane was to fly to Florida.If your business is blackmailing powerful people, I imagine you get the numbers of a lot of people and attempted to get them to hang out any number of times. In Clinton's case, he became a regular friend. In Trump's case, he went to a party with legal woman and flew to Epstein's home in Florida, and then later cut ties with Epstein after Epstein was doing weird stuff at Mara Lagao. We all keep saying kids (myself included) but I imagine these are teenagers, probably with one who is capable of driving, legally or not. So it could easily be the same people, but who knows? Yeah, I think it was along 490. But then there were reports along 104 if I recall.You'd think with all the cameras out there these days, someone would have spotted something. Thrive? The biggest ones were very diverse, the most powerful country to have ever been is a diverse one (that's the US). The Roman Empire was diverse.Germany, a homogeneous society, got too big for their britches and only exists now because the world let it exist. France, too. Russia collapsed. China is kind of the outlier, but modern China has really only been around for about 90 years, it sure is going through some difficulties as of late.It's weird how a society that oversimplifies ideas (or gets the wrong) tend to fail over ones that do not. Eh, he wasn't all bad. I wouldn't say he was good.He restricted gun rights. His education funding and standards continued the spiral downward in our education system (in fairness, it kinda sounded good at the time). He also set a bad federal standard for students with disabilities, this sounded good at the time and aimed to target a real problem (that schools might not try to help students with disabilities as much as they could), but this has led to some strange situations where schools are expected to do more for students than they really can, thus leading to teachers and administrators sort of fudging the numbers or not knowing what to do because they have to teach kids with the knowledge of a 5th grader how to pass a test designed for a 17 year old. He gave $20 billion to Mexico, how much of that went to the cartels do you think? He increase the power of unions by making it illegal to hire(typo) permanent replacements to strikers. He continued to meddle in the health insurance industry in ways that helped lead to the issues we see today. He kept spending money on things that enabled irresponsible parenthood rather than curbing it... most of that was complicated at best, while we want to help those people in need, it enables people to have children when they are not prepared by essentially subsidizing the risk, and those laws also pushed those bad federal standards for education that are crippling our education system, Or madame! Good luck, sir! This was actually a great thing that he did. He also was rather tough on welfare abuse, if I recall. He also spoke out against the victim mentality as recently as 6 years ago.Of course, he also appears to have victimized underage girls due to his frequent visits to pedo island. Fortunately, we can separate the good people do from the bad without our heads exploding. The left would probably try to undo these laws if Clinton is found guilty of something. And now the French have to deal with immigrants imposing foreign culture on their own. The French are good people with a rich culture and history that is as fascinating as it is has been influential. It would suck for them to lose that.Though I'm sure the left over there are arguing that the French Revolution and all the awful stuff that happened at that time means that capitalism and representative governments with a good balance of powers are bad things, even after having had a dictator who took over most of Europe. One final thing.You are criticizing me for responding when you continue to respond... this shows bad faith argumentation. Plus you keep saying I don't comprehend what you are saying. That is an ad hominem attack. Your argument should stand on it's own. Perhaps you actually don't understand what I am saying (which might actually be why I have to keep repeating myself), except of the two of us, you are the only one who keeps suggesting the other party is incapable of understanding. This is not a good way to argue, it's mean spirited, and you should be better than that.I have not done the same to you. Sometimes they work well. In this case I really wanted to see the dude collapse and hear what he said. And then if one of the staff walked over and yelled at them to leave while the one guy is curled up in the fetal position, that would be an awesome video.EDIT: typo It would be nice if we could afford more police to patrol and dissuade young people from doing this kind of thing. This is easier than reacting to it after the fact. These kids will probably just get away with it. It doesn't seem like the police can really spare the manpower to investigate this annoying but rather minor act of vandalism.Broken window theory is real. If people see that other people are not respecting the property of others, more will choose not to respect the property of others.Also, what ever happened to the BB shooter who kept shooting at driving cars a couple years ago? Were there any arrests? I asked you for one that changed the meaning of what he said because your argument is that he said something other than what I presented. Because you did not accept literary analysis, or a basic Englisj language analysis, you said there were multiple ways to read his meaning differently, including sociological. All you did was provide a history of the word which adds to the meaning of it. You did not succeed in adequately arguing why this comment of Bob's is as terrible as you claim.The problem for your argument is that the specific meaning of the n-word here is immaterial (so the history here doesn't matter). Again, he is merely comparing the quality of the words as slurs, he is not saying they mean the exact same thing nor that they have the same power. Nothing you said challenges any of that. Nothing here justifies your disgust or anger.If you forgot, he also said no one should use slurs at all, including the n-word in that tweet.Please explain to me why saying that two words are both slurs AND that you shouldn't use slurs makes Bob bad guy.EDIT: by the way, as horrible as your arguments are I haven't once suggested that you simply aren't smart enough to understand something. And yet you feel.it is appropriate to sling ad hominem attacks. That is a horrible way to conduct yourself. This is borderline xenophobic. Immigration is a good thing. Accepting immigrants who refuse to assimilate in reasonable ways like learning the language is a bad thing. Lol dude. You are giving me the history of the n-word as if it had explanatory power here. It does not.You have gone off the deep end. By the way, the reason I have been repetitive is because you haven't once negated anything I said. You have given no reason to believe what he said wa anything other than what I presented.You have only said that my logical and literal and English language analysis are invalid. And, instead you cite the history of the n-word.The TL;DR here is: **He is not comparing history. He is comparing the function. The n-word is a slur, and he claims boomer is becoming a slur. That is not bad. This is simple because that is all this is. Your job is to prove he didn't mean that or that it is bad. If you can do that, I will listen to you, otherwise, this is an insane dive into you trying to justify your hatred of the man.**Take care. And?People still call Bill Clinton a great guy. There are people I despise but I wouldn't just bad mouth them to the press.This argument is bullshit. It was a one off comment to a magazine. What the hell do you expect him to say? So you are saying "don't use language to look at something that was said... with language." You don't want people to look at what was actually said, you want them to look at what? How it made people feel? You mentioned sociology as well... please tell me how any sociological analysis will change what he said to mean something else.Or do you want to judge what he said based on how it made people feel? People say things all the time that a lot of people feel offended by and yet aren't offensive. Jeremy Kappel got fired for a slip of the tongue that people took as racist. Those people who felt offended were idiots and inserted meaning into that slip of the tongue that wasn't there.This is the same thing, except people just don't like his point and they don't like him so they are using all kinds of mental gymnastics to try and claim he said something he didn't.It is exceedingly clear he did not say the n-word is as bad as boomer and that his point is simply boomer is becoming a slur for ageism. Please though, use some sociological analysis to prove he said something else. Use some psychological analysis. Use anything. Just prove your point.There is nothing there. All that you have is that maybe he lacked tact in his point or that you disagree with his point. None of that falls within the realm of this comment being racist or insane. You know, most of us have ties to a pedophile. The odds are you know one. But you probably don't know they are a pedophile. Just having ties with someone doesn't mean anything at all.BTK the infamous serial killer had a family who had no idea he was a murderer. They had very very close ties with him and knew the man intimately. Are they bad people just for those ties? If they covered for him or they participate in anything he did, yeah. But just knowing him as intimately as they did while not knowing he was a murderer? Nope, they aren't guilty of having those ties.How many people knew Bill Cosby and perhaps even went out with him from time to time? I bet none of them had a clue he was a horrible serial rapist. And yet they had close ties to him.There are plenty of people in Hollywood who had close ties with Weinstein. Do you think they all knew he was a creep? No, some did, but not all.Having ties to someone isn't the issues, it's whether you have those ties and you know the person is a pedophile and do nothing. And then obviously if you participate.Trump actually did something though he didn't seem to know much specifically about Epstein's pedophilia. He spoke to investigators and was very cooperative when they asked him about Epstein.As far as I have read (and I'm not trying to make Trump out to be a good guy), but of the two presidents, Trump cut ties with Epstein in 2011 when he was being weird at Mara Lago, he only boarded Epstein's private jet once, and that was to go to Epsteins home in Florida. Prior to 2011, Epstein did host a private party for Trump with a ton of girls, but they were all legal. Clinton on the other hand, has a portrait of him wearing a dress on Epstein's island, he also actually went to the Island several times and went on Epstein's plane many times.Considering Epstein seemed to blackmail people, if he was trying to get evidence on Trump but Trump would just not take the bait, it would make sense that Epstein has a lot of contact numbers for both Trump and Clinton and that he would have tried to tempt both of them with lavish parties. Except in Trump's case, he didn't seem to take the bait and go to the pedo island.Maybe he could have gotten to the island secretly, though you would think if Clinton was caught going there and both he and Trump would go, then Trump would be more likely to be caught. Why? Of the two of them, who likely has friends in the FBI? Of the two of them, who is better at keeping a secret? Who seems to be far more gifted at lying? Trump is not quite, he is not good at keeping secrets, he had no ties to the FBI at the time or other government people who could help hide him. So it seems it would be more likely for Clinton to avoid being tracked there, and yet he is the one we caught going there.Again, I'm not defending Trump here, I'm just trying to make a narrative that makes sense with the evidence we have.It seems to me that Trump merely saw Epstein as a man who really enjoyed young, attractive women, who really enjoyed being wealthy, who was probably very personable and charming, who had tons of good connections, and threw parties reflected all of that. It seems that Trump did partake in some of that fun when it was within the US and when it was legal, though certainly not becoming of him, but he never went to the island and he only boarded Epstein's plane once to go to Florida. They actually cut way down on this. There was some law that was passed that holds the website liable for that, so they cut all of that stuff.But your point is still valid. Yeah, and even the democrats in the state know it. They just won't elect a Republican because they think a republican would be worse for some reason. Yeah, but the ones who illegally cross the border typically come from, you know, bordering countries. His stance is that he is holding his judgment for when the facts come in.You are judging him for taking a stance he has not taken. He is doing the smart thing and waiting for the evidence. Look at all these articles and get ready to feel profoundly stupid.[Here is an article](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-jul-05-la-me-jail-bedding-20100705-story.html) from 2010 that talks about how suicide bedding is ineffective.Suicide is impossible on suicide watch?Not that the NYT is the most trustworthy, but [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/us/mississippi-private-prison-abuse.html) is an article from last year, before Epstein killed himself.From the article (as it is behind a paywall):>According to evidence and testimony at a federal civil rights trial, far worse things were happening at the prison than inmates strolling around during a lockdown: **A mentally ill man on suicide watch hanged himself**, gang members were allowed to beat other prisoners, and those whose cries for medical attention were ignored resorted to setting fires in their cells.Hmm... it sure sounds like prisons aren't run very well, are they? Even when it comes to suicide watch... again, this was 2018 when the article was written. But suicide is impossible and only a cock sucking person like Ben Shapiro would believe it, right?Now the article is talking about a private prison. State operated prisons though are not a whole lot better. [Here](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/2017-07-26/understaffed-and-overcrowded-state-prisons-crippled-by-budget-constraints-bad-leadership) is an article about state run prisons and how they are underfunded and staffed, which leads to bad situations, you know, like suicide.>In California, where corrections facilities were an average of 175 percent over capacity by the end of 2010, some prisoners slept in beds that were triple-bunked, the inmate suicide rate was 80 percent higher than the national average, and a lack of access to basic health care led to an average of one unnecessary death every week, according to a report from the Marshall Project, a nonprofit that investigates criminal justice failures.Alright, that's Cali. But [here's an article about New York closing two prisons](https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/politics/albany/2019/03/29/new-york-close-two-prisons-part-state-budget-but-where/3309798002/). Where do you think those prisoners go? How well do you think they are being guarded?Ok, those are state prisons. [Here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/13/ill-equipped-and-inexperienced-hundreds-civilian-staffers-assigned-guard-duties-federal-prison-secur/316616002/) is one about FEDERAL prisons being understaffed.[Here's](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/08/22/federal-prison-suicides-rising-before-jeffrey-epsteins-death/2070689001/) and article talking about how the suicide rates have been rising since before Epstein... maybe these suicide watches have never been very good.When you think about how underfunded and understaffed so many prisons are, you begin to see that perhaps a camera malfunction is not that insane to believe.So turn your fucking bravado down and wait for the fucking evidence to come out.EDIT: You know, that last statement is unnecessary and the cockery I displayed at the beginning was too. It was for the other person with the far less balanced rhetoric. I got a bit confused as to who I was talking to. So forgive me for directing it at you. I will leave it as is though because the people that are acting like suicide is not possible at all need to calm down. Nice edge lording This. But we should also clear up misconceptions. For instance, it is largely thought by the average person that the Crusades were an evil, Christian incited war. The truth is that the Holy land was invaded and the Holy Roman Empire responded with the Crusades.Further, people in power have used religion as a means of wielding and exerting power through influence, Christianity included. Most wars through history that have any apparent religious impetus really began as a power struggle. The religion acted as a sort of catalyst, but the inciting action was always the desire for more power. The religion merely acted as justification for the action. Even when the Pope called for it, the power was foremost in reasoning, it had to be, because the scriptures never call for us to war with others. There might be righteous reasons to be the aggressor I suppose, maybe you are trying to secure raw materials for your people to survive (edit, I failed to finish that thought).The only case this is not true is in cases of religions that actually call the people to go to war. Islam does this, there may be others.That said, the stuff that Christians did within those wars was obviously not good and we should do what you say. Ben's stance has made sense this whole time. You are criticizing him for not saying it was definitely a hit? That's crazy. He admitted it sounded suspicious and that he would be curious to see the results of an investigation. He admitted there are probably people who were afraid of him talking. But that isn't enough to justify any assumption of a conspiracy to kill Epstein.Ben is right to say that it is usually more likely that incompetence is the cause than malice in these kinds of situations. That is a good rule to go by and it follows the "innocent until proven guilty" model.It is foolish to assume conspiracy without some strong evidence. One doctor initially said that while the vertebrate fracture was rare in such a case, it was not unheard of.But if you're going to commit suicide, most people tend to try in the time between the pretrial hearing and the trial. That is when Epstein died.Obviously more information is better, more educated opinions are better, but his stance was not wrong. It was prudent.Again, he admitted it sounds incredibly suspicious and that an investigation should obviously occur. He just didn't buy the conspiracy given the evidence at hand.To you that makes him a cocksucker? Unfortunately, this is becoming more and more true. But being in the field, it seems there are many factors involved. While legislation and public sentiments are a large part of schools getting worse, the culture of the school seems to be much more of a factor at this point.There are many laws about students and when and how you can remove them from the school, the whole process is very slow and not very accurate. And even with the training that teachers go through, they aren't psychologists or experts in language acquisition. Teachers know many strategies based on studies that may or may not be good, but are certainly trendy (hence Common Core and the mess that is). So we build up these programs in the schools that sound like they would be effective to the average voter, but are not. I don't mean to say they don't work at all, but the perception is not reality. And this is provable because, in places like New York State, we keep making new paths to graduation that are less strenuous. Also teachers and administrators keep making choices that push a kid through the system...There are the semi-understandable behaviors, like when a kid is on the cusp of passing but the teacher gives them a few points just to not have to deal with that student for another year. But there is also a lot of teachers who mother the students and give students far too much wiggle room in the name of preventing holding the student back or finding a better fit for them. They perceive that as devastating, and for some students it is. But life can be devastating for all of us. I tend to think it us far better to face these issues earlier rather than let the kid coast through school only to find that no one will let them coast forever, not unless they have very wealthy parents.We should certainly mainstream students as much as is possible, but we shouldn't shoehorn them into the mainstream because we think they might take an emotional hit or because getting that diploma is crucial. They are making diplomas mean less and less.Asserting a high standard for our schools, and not cajoling a way for all to meet that high standard is the only way to maintain it. By playing these mental gymnastics games, they lower the standard. What should have happened instead was that more specific standards be set for those who can't meet the regular standard. No student is a number but we need quality measurements of students for many things, and when colleges make decisions about students, they will look at the standardized tests above everything else because they are the only accurate picture of a student, being that the students get so much help from boosting grades to writing their college essays. Colleges can't trust the grades or the diplomas students get anymore. Also the government usually does stupid stuff. Not getting anything done is not bad. I didn't say they are enemies. Don't put that on me, it's dishonest.Also, we need socialists? I would say we need different views that are good. Socialism and $50 trillion in spending on Medicare for all are not good views. I didn't say it was appropriate. It hasn't met what we feel is worthy of impeachment. It certainly wasn't illegal. You are calling it blind partisanship. It is not. This is not true. The argument is that this was not inappropriate. In other words, most of us think the concern you address here is already explained.So the concern we are focused on is the fact there are people sitting in government apparently working to undermine the office of the presidency with any flimsy thing they can throw at him. Power tripping? So you are assigning I'll intent that was probably just a judgment call in the moment.And it sure looks like you didnt take time to rationally discuss it because you pretty quickly went to another sub and complained about being banned, saying the mods don't get jokes. Maybe your joke sucked, maybe it wasn't funny, maybe the mod misread it and would have corrected the error but you didn't speak with them civilly about it.People make mistakes but when something happens to you that might be a mistake, instead of being reasonable, you complain that it was because they are pussies who can't understand a joke.This is one of the reasons we dont feel particularly bad about it about banning fellow conservatives from time to time, because they aren't immune from childish behavior. If you wish to rectify what you feel was unjust, act like an adult.Instead, people like you and the OP are bringing this crap to a sub that was intended to discuss deeper issues of conservatism. You are wrong. All of your points serve to avoid that though I don't think you realize it. It is unfortunate because you seem quite intelligent.If something is true, then looking deeper at it should render the same truth. If something appears wrong but is true, then we need to look deeper to understand. We should look deeper at all things, but you are advocating not doing that in this case.You think it is wrong, I say it is not wrong. So we should look deeper at it. Again here you are saying we should not look deeper at and you are trying to confine the argument to avoid a "literary analysis" despite the fact it was a written comment that used literary devices to express an idea. That is like arguing that we shouldn't look at statistics when someone is making a statistical point.Looking deeper at things always helps.You wish to avoid looking deeper in this case for some reason, and that is unfortunate because this really isnt that deep. But because people are avoiding the truth of the matter, I have to go deeper to try and get you to see where you are making your error.You are not willing to do so and are avoiding it by claiming this is not a literary analysis. That is exactly what this is. It is also a rhetorical analysis.It is not reasonable to claim it isn't those things. So there is no point to continue.Take care. I would definitely leave. The discourse is bad enough as it is without the structure of the site changing to make it even worse.I want a place where ideas can thrive and long form discussions work. Reddit still has some of this but there are far too many people who use it just to try and destroy their opponent rather than try to understand each other. And I think a lot of that has come from it not being new and trendy anymore, a broader base of people use it now and the discourse has suffered because of it.We are all people but we all have different things we wish to get out of the space. I think reddit seemed to be a place for healthy discourse (though not without its limits, obviously). But it started to attract people who dont care for that and who frankly can't handle a more nuanced discourse.And it's not like we know when we are arguing with a 15 year old who just simply doesnt have exposure to the world that leads to a deeper understanding.That was a good thing for a while because the ideas would stand or fall on their own regardless of age or race or sex or whatever category we can put ourselves in. But now there are mobs of people who are more on a warpath than on a path to understand things better and refine their views. And then we have to defend our subs from that in a rather vain attempt to recapture what once was.A picture is worth a thousand words, but if you can't discuss something that is a thousand words, the pictures are worthless, too. If reddit is all pictures and short videos, then it is lost. I was driving a Buick a few years ago, it was huge and very stable, even in the snow. I wouldn't say I got cocky, but I got a little too comfortable and that is when I spun out on 390 and clipped a guard rail.A wet road in the winter is not that slippery... I mean it is, but it's just like rain. but if there is slush or snow on it, it can be deceptively slippery. Don't get cocky driving, give people space, and give yourself time. They would make a direct comparison to make the point that Boomer is becoming an ageist slur. They might make a direct comparison for many reasons. Any words are comparable. Saying they aren't is hyperbole. You can compare "feather" and "evaded". You can compare "hat" and "interplanetary". You can compare the n-word with "cracker". We do all the time, we say that both are slurs but the n-word is worse. Again, in the case of Bob, he is drawing the comparison not to say that boomer is as bad or worse than the n-word, but simply to say that it is more and more being used as a slur.When you say they aren't comparable, what you are doing is making a hyperbolic statement for the purposes of explaining that you feel the n-word is far more powerful than boomer. Hyperbole isnt bad or good, it serves a purpose, it adds meaning. But in this case, it hurts your argument because you are taking it as literal rather than a figurative statement.When you say that one thing isnt comparable to another, you are making a point that one particular quality of the two things are very different. "The Bills this year vs. The Bills 10 years ago? Incomparable."  Of course you can compare them, in fact that statement *is* comparing them. It is not a literal statement, it is figurative. We have to use the context to figure out what the statement really means, in this case it seems to mean that the Bills are actually doing well this year while they sucked 10 years ago.What is interesting here is that you seem to be making the statement literally. In other words, you seem to think you literally cannot compare the words.But you can compare the words across many qualities. How long they are, how similar they sound, whether they can be used as a slur or not, their origin, their meaning, their historical significance, how offended people get by them, how often people use them as a slur. This is not a full list, you can compare the word across a ton of different qualities.I would agree that the historical significance of the n-word and how offended people get with the n-word are certainly greater than that of "boomer". But that is not the point Bob was making. The only point he was making was that boomer now shares the quality of being a slur. He even specifies that after the statement you seem to be offended by.Lastly, as far as the word "fag" is concerned, it can still be used as a slur and still is. But most people use it simply to mean that something is annoying or dumb. Southpark did an episode that speaks to this point, and it is a valid one. It doesnt mean the slur meaning of "fag" is entirely gone, the point is that the use of it as a slur is becoming less and less where the use of it as something against someone annoying is becoming more and more. Words have multiple meanings and can gain or lose meanings. It is all about context.You can make almost anything a slur. You can turn "redditor" into a slur. You can turn "New Yorker" into a slur if you wanted. "Millenial" can be a slur, and perhaps it sort if is one. It's certainly not used in a positive light many times, but I don't think it is spoken with the same hate that I have heard the term "boomer" used with.Language is far more complex than you are making it out to be, and what is absolutely frustrating here is that everyone uses language in a far more complex way than they think, but then they don't recognizue that complexity when someone says something that others think might be offensive. If someone ever mentions race then many people seem to think there is only one way to read the comment and that is that the comment is racist.Unfortunately, none of your arguments really challenge any point I have made. Again, you can despise Lonsberry. I guess you can even think he is a racist. But his comment does not say that the n-word has the same power as "boomer", it merely argues that "boomer" is becoming a common slur against older folks in the same way that the n-word is a common slur.Take care. Ah, I see what this is. So are you saying you evaded a ban?Regardless, you are criticizing moderators for not acting fast enough? You know that we work with the reports we see, right? If we dont see a report someone made we might miss a comment. Sometimes comments get reported very quickly, some dont get reported for weeks. You are still missing the point and are hung up on something that doesnt negate the point. All he is saying is that it has become an epithet of ageism.Also words evolve fast. In ten years we went from "fag" being unacceptable to just meaning "annoying person." But to the main point...You are basically arguing his point is bad because he didnt use the word "like". Because he didnt say "boomer is *like* the n-word except it's for ageism," you wouldn't be hung up on this 1-to1 comparison you claim he is making.Here's why this is utterly insane: this is basic English class. "That kid is like a bear" is an indirect comparison known as a simile. You know the kid is not a bear. The comparison is making the point that the kid is big and strong or maybe kinda vicious, it doesn't matter. If he said "the word boomer is now a lot like the n-word because people are using it as a slur." That's true, people are using it as an ageist slur.That's an indirect comparison. You can also say "that kid is a bear". Like the other sentence, you know that the kid in this sentence is not a bear. You know it is a metaphor and is not literal. Except in this case the language explicitly states the kid *is* a bear. The only difference is the word "like". It turns it from an indirect comparison (a simile) to a direct comparison (a metaphor). A metaphor is still not literal, the kid is still not actually a bear. The reader still knows that the writer is merely saying the kid is acting bear-like in some way. This is closer to what Bob did, but he actually did a sort of hybrid.First he makes a direct comparison "Boomer *is* the n-word"... that is the direct comparison. Still, he is not actually saying they are the same, he is merely comparing them. He is not actually saying "boomer" is the "n-word", this is obvious, because they are obviously not the same word simply because they are spelled differently. That part of his comment is the metaphor like part of it. But then he makes it indirect by turning it into an analogy. It is the "n-word of ageism" he says. That makes it an indirect comparison. It's just an analogy. The n-word is to black people as boomer is to ageism. Chink is to Chinese people as the n-word is to black people.All that analogy shows is that the words are similar in the way that they are derogatory terms for that group of people. If he said "boomer is the chink of the ageism" it would be the same exact thing. He is not saying one is worse than the other or that they are exactly the same level of vile, they simply have the same function. That is it.An analogy like he made is a multifaceted comparison. It does not say they are just as bad as each other.This is basic English studies. When I was a very young adult, I joked about it. I cringe when I think about because it is so disturbing. I hadn't heard all the depths of it, it's way worse than I thought with what you describe. I upvoted you. I don't know who is so hurt by your comment to downvote you. If they ever said it, it was sarcastic. We don't believe in safe spaces. We merely try to run and operate these subs as islands in a sea of leftists.We ban people who break rules. We make judgment calls. If you sound like a troll and give us nothing to work with, then we'll ban you. We also make mistakes and are willing to rectify them so long as the person doesn't flip out and acts reasonable. We are also willing to forgive, again, if people are reasonable and respectful. We're decent people. It's the situation that forces our practices to be what they are. When do they say they are a safe space? This is overly cynical. The mods are hardly beholden to reddit's business model, they dont make money. They can make the subs however they want.The problem is the quality of the discourse. We have loads of people who come to troll, but a lot of people make comments that sound just like a troll because they dont speak respectfully and they just make rather sarcastic one off quips.If we have a scale from 1 to 10 about how respectful and clear the discourse   of a group of people are, in real life people probably hover around 7 or 8, real debates might be 9 or 10. Trolls in real life are at a 1.Online, trolls are at a 1. But the average level of discourse is only at like a 4. So you get a whole lot more people who sound like trolls on line even if they are honest conservatives. This is a loaded question. So lets break it down a little.Safe spaces were invented by the left and they serve a specific purpose that is now confused with something we have always been doing. We have always set up groups that set certain standards of behavior and speech, and when people break those rules we kick them out. Schools do this, you do this in your home, malls do it, stores do it, courts do it, NBA games do it, bars do it, colleges do it. Everyone does this. This does not make them a safe space. People took the time to make their organization, business, group, family or whatever into what they wants it to be from the conception of the group. They all found their own spaces and then secured them as they saw fit.What a safe space is is similar but not the same. A safe space sets up certain rules about who can talk, what they can talk about, what behavior is acceptable, and what is not. Except instead of getting their own space from the beginning, they would go into a shared space that they can't claim as their own, and then establish these rules that have nothing to stand on because they dont actually have a claim to that space. On top of that, they would support their "triggered" friends by shaming any dissenting opinion, bullying people out of a space they had no right to control. This is essentially what happens on places like r/politics.So colleges cracked down on that because it is stupid. They (these groups who made these "safe spaces") started playing more by the rules and would sign up for a space with the school. This is what they should have done from the beginning because this is how adults do things and this is the non passive aggressive way of behaving.The final really stupid piece of this is how infantile it is. If you can't hear an opinion you dont like without exploding into tears that can only be stopped by beanbag chairs and coloring books, then your group is pretty pathetic.So a safe space not only sets rules about proper behavior and discourse, but does it where they have no business doing it, and then act like complete imbeciles who can't handle their emotions.In regards to bannings in more conservative subs, this is what happens. 1) we hope to establish as open a forum as possible, 2) the internet happens.People are prone to being nastier and more aggressive online. They dont like long responses, they dont explain themselves well, they misread each other, etc. So what happens is that trolls start doing their thing, but then a lot of people make a lot of comments that seem trollish. Maybe they make some joke about Cruz being the zodiak killer and how he sucks for some reason.Okay, you can think that as a conservative, but it sure sounds more like you're being a troll. What then happens is the mods will review the comment, the thread, and the user's overall comment history. We do not want to ban someone just because they had a less than kind word about a fellow conservative. So we try to give the benefit of the doubt. If they have made a bunch of comments that sound rather conservative but just have some issue with Cruz, we can probably let it pass with a warning (as we tend to expect that we *respectfully* disagree with our fellow conservatives when we disagree with them). But if we see nothing at all in your history to indicate any positive feelings about conservatism or Republicans or any conservative leaders, then we assume you are a troll.This gets more complex with suspicious accounts.So if you feel the banning is bad, consider how bad the discourse is among everyone. Conservatives are not immune from making shitposts. Conservatives are not immune from making catty quips about the president rather than explaining their opinion in a clear and thoughtful post.This leads to banning people who might actually be conservative or Republican or whatever. It wouldn't happen with better discourse. But internet discourse is cheap.EDIT: some typos and clarification. Wow, time to move to Texas. Language evolves. Words gain different meanings over time. Your argument here treats language as static and unchanging but that is not true. Look at the word "fag". It went(typo) from a bundle of sticks to really derogatory term, to a slightly derogatory terms and now most people who use it just mean someone is annoying and it has nothing to do with sexual orientation.The word retard was a technical term not all that long ago. It has turned into a derogatory term because people would use the term for people who just maybe did something boneheaded.Words change. The way people are using boomer here is becoming a slur. Sometimes the hate behind the use of the word makes it a clear slur. But it is also a word people still use simply to refer to a particular generation without any hate behind it. It's like the word "autistic" you can say someone is autistic and it simply be a specific description, or you can call someone autistic to make fun of them. Boomer is turning into something that a lot of ageists are using to deride older people. I think your reading of events is a little too cynical. It is certainly true that the GOP, especially lately on the national stage, are not doing much to curb spending (though there were some significant national tax cuts), saying that they just sort of shuck and jive to run on taxes being out of control and then do nothing is not really fair.Imagine a married couple that don't have a great marriage because they always vie for power over the other. One of them is more willing to spend money on things, the other is a bit more cautious about spending. Neither is even close to perfect and you would hope that they would balance each other out.So the spending one (let's say wife for the sake of argument) signs up for cable service while the hubby off somewhere on business or something. The husband gets home and finds out the wife spent the money but it's too late the money is spent. The wife thought it would be good for them, maybe it was, maybe it wasn't. They talk and maybe even they agree that they dont need cable, but they are locked into a year. So they pay for it each month. When the end of the year comes, the guy takes charge and starts to do what he intended to do... but now the kids are getting upset because they know they won't have Nickelodeon, the wife is upset because while she knows they can't afford it, she was really getting into the latest season of Better Call Saul. And as the husband is trying to cancel, there are all these fees, they keep trying to get him to stay with the company, he gets mad, hangs up. The wife second guesses then decision and suddenly they are fighting, and in the chaos, the year passes and they automatically paid for another month.Was that the husbands fault? Not really, at least not at first, but he didnt fix the problem like he said. It was really the wife's fault. Did he lie about his intention to keep costs down? No, other issues came up that made it difficult to just cut the service.I am not saying that the GOP is perfect, and I am not saying that there hasn't been a lot of spending on their part at times. But typically it is the Democrats who create the spending problem and then going back to where we were is harder than just starting the spending. It's hard because people never want to lose these programs. So the Republicans who want to cut spending always are painted as the bad guys.Again, they aren't perfect by a long shot, but aren't the ones suggesting a $52 trillion Medicare for all plan and letting that crazy genie out of the bottle. They aren't suggesting free college for all and letting that genie out of the bottle. They aren't releasing hundreds of criminals onto the streets and letting that genie out of the bottle which will undoubtedly lead to more crimes, more court costs, more prison, more life lost, more rape victims... and so on.Those are costs that Democrats run up and then somehow they make the Republicans look bad when the Republicans can't untangle this costly mess as easily as they'd like. This isn't really true. Albany can be out of control and yet you can still work to lower local taxes as well as attempt to stand up to Albany. Even property tax rules are exerted to a degree by the state lawmakers, usually in regards to limits. The state could easily lower the limit which would cut taxes depending on if the tax rate is above this theoretical lowered taxes rate.So it is not wrong to say that there are people higher up the food chain who control more of the taxes in the area. Who should get all the blame? I think it's silly to assign it to one party or another without looking at the larger picture.Not only that, but if one party puts some kind of expensive program in place, it is harder to just cut taxes as Dinolfo might have liked to do, you have to pay your bills. It's like if I want to stop paying so much each month for all my expenses but I dont actually cancel my Netflix account first, then I can't stop that spending then. So you also have to look at who is creating these sustained costs. Frankly I dont have the info on that, I'm just saying it's relevant and might change the perception. Republicans tend to at least talk about cutting programs, but it is hard because that is always unpopular. Once you create a program, people expect it to stay even if it kinda sucks.I'm not saying the local GOP is good or bad, I'm just saying that her argument is not as disingenuous as you make it out to be. There is a local conservative radio personality here who tweeted that (and I'm paraphrasing a bit) "Boomer is the n-word of ageism. Just because an epithet is cool and new doesn't make it right." He got so much shit for it because he was "equating" the two words. The dude wasn't saying "boomer" is as bad as the n-word, merely that they are both epithets. Boomer is one in the realm of ageism against older people, and n-word is one in the realm of racism against black people.The sub for my town went batshit crazy over it. I mean he could have had more tact, but his point is ageism is getting worse. That's all.I'm tired of people thinking this ageist behavior is okay, and I'm tired of no one among them standing up for reason and telling them why it's so foolish to have all these ageist sentiments. This hatred of the older generation has been used to gain power in dangerous ways. Mao used it,  Hitler used it... it is this feeling that the older certain just doesnt understand and are this standing against progress.It's scary, man. Lol Because I believe in the principles of free speech. I believe even a racist's point ought to be treated just like any other speech. It should be analyzed and interpreted based on the content of the message and nothing else.Now, I don't know that this guy is racist. I tend to think people are unfairly labeled racist because a lot of comments (like this one) are taken as racist when they are not. That said, I have not seen the evidence people have claiming he is a racist. If it is valid, I'd still defend this comment, because people shouldn't twist things just because they don't like the messenger. If Hitler made a valid point, I'd give it to him. I wouldn't want to, but if someone is right, I will say they are and if someone is wrong, I'll say they are wrong.A point is valid or not, it doesn't matter who says it. Defending a valid point is not also defending the character of the person who made the point. By that logic, we should toss out everything MLK said and did because he was a womanizer. It doesn't make sense. Good lord... this is absolutely insane.How about you ask him what he meant? He will tell you exactly what I said.Stop trying to make people out to be evil. Usually people make points that aren't that far off from what you believe, but you just might not understand what they said. Instead of thinking them evil, maybe consider the possibility you are wrong.But whatever man. Keep demonizing the people you disagree with. It has, we hit the 15 year mark and the first graduates who have been through an entirely common core schooling have turned out to be the least prepared for college in 15 years.It's unfortunate. We used to be able to consider more complex ideas. But now as soon as any mention of race is brought up, whatever unfortunate soul who decided to make a point is torn down as a bigot or racist without even considering the argument.And what's worse is the journalists who feed into this and make it worse rather than challenging the narrative. They should have a firm grasp of English and defend it, but they aren't. Fortunately, no one really gives a shit about the D & C anymore. It's a rag.There are one or two decent writers at it now. No, you are twisting my words.He us saying boomer is being used as a derogatory term, the implication is that ageism is getting worse.You can also use the n-word in an endearing way. You can use cracker in a negative and a positive way too. That isnt the point and doesnt negate the point. No, he compared the terms. He didnt not equate them. There is a difference, we learned this in school. It's not hard.Equating terms means he is saying they are exactly the same. Comparing the terms is intended to point out similarities and differences. But a comparison does not mean you are saying they are the same. There are similarities between the words because they are both now being used to deride others. He did not equate them.This is the difference between similes and metaphors. You can say, "bob was like a bear," or "bob was a bear". The second example is a direct comparison saying that Bob *was* a bear. The writer obviously doesnt mean bob was actually a bear, the writer is drawing comparisons. A metaphor is a more assertive way of making the same comparison, in this case, to a bear.In Bob's case, he was direct in his comparison. He was not equating the terms. He was drawing a valid comparison. The point being that boomer is being used as an ageist term. That is all this meant. Reading more into it is dishonest.Hate the guy all you want but at least be honest about what is said. This is dishonest. I didnt defend a racist, I defended English and proper discourse. You think it's insulting. Okay. So by that logic the n-word is fine. I'm not dying on this hill. This sub hates me anyway. I lose nothing but I stand insert some reason into an otherwise unreasonable thread. By that logic you should disregard socialism or communism. Those took entire books.Some points need to breathe. Not everything can be boiled down to 2 or 3 sentences. It's unfortunate people dont have the willingness to look that deep into things anymore. It's leading to a lot of anger. I don't entirely disagree. But his point should be read as I have described it. It is the most reasonable way to read it. And we should be reasonable people.While I tend to think people ought to be more careful, it is on us for not taking his comment at face value and reading nefariousness in it that really isn't there.But that's the whole issue. It comes up a lot. It's like a husband can have a friendship with a woman that isn't his wife that is very friendly and familiar. It is possible to have that but it is smart to tone down (edit) that familiarity as it might make his wife feel a bit jealous or insecure. He isnt doing anything wrong, but it could easily be misinterpreted as such.This is what happened with Lonsberry's comment. It is a valid point he is making, it's just the way he made it kind of triggered that sensitivity that seems to come with any mention of the n-word, even when it's just a sort of clinical, disimpassioned look at it. I failed to address another point you made.You seem to be saying that he is also claiming that boomer is now a universal term for ageists to use. And as such, you seem to imply that any age related term is thus ageist. That is not how language works.Some people use the n-word and mean nothing by it, some people say it with it's full derogatory meaning. Boomer is now a word that is used in a derogatory way by some and those are the ageists, boomer is still a valid term to simply refer to a group of a certain age.Older people can use the term millennial in a negative way. Or generalize about millenials. And it can even become ageist. However the anti-boomer sentiment is far scarier. I mean wishing people would just die off? How messed up is that and yet that sentiment is plastered all over social media and gets retweeted or upvoted by an alarming number of people. People who say millenials are snowflakes are generalizing but they are claiming they are snowflakes because they are millenials.In other words, there is always some tension between generations. But the contempt the younger generations today have for the older generations is dangerous. The older generation needs to understand that they aren't innocent in this rhetoric issue, but they are not the ones saying things will be better when millennials die off.. I'm not defending him, I'm defending reason.His point is not what people think it is. That is all. I''m a millennial. But it's nice that you think only boomers could think this way. Which proves the whole point. Boomer is has been taken up as ageist term.I dont think you folks realize it because it seems to casual and funny. But it is ageism. Of course he is drawing a comparison. But it is not a direct comparison. This isn't complicated.Here's an example. "Car crashes are the plane crashes of the sky." They are both crashes, but plane crashes sure seem scarier, right? This is not saying they are the same thing, merely that they relate to each other in some profound ways. "The Irish are the hicks of the UK." This compares the Irish to American hicks. It is not saying they are the same thing, they are obviously not the same thing, it is saying that the relationship between hicks and the more average people of US have a similar relationship as that between the average UK citizen and the Irish. (This is just an example, I'm not saying this comparison is a strong one at all). These comparisons do not say that one thing is exactly the same as the other thing, or even that they are very similar. You have to use your brains to think about how these things are similar. Usually it is apparent in the context, in this case Bob clarifies what he means.He is not saying boomer is as bad as the n-word or that they are exactly the same. Guys, I'm not even mincing words here to defend the guy... what you think he said is simply not even close to what he said.The whole Mulaney bit is how people foolishly say that the n-word is AS bad as some other word like "chink" or "cracker". Mulaney's bit, to apply it to something else, making fun of people who say that car crashes are as bad as plane crashes. He is not saying you can't compare these words. He is not saying there are no similarities, he is saying that one is clearly worse than the other in how it affects things.All those terms that are used to deride an entire group of people perform the same function, just like the n-word. But they are obviously not as bad as the n-word. Bob never said that boomer is AS bad as the n-word. He says boomer now has the same function as the n-word, which is to deride an entire group of people.I cannot believe how insane this guy makes you folks here. This isn't complicated and you are all smart enough to understand this and yet you seem to want it to be worse than it is because you hate the man. This even more clearly shows that he is not equating the two words, rather he is pointing out that people are using the term boomer as a derogatory term attached to ageist views.You don't have to agree with him but please do not make the claim that he is saying that boomer is just as bad as the n-word. He is clearly saying that boomer is the term ageists use against old people to deride them. He is comparing their function not their emotional and historic relevance.This is not the same thing as mulaney is taking about. I can see why people might think that at first glance. But that is not good point.There is usually one word people latch onto to deride a group of people in a bigoted way. For black people it's the n-word, for white people it's cracker, for old people it's boomer (according to him). He makes no indication that his point is that any of these words are better or worse than the other, merely that they serve the same function. Obviously there is history and emotion attached to the n word that surpasses all the other ones, he is not suggesting otherwise.You can still think its awful, but think it is awful for the right reasons. He has a point, I think the reason this is awful is because it is framed in a way that achieved exactly what people here are doing with it. In other words, people are sensitive about the n-word so they are going to feel like this is far worse than it is. Its really just a tact issue. His point is not entirely off base. Ageism is bad, guys. Except Hillary got her due process and was found to have actually done wrong, they just didn't pursue a case because Comey was waxing about intent. Trump has not recieved his. These chants were not based on equal cases so we weren't doing the same thing (EDIT: forgive me, I wasnt clear here). It was found that Hillary broke the law, but Comey decided that the intent wasn't there so he didn't recommend prosecution despite intent really having nothing to do with it. No one intends to be criminally negligent. Hillary got her due process, but the guy in charge just decided not to pursue the case further.Trump has had no due process. With the formalization of the impeachment hearing, perhaps he will... but it is not a criminal hearing, so he might never get his due process. Forgive the length. I would hope you take this seriously though as I am trying to be respectful of your critique here. On to the argument:No, I am critiquing his brand of argumentation as dishonest and pointing to his history of attacks as evidence that speaks more to that dishonesty. Yeah, I added a little bite to it because I'm tired of it. But my points are all logically sound and I never attack his character, only his tactics... I don't know anything about him other than the nasty, catty dishonest way he argues against me and maybe a few other comments of his I see from time to time. By the way, when I say dishonest, I dont mean *intentionally* dishonest. I dont know if he just thinks he is arguing on the up and up or if he is intentionally making ad hominem attacks and is fully aware of his behavior.He could be the most upstanding moral person ever off of here, he could also be a huge dick, I wouldn't comment on that because I don't know... I only critique his behavior here and his arguments here. He almost always attacks me rather than debates any point, and he attacks with nothing to back anything up except dishonest tactics.... like attacking my conservatism rather than the point at hand, or twisting what I said in the worst possible way instead of taking it at face value. That is dishonest. And the only time I have ever attacked him (at least as far as in recall) is when he has done these things. It is not an attack to call out someone else's attack.I do indeed appreciate his holding back on the ad hominem attacks here. It is rather frustrating to see them get upvoted when so often his arguments are void of substance *except for* the attacks. But his past behavior and his behavior here are clearly a pattern indicative of dishonest argumentation. I do not apologize for pointing that out. He is a bully on here and should be stood up to rather than defended. You may not like me or my views, but you shouldn't stand for what he does. And I dont think you are, per se. I think you are more trying to argue against me than to defend him, but in this case, doing so also tacitly defends his behavior.So I'm not sure why you would jump to the defense of this guy, even tacitly. Which is fine, I can take it. I've had my run ins with you, too. Although I think we have actually agreed from time to time. I'm not sure. But I'm not one to back down.But back to boner79... If someone's main tactic is to make ad hominem attacks, then the only thing to address is their dishonest style because their argument has no substance. Again and again this user argues with ad hominem attacks, twisting words, or using other logical fallacies, usually the more aggressive ones like poisoning the well. Again, it is not an ad hominem attack to point out bad argumentation and bad tactics of the other person. Thinking that is bad would be like saying the boxer who is doing his best to fight honestly can't point out when the other boxer is cheating by putting horseshoes in this gloves.It would be nice if I were not the only one who called him out. It seems because many people here know I am conservative, they are quick to find fault in me, but I never attack or twist people's words even remotely as bad as this guy does, though I'm sure I make mistakes. I misinterpret points people make, and so I have mischaracterized points. I've even jumped to false conclusions or made assumptions. But I avoid it all as best as I can, and in avoid all ad hominem attacks. I also don't belittle a person just to dismiss their argument, I try to argue the point. If they make their bad behavior the points then I'll argue it. While I have repeatedly seen people try to discredit me here saying "this guy posts to r/conservative, dont listen to him." or some other iteration of that, I would never dream of using that tactic against someone here.... even if I did, no one here would let that fly. Imagine if I said "boner posts in r/democrat. Don't listen to him." I would be downvoted to hell, and people would jump to Boner's defense. But if that dishonest attack is used against me, I get almost nothing. I have gotten support from time to time, but I've gotten far less support than the users who made those nasty attacks seem to.Anyway, this guy has never given me the respect of arguing honestly and treating me like a human. I don't even mean niceties and pleasantries, I mean simply arguing honestly and not making ad hominem attacks. I don't need niceness, I'm certainly not always nice. I'm assertive which doesn't always feel nice, but I only make a biting remark to answer a biting remark and usually it's to point out that their remark was dishonest. Again, I'm not perfect, but my behavior is very consistent. When I'm speaking with fellow conservatives, I might generalize in a less civil way, but I wouldn't hold it against liberals for letting their hair down with other liberals and saying nasty things about us. It's when we meet in shared spaces we should be civil and temper our more aggressive language.If I make a point about bad behavior or dishonesty I always back it up with evidence from what was said. But it seems a lot of people would rather side with him in his bad behavior because they don't want to side with me in my arguments, presumably because they tend to have a conservative sort of bend to them, but I can't say for certain.I make some points that I know will be unpopular, I get it. There was a guy complaining about the local GOP putting a sign on his lawn. I agree that that is annoying and not a good practice, but I thought it was silly how upset it made the user when it seemed like it was rather innocent mistake. I was shit all over, I'm fine with people disagreeing... but why be angry about my point, you know? Especially when my point was calling for people to be less prone to anger and more prone to not taking minor mistakes so seriously. What is wrong with that? I was shit all over for standing up for decency... why? Was it because it spoiled the anti-GOP hate party that was happening? That's the only thing I can think of because I know there are a lot of decent people here who would otherwise agree with a point that calls for more patience and civility.Anyway, this guy acts like a jerk to me on here. I'm sure he's a much nicer guy in real life, and I'm pretty sure I've seen him be kind to people on here in other threads. But he's always been nasty to me. And I have never made the first move, I just make a point and then he comes in guns a blazin'.No where in here this comment have you seen me attack anything other than the specific behavior I have seen from the user, nor have you seen me assume anything about him... I only used the evidence at hand and put nothing on him that wasn't true. And yet if you go through the history of comments he has made to me, you will see repeated instances of dishonestly twisting my words among many other less than decent behaviors.I would hope everyone would stand together in telling people who act this way to knock it off. How about actually addressing what I said instead of dismissing it entirely? What? I never said anyone was a victim or worse off than another group. I said that ageism is getting worse. This is a dishonest critique. I didnt repeat it in a positive light, and that is a dishonest way to argue against my point. I didnt say it was good or bad. The point was that he was making about about sexism, not equating the plight of black people to the plight of women. Likewise, Bob wasn't equating the n-word and boomer, it is more reasonable to say he was making a point about ageism. >Yes, I do. In fact, he did. He just did it today.If he actually said the term "boomer" has just as negative a history as the n-word, I'd call him out. But all I have seen is that he made a point saying that boomer is becoming a derogatory term in the way the n-word is. That is a valid point. I would need to see the evidence of it and I'm not seeing the twitter link. But you would need to prove he actually said this and wasn't just making the valid point about ageism.As far as what I have seen in the thread, it seems everyone is taking his comment and twisting it into something it wasn't. Lol another word of wisdom from boner79, the guy who thinks ad hominem attacks are valid points.You know who Socrates was right? He came up with the socratic method, largely responsible for the rich philosophical history the west is based on, as well as, you know, science.Anyway, he took the best of an argument and debated that rather than doing what you are doing here (and pretty mich everywhere I see you argue) which is ignore the totality of the main point and dismissing the point for superficial reasons. Socrates would have looked at Bob's point as I did and he would have mocked your point as being dishonest.You are being good here though. Well, I mean you aren't making ad hominem attacks, which is nice for a change. Your argument is not good though. Lol that is just as bad. Substitute "black people" in for boomers in that quote and tell me if it sounds okay to you. It won't. Now that isnt a perfect means of proving ageism, but it's a good red flag that if you replace "boomer" with "black person and it sounds racist, then the original might very well be ageist.https://www.reddit.com/r/Rochester/comments/bkzg5z/a_look_into_rochester_ny_rap_scene/emkkxvxHere's another comment from a thread I remember. Now, the fact it got any positive votes is upsetting. And I'm pleased to see that some users called him out on it. But you'll also notice my comment pointing out the ageist sentiments was downvoted. I'm glad the thread turned around but this is not isolated. It doesnt come up a ton, but when it can come up naturally it does.I'm not trying to make this sub out to be a haven for ageists, I'm just saying I'm seeing it a lot, either very overtly as the comment I linked to, or in a more subtle way, as I pointed out in this thread. Yeah, and that proves it is a derogatory and ageist term. It assumes the older person can't understand. It's not the worst brand of ageism but it is ageism.That point is an interesting one. I have had many conversations with boomers about this kind of thing, and I'm of the generation that really first started losing out on what the boomers benefitted so greatly from. So I am far enough removed from the youngest and the oldest in this feud to be able to more easily take a step back. It is pretty clear that neither of the perceived sides has it all correct. There really are a lot of things boomers and the following generation did that put younger generations at a weird disadvantage. And there is also some credibility to the boomer complaints about the younger generations. As for the boomers doing wrong, I usually cite the fact that they didnt protect the youth from the internet. Porn addiction is a huge problem, and boomer parents were not at all prepared to handle the dangers of the things that the internet brought into our homes. I saw some of the first cyberbullying and it was brutal... the boomers didnt protect me from that. So anxiety and depression rates are spiking because the older generations didnt help the younger generations learn to handle that stuff. And rather than everyone taking a step back from the internet, now they are giving smart phones to 10 year olds.But one of the things the younger generation doesnt understand about that situation is that it was entirely new to the older generations, too. They didnt know what the internet would be and do. They didnt know just how horrible the things kids could find on the internet could be. So we can't blame them entirely for their failure in protecting us.The real blame should be on all the people who did nasty shit on the internet. It wasn't my parents fault I was cyberbullied, it was the asshole groups of girls who perpetrated the bullying. My parents shouldn't have had to protect me from that. But they did and they failed. It wasn't my parent's fault that there were a bunch of creepy pervs in chatrooms, but they did fail in keeping me out of them and knowing that they needed to.Anyway, my point is that this generational feud is blown way out of proportion. If we talk about climate change, do you really think the average boomer had any understanding what climate change would even be, let alone what they could do to change it? The younger generation acts like they boomers caused all these problems when the truth is that life just progresses. The trajectory of the world is not one generation's fault. Even when you think about slavery, you can't say the founding fathers were some horrible cause of inequality, many of them hated the idea of slavery but it was the way of the world at the time. You can't just suddenly change the trajectory of the entire world even if you are enlightened enough to adequately see what is wrong.This is one of the valid criticisms against these younger generations. They are generally quick to blame others when the truth is that no one generation is to blame. Racism didnt start with the founding fathers, it has always existed when power dynamics and ethnicities clash. Good societies work to slow racism, bad societies use racism to assert power. The US, from the beginning kept trying to reduce racism. We can't expect the world to be at a 10 with racism and that a new country would magically be perfect. But the younger generations do act that way.So you have these young people looking at boomers who really had no idea about climate change because that was all just novel sort of fringe science at the time, and then blaming them for not doing more. That's like being mad at us for not stopping the horrible human trafficking and organ harvesting China is doing when all we knew at the time the started it was rumours on Alex Jones' website.Everyone needs to calm down. Everyone getting so keyed up is far scarier to me than climate change. This shit is going to lead to civil unrest and maybe war. I dont think that will happen anytime soon, but if this keeps up, it will be more and more likely. We should be furious at the leaders and the media that have fed this but instead, so many are digging in their heels. That wasn't the point. As I said elsewhere in the thread, John Lennon wrote a song called "woman is the nigger of the world" he wasn't saying "woman" is worse than the n-word. Or that the c-word is worse than the n-word. He was making the point that women are discriminated against all over the world. Lonsbury's point is that ageism is getting bad and the term "boomer" is thought of as negative by so many people these days.There was just a meme somewhere insane about the Irish being the n-words of the UK. Are those people saying "mick" is as bad as the n-word? Sicilians have been called the n-words of Europe. Are they actually saying Sicilians have had it worse than Africans? No. These are comparisons about power dynamics based on race or ethnicity.This is where I wish people would be more intellectually honest. And I dont mean to say you are intending to be deceptive, people just aren't thinking this through. Do you really think Bob would be so stupid as to say the history of the term "boomer" is as bad is the history of the n-word? Do you think that he believes boomers dealt with slavery or segregation against them? Of course not. That is not his point. You may not like the guy, but he isnt a complete idiot. So why make his argument out to be the argument of an idiot, especially when there is clearly a valid point in there?It is terrible for discourse to do what so many people in the thread did to Lonsberry's point (I can never remember how to spell his name). This has been ruining the conversation lately. We see it a lot with Trump and the way the media misread his comments intentionally. Now the dude says a lot of dumb stuff, but a lot of what the media claims he said, he didnt actually say, they just read something nefarious into the comment. This baffles me because you could easily argue that he says bad stuff without misrepresenting what he said.This happens all over reddit. This happens here, especially against conservative types. It's not healthy. They don't see it. They are too busy thinking the past ruined the future while they enjoy vaccines and amazing technology that delivers anything they want via drone and self driving cars. They believe the rhetoric that the earth is doomed just like the people in The Village believed monster would kill them if they tried to leave... they are being controlled with fear. Climate change is real, climate alarmism is a fear tactic.Healthy concern is okay, but this fear they have is breeding hate, and that is more disturbing. And then they share stuff like "be the change you want to see in the world" meanwhile they aren't making the tough choices, they are just voting for people to force others to make the changes they won't voluntarily make themselves. They are forcing the change they want to see in the world while avoiding it themselves. Passive aggressive behavior is designed to trigger. Practice aggressive behavior is getting much worse, and unfortunately it is getting worse with the youth. The discourse is being destroyed. You're not. And you are assuming things about me based on nothing other than what you think my politics are, and you are dismissing points based on that alone. You are by definition a bigot. Truth be told, I hate the term snowflake and I get called it by leftists far more than I have ever used it myself. Usually they use it when I point out they are not being intellectually honest. It's ironic. Making generalizations about people you dont like rather than facing the point? Sounds like something a bigot would do...Take care bro. Be honest with yourself. No he made a point about ageism. John Lennon famously said "woman is the nigger of the world." Was he "literally" comparing the terms? By your logic he was, but that's not true. He was saying women are discriminated against all over the world, even in black cultures.Be intellectually honest. Yes, it is. But as i said, this is just from this thread. There has been far worse I  this sub.This hoop jumping people like you force into an argument is a logical fallacy... this "oh yeah? Prove it!" crap. While proving your arguments with evidence is obviously valid and important, people like you use that to stifle conversation and points you dont like.There is ageist crap in here a lot that is worse than what I posted. Rignt, which is stupid because that wasn't the point. You are making his point something it isn't too discredit it. This is a common strategy of yours, boner79. Are you serious? Here's two right in this thread. They aren't the worst I've seen. There's tons of baseless bashing of older people and conservatives in this sub. It's disturbing. https://www.reddit.com/r/Rochester/comments/drkkav/bob_lonsberry_getting_ratiod_you_hate_to_see_it/f6jabdbhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Rochester/comments/drkkav/bob_lonsberry_getting_ratiod_you_hate_to_see_it/f6j4qrk It's not just the word. The ageism is clear here. And it's not everyone, but it gets upvoted. I wish this were true. I think for many it is, but a lot of it is just ageism dressed up as wisdom of the modern age. This is disturbing I'm not a Lonsbury fan, but he's not exactly wrong here. Boomer is used a horribly derogatory term these days, I've even seen it in this sub. Is it as bad as the n-word? No, of course not, but that's not the point. There is some nasty ageism going on lately. Some of you just seem to be waiting for these boomers to die.... how screwed up is that? That is the point. It depends on what that move is. Guys see porn and they think a girl just dropping to their knees would be awesome. But men are interested in starting families, too. And they typically want a woman they had to conquer, in a sense. A lot of women, when they are very attracted to a man will be in close vicinity but turn their back to him. This is an invitation and a test. They want to know if the man will make the move. The turning of their back was their invitation to you to show whether you are going to make your move as the guy.But the brilliance of this move that women make is that it forces the man to make a move. *This is their move*. Or it is one of their moves. This is also a natural sort of consent. By making this move, the woman is basically saying that you can make yours if you wanted to.There is a scene in A Bronx Tale where the young man is getting advice about girls, particularly about kissing. The advice is essentially that as a man, you should go in for the kiss, but you only go in about 90% of the way, you stop and let the woman go the final 10%.A lot of first kisses start this way. Both sides test each other. So even. Before that first kiss, there were many other steps where the girl or the guy sort of made an invitation, and the other party then accepted it. This all starts way at the beginning. If you make eye contact from across the room, if she spots your looks down briefly and then looks back with those come hither eyes, she is making the first move. She is saying "I am interested, the ball is in your court" and you as the guy either decide to approach her or not. Then you approach her, you put something out there as an invitation to her, some kind of greeting or some kind of line, maybe you politely ask if you may sit down next to her. That is all an invitation to her, you are deferring to her to decide if this goes the next step. If she says yes, or if she greets you, then she has accepted the invitation.When you dont follow this protocol, then you are skipping a lot of steps that show to the person you are interested in that you are willing to abide by the boundaries of the other party. Each one of these steps is a point where there is a natural boundary, and each step defers to one of the parties to decide whether the other can move inside that boundary. It's not even a tradition so much as it us natural. Animals do this too... watch cats and dogs. There are boundaries, invitations, and choices that both parties make before copulation.Breaking with this pattern indicates something is amiss. And while skipping straight to sex may be pleasurable, neither party has really shown any kind of respect for the boundaries of the other. You can obviously jump right into bed with someone if you want, but each of those steps is important to bonding with the other person.One of the most beautiful things is when you have done this all right and you get to the point where you are about to kiss, and you move in so close and then she gives you that last little bit. Honestly, for me, that is better than the kiss itself, that moment that she chose me, that she accepted me and actively worked to do so rather than just letting me go in.There is no one move, but if your talking about the woman making the first kiss happen, I find that I'm never as attached to those women. The women you want most will make you work for it.... and they will make moves, but they are not the moves you're talking about.EDIT: grammar This should be a model for healthy political discourse as well. Too often do I see people dismiss a view based on one snall thing they disagree with (often in error).Let those smaller details go for the sake of argument and discuss the larger points. Suspend your disbelief so that you may consider things more deeply and sufficiently. I have faith we can pull through this... but every country falls at one point or another. Nothing is permanent. I'd be a bit more careful with the rhetoric about war... we are dealing with a skittish, angry bunch. That may be an inevitability, and I suppose it could happen at any time... but I think that is pretty far off if it is to come. It's really not that he did something improper, it was the appearance of something improper... which is sort of improper.It's like there is nothing wrong with a married man having a casual business dinner with an attractive woman where their personalities click really well. But the appearance of it would cause some worry in the wife of that man. Perhaps only a little bit of a worry, perhaps a lot of worry. I don't think a single woman would be completely comfortable with that.I look at all the factors and I don't think Trump did anything wrong at all. We have a treaty with the Ukraine and most other countries to investigate corruption (signed in 2002 or so). We also do not want to give aid money intended to fight corruption to a group of people who might not be doing what they should be doing. So holding up the money to double check is prudent.The problem is the appearance of misdeeds. And people especially need to watch out for this when people don't trust them. If you are on parole, you are earning society's trust back, meeting up with your old drinking buddy will not bode well for you even if all you were doing was catching up over tea. The wife of a husband who has cheated on her will scrutinize everything, just getting home an hour late from work will get her wondering what he was doing.Trump, unfortunately, has a severe Trust issue, not only with the insane left, but to some degree with the right. We know his past and we have forgiven it, but we also rightfully worry there might be something in the past that is just bad enough to ruin everything that might bubble up to the surface any moment. The left is not so forgiving, at least not when the person they would have forgiven is now leading the party they hate. And the same would be true for us to some degree if the situation were reversed... although we tend to focus on more substantive issues that are actually threats to the country (tend to, not always). So there is a valid reason to distrust Trump beyond just the natural level of cynicism we should have towards all leaders. The left takes it way too far, to the point of paranoia/derangement. This is why I think we all wish Trump was far more careful on Twitter and would step out of the spotlight sometimes to let the left eat itself.But there is a level of impropriety even when you aren't actually doing anything wrong because it appears bad. That is his crime here, which is obviously not a crime. It is a legitimate issue though because it leads to a weakness and undermines his presidency. The left rightly argues that our saying "other presidents pull this stuff all the time it's just not scrutinized to the same degree" is not a great argument. It kind of isn't, I mean it's true, but it doesn't defend Trump's behavior. And of course our argument is not really to defend his behavior or attempt to excuse it, it is more to point out the insanity of having a government so fixed upon ridding one party from the game. We are trying to point out how scary that is, how scary it is to have justice nominations that consistently get these incredibly accusations thrown at them in what is clearly an attempt to stave off a legitimate conservative justice simply because he is conservative.That is a valid concern and it is far more concerning than anything Trump did. Unfortunately, we have to take what Trump did seriously and let the chips fall where they may while also fighting this insane behavior by the left. That's why it keeps seeming like we are losing because we are fighting like 8 fronts, and we are always on the defense. They can just pick whatever they want, twist ideas, and we have to correct the record, we have to remind people why the electoral college because they largely failed to teach it in leftist controlled schools and colleges. We have to defend the right to free speech because they don't teach the reason why it exists and how it works. They can claim Columbus was a genocidal maniac by taking a letter out of context and then pointing out how many natives died... we have to then roll our eyes and explain those deaths were caused by disease and then explain to them with a lot of support why Columbus wasn't the shithead they make him out to be. No one wants to stick around for the long explanation that unpacks all that is wrong with the statement that Columbus was a genocidal maniac... that is why they keep seeming to win. We don't have those arguments to throw at them usually. We have to sit here and listen to them call us racist for supporting cops and how they arrest people simply because it is indeed true more black people are arrested per capita than white.It's insane. I do also see it as a nothing burger mostly. However I'm not willing to shut down the conversation because I don't think it will be a big deal. I think it is valid to look at the reasonable possibilities and at the same time looking at the things that people are doing to combat this stuff or how the market is responding, and so on.But I'm also open to the idea that it could be a net benefit. The point is that it is perceived that it is perfectly verbatim. It could be, but we don't know. When people think transcript, they typically think it is verbatim. Granted, transcript is not an inappropriate word for it. But I think this term forces us to look more specifically at what it is, what it's weaknesses are and what its strengths are. Otherwise they think it's just a document that Trump could quietly be editing himself or something. I don't know, I'm really nervous about this next election. And it's not like this will end after that. This has shifted from a gentle pendulum swinging left and right into a more volatile situation. I'm okay with teaching about the legitimate aspects of climate change, but the alarmism is not good at all. I fixed the typo, I was not trying to make you out to be a jerk.I will just reiterate, your language that you used was overly dramatic. That is a fact. It is not a misinterpretation.It's like when someone at work calls you a dipshit all the time and you get mad and call him out and then he gets all "I was just kidding bro. It's your fault your mad because you don't know I was kidding." You can't say someone is misinterpreting you when you are using language that expresses exactly what the person perceived.You were dramatic. You shouldn't be. It's lame. Exacerbating the problem? How? By pointing out that being so against one party in this sub is absolutely ridiculous and shows what a bubble it is?People were very critical of the local GOP, fine. I'm just saying that is nuts considering the local DNC has run this city into the ground, and the state DNC isn't helping. My point is that the nastiness ought to stop and I pointed that out by showing how easy it is to criticize the democrats in this state and in the local community.People need to stop acting like Republicans are monsters. They get all up in arms when they talk about Sinclair Broadcasting, when virtually all the media, including those Sinclair run local affiliates are full of left leaning reporters and owners. Virtually all of mainstream media is left and yet they get upset that Sinclair runs that Boris guy that no one watches? Have they not seen how the mainstream media is parroting exactly what the Democrat leadership says about all the issues? Does that not alarm you more than Bottom Line with Boris? Come on. It's like you guys are gas-lighting the country but don't even realize it. Nope, what I'm saying is Socialism is one step before communism. Taking a bunch of baby steps towards socialism doesn't seem smart and the amount of control you end up giving to the government means the following steps can happen very quickly.Your analogy is bogus. No problem. It is a memo, just a specific kind. Well they are correct that it was not a transcript though everyone, right and left, keep calling it that. We call it that because it sounds more exact, they call it that because it sounds like it's more easily doctored than what it actually is. The truth is that is is a "memcon" which means "memorandum of conversation". It is not necessarily word for word, but it is close. The method for keeping these has changed over the years from what I understand. But the point is that it is not a perfect transcript of what the exact conversation was.The method though is pretty solid and it would require a lot of tampering by a concerted group of people to actually alter it. I suppose it is possible, but there is no evidence of that at all and I doubt any one thought the conversation was a problem at all at the time. Why doctor something you aren't worried about, you know?I think dems like "transcript" better because it sounds less official than what it is, and thus, more easily messed with. Memcon sounds so official that the average person probably rightly assumes it isn't that easy to tamper with. If that. I would love to see this as well. I bet a lot of local FOX affiliates might preempt it.I also dont really think it's a good idea for him unless he has some strong commentary about it.What I'm hoping for is that this formal impeachment hearing will do what all these things have done, and continue to destroy the credibility of the Democrats leading this charge. There are some things Trump should not have done, but under normal circumstances other presidents have made very similar requests. These are discretionary things that many leaders do. That doesnt excuse the behavior, but it points out that these are not normal circumstances. This is a fucking witch hunt. This is a group of covetous people eyeing what other people have, eyeing a betterment of their positions, and eyeing a power grab and they are all working together, they all have their eyes on the same prize, and they all are willing to break tradition or even the law to get it. This is Salem and this is McCarthyism all over again, except this time it is an attempt to get just one man. We have rules in our sidebar and a message under every post that reminds users that this is a sub for Republicans. The reason for this is because r/politics is basically a cesspool where leftists circle jerk and berate anyone with right leaning views (though sometimes I'm surprised at the responses to some comments), so we maintain this sub as a place for us to discuss the days events without that kind of harassment. R/politics is obviously the worst, but most of the big, purportedly neutral subs behave the same way: r/worldnews, r/technology, r/atheism.... even places like r/rickandmorty or r/pics will do it if anything political comes up.This sub was originally intended to be a place where all could come and discuss with the hopes that non-republicans could come and learn what we believe and hopefully get some people coming a little closer to the right side of the aisle. We still hope that happens, but based on the behavior of many reddit users, we have had to pivot and simply maintain this as a place that is friendly to Republicans, because if we can't keep Republicans here, then swaying people closer to our side is certainly not going to happen. So now we have to kick people out when they come just to argue or spout off about us or the president or whatever.We moderators do remove comments and ban people when they say things we hear everywhere else because we literally hear them everywhere else. This puts us in a bit of a predicament because while we want to keep this as a nice place for Republicans as possible, many Republicans use reddit just the same way everyone else uses reddit. Their comments are often just short jabs showing little respect for their fellow Republicans. I don't believe most people who comment in that way actually mean to be disrespectful to fellow Republicans but they end up sounding just like the leftists. So when a Republican comes in here, and perhaps they are more of a moderate, and they blast Sen. Cruz with a quick, insulting jab about how he's the Zodiak killer and is a piece of shit, then those users sound like they don't belong here and aren't really willing to discuss in good faith. And so we get the reports and we look at the reported comment, we also look at their history in our sub, and if it all looks kinda bad, we still try to give them the benefit of the doubt and poke around their overall history.If there is nothing indicating any positive feelings at all towards Republicans and they have done nothing but bash Republicans in our sub, we just assume they don't belong and kick them out like all the other leftist trolls that are easier to figure out. This leads to legitimate Republicans being kicked out.Frankly, we don't have a ton of time to deep dive into a user, so we make quick judgments. We get things wrong sometimes, and we will reverse them if people are polite, rational, and don't fly off the handle.So take a centrist stance some times, that's fine, just make sure you aren't insulting us. Or if we think you are just concern trolling with an otherwise innocuous comment, we might ban you too. We get that a lot. Marx said socialism was an important stepping stone towards communism. So a half step towards socialism is just the approach towards communism of an apprehensive bunch of communists-to-be. Frankly, I think there should be a class action lawsuit of some kind. Common core has been a disaster, and it undermines more students than it helps. I'm not sure on what grounds, but this whole thing has been a social justice pursuit that cited cherry picked studies.They rely on these studies that will of course yield positive results, but then they don't look at what is lost. I always tell people that I bet you could increase memory retention if you yell a lot. So you create a study with teachers yelling certain facts that are really important or something, and then yuo test the students and it'll turn out the students who were yelled at with the most important information actually did better. So then academia jumps on this and develops it more and it's this big circle jerk, and suddenly you have Common Core 2: The Yelling.Sometimes the standard rote learning is the best, that doesn't mean we shouldn't pursue better results with other options, particularly for students who struggle more, but fitting the teaching around the students who struggle most, creates a system that doesn't help the ones who could be the most successful. You bring the bar down for everyone. It's insane.So I think parents with kids around 7 or so should be banding together to sue or something because clearly the system is screwed up and the money you are paying to schools is not yielding results. Though that would probably backfire and ruin everything because this stuff is all controlled by leftists. Certainly, but what has happened is a disconnect. Parent's cannot help their kids with this stuff because it is entirely novel. The most successful students tend to have parents who are more involved regardless of the crappiness of the teacher, curriculum, or state standards. You did imply that with how you chose to speak. You may not have intended to, but your choice of words clearly reads that way.Look I'm not (typo) trying to make you out to be a jerk, but you should know what your language and behavior does.Your post calls these patterns disturbing and disgusting. If it's just a minor glitch, there is nothing disturbing about this glitch. It *could* be disturbing. Like if instead of no thumbnail there was a thumb nail of a bloody dick or something... that would be disturbing and disgusting. Or if it was intentionally done against you, that might be disturbing.By being so offended by this you sound like you believe someone wronged you. If you do not believe someone wronged you, know that that is how it sounds.If you get a receipt from Applebees that says something deragatory, that is disturbing and disgusting. If you get a receipt from Applebees that didnt quite populate the item that was ordered, that's just a glitch that's kind of annoying. The words you chose made this into an incident of wrong doing against you when it is nothing of the sort. Whether that was your intent or not, that is what your language said.My sister used to lose her shoes a lot or she would put them in a spot my mother was not happy with. My mother would put them in the acceptable spot. When my sister went to look for her shoes, she either lost them herself or my mother put them away in a bin. If they were not the bin she would get frustrated and say "someone stole them!" She didnt understand that the only people who could have stolen them were members of her family. She didnt realize she was accusing us of stealing her shoes even thought she was saying someone stole her shoes. She didnt put together how much of an asshole she sounded like arbitrarily and nastily accusing her brother, mother, and father of stealing her shoes. Like we are that cruel and would gaslight her just for fun... come on.This is what your choice of words has done. While this is not a big deal, you should be aware that your choice of words affects how people perceive you. Frankly, I'm not sure how so many people didnt say something. Acting like this is a normal way to go about solving a minor problem doesnt help you in the long run because people dont put up with that shit so readily in the real world. But your language implies that someone is like fucking with you or something. Or that someone is so negligent that it is disturbing and alarming to you.It's just an internet forum you get to use for free, it's probably some minor glitch. I know the standard And my argument was not "everyone does it" to distil my argument down to that is dishonest which means you are not a person who argues in good faith.Take care This is too nuanced a point for them to get. I read a variety of publications. The ones that push the narrative of illegal activity are just as bad as fox on the issue. At least with fox you know what you are getting with the NYTimes, people think it's not biased but it is.What Trump did isnt good but it also isn't using-the-FBI-to-spy-on-a-pilitical-opponent bad. I'm not whatabouting here, just trying to put this in a context for you folks who act like this is the worst thing ever done. Presidents pull this kind of thing, it just doesnt get leaked by everyone because there aren't usually so many people around who want to take down the sitting president. That should be the most disturbing part of all of this, but no one seems to care.We have treaties to investigate corruption for each other anyway. What Trump was asking for was something that made some sense. "You know that money we're sending to help stop corruption? You know you could use it to investigate some possible corruption. You know, like we all agreed to do back in like 2002 or 3?"At best for your argument, this is a gray area that Trunp shouldn't have gone down, but it doesnt look illegal.I would really hope you guys applied your standards more equally, because what Obama did was way worse than this. Thanks for posting an unreadable article from a source with a less than stellar track record.By the way, knowing something is held up is not the same as believing it is being held up for purposes of coercion. Ever sign for a loan? Funds get held up for many reasons.Why is there not also the plausible narrative that after the discussion, the release of funds was expedited.I'm not saying either is definitely the case, but assuming the worst is kind of a shitty thing to do. It's certainly a valid question. But overly dramatic. Good, now the only politics we will see on twitter and Facebook are the thoughtful, nuanced, and respectful posts that people make. This is likely not true. The Ukrainians didnt know the funds were held up. Agreed. It is unfortunate and thank you for the comment. I think if it weren't for a rather small percentage of people, there would be much better conversation here when partisan poltiics come up. So I think it is almost capable, but it doesn't usually seem that way.If the most negative and insulting characters here who shut down the conversation actually showed their face, I doubt the discourse would be so bad. Anonymity makes monsters of us all, I'm certainly no saint, though I like to think I've gotten far better over the years.It is also hard to separate. This all seems like one big communal space, so when you make a jab on a partisan political sub about the others guys people are very quick to take offense rather than thinking it through. Like I don't go poking around r/democrats and think "hey, I bet they have super nice things to say about people like me over there!" Just like if they come to r/republican and hear the folks there use some hyperbole like "the democrats are all dirty commies," they are talking amongst themselves and letting off some steam. If that same rhetoric is then brought into politically neutral subs, then things get shitty... or if people look back in your comment history and take a comment out of context. I don't think all or even most democrats are socialist idiots, but I might make such a comment with more right leaning friends. (edit) And I don't even think all socialists are idiots... even the idea of socialism obviously has a spectrum of stances within it... I know some very smart socialists, but among my right leaning friends I might just say they're idiots. I wouldn't do that here because I don't literally think that (end edit). If a girl listens into a boys locker room expecting to hear only nice things, she will be disappointed, same way with boys listening in on girls. We let loose when with people of more like mindedness, and that's okay. If we use that against each other, then we are not being very mature (though you can still cross lines of course).Anyway, the point is we should all be more adult about this stuff. Though that's hard when I keep finding out 14 year olds use reddit.Perhaps in this spirit, I should delete one of the points from my above comment... but it seems like nothing but ad hominems from that dude and I don't really think it is wrong to call them out. Can we stop with the partisan crap in this sub? We get it, everyone here is Democrat and you hate Republicans.It's rather silly to make these catty comments in the sub of a dying city that has been run by Democrats for 30 years or more in a state that has also been run by Democrats for 30 years or more, and has the worst population growth in the union because of policies Republicans had nothing to do with.We get it, this sub is almost entirely Democrat. Do you really think the Democrat party is clean? Shall we talk about Lovely? Come on, guys. Let's be reasonable.EDIT: watch [one user in particular who always does this] make some ad hominem attack that doesn't address the point at all, but will get upvoted.If you want the discourse to be better, keep the jabs to the political subs.EDIT2: Also, I'm not making that point about democrats as a jab, truly. I'm making it as a point that neither side has a stellar record here, so punching down at the minority opinion, which happens to be Republican in this city, is not really a way to converse well. It is a way to build a bubble. Almost. These items or services could have financial value or other forms of value.If we are being strict about it, then perhaps those stickers shouldn't be allowed. I mean they are innocent enough to not cause a problem, but they might have a negligible incentivizing quality to some people and it might disincentivize some voters (as crazy as they might be) from voting because they hate stickers.People shouldn't vote just because they can, they should have a reason to vote, and one that isn't just told to them as they are being shuttled by someone to the polling station because they want their party to win. I hate to be contrarian, but that's pretty messed up for a kid that age. I think this is incorrect. A former president and secretary of state is incredibly relevant to everyone. These are leaders that still hold a lot of power despite no longer being in government and who have a lot of money. Crimes of the wealthy is always relevant.The reason this hasn't been all over the news is presumably because none of the new pertinent information has been revealed. This is only new information that has come up in months, so either those investigating this are keeping a really tight lid on everything (which could be for many reasons), or because they haven't really found anything yet (which could also be for many reasons).Something that is this level of corrupt reaches a new sort of consideration that unfortunately is a valid one though we would hope the truth trumps is all. Morally I believe the truth should be told, but truth can destabilize. What if it was found that so many of our top leaders had been found not only participating in the illegal sex on the island, but helping with the human trafficking by using their power to either stop an investigation or to mislead investigators. If it was just the Clintons, you would think that that would just be a massive hit to Democrats and sink their credibility to the American people, but it would bleed all over. There might be people in the FBI, CIA, NSA, the Congress, the Senate... holdovers from Obama... there might be good people who just listened to Clinton on a seemingly small issue not realizing they were allowing something big really go unchecked. Anyone involved, any institutions involved, any procedures that failed to catch this would all be in question.In other words, this could be so bad that it would destroy everything we have built. Perhaps not in a way that just sort of exploded the country and leads to civil war for some reasons, but in a way that would require such a drastic action that would make us very vulnerable to a tyrannical take over of some kind.Imagine just 20 big time officials and all the people they hire and help out and work with. Now deligitimize all of that. What if the CIA was using Epstein in some illegal, black budget, covert operation, and they swept in and scooped all the evidence, so those investigating couldn't expose the CIA. That's just our people.Think about all the *world* leaders... think about what these folks might have talked about on this island or did for all of this. What if Bill Clinton pulled some strings with someone in the CIA, who pulled some strings with some folks at MI6, who colluded with some Russian operatives to secure some top notch illegal tail for one of these parties. It wouldn't be so much about getting the girls, I imagine that's easy enough for these folks, but hiding the fact that they got the girls and that the trail leads to Epstein and all these elites would probably be how they get involved if they were involved beyond the rape.Suddenly you have a multinational emergency and an extreme stability issue all over the world. If somehow China or Russia stayed out of this mess and they got their hands on any of this information... they could and would weaponize it against us.This is obviously all just musing about reasons things might not be revealed and why it might be better (at least from a global stability standpoint) than  getting all the information.While we are all incredibly curious about what is happening and what the investigations will reveal, we may never know the truth. If we knew exactly why JFK was assassinated, if we knew it was part of a quiet coup or something and we all saw just how vulnerable our country was (I'm not saying this is true, I'm just saying it's a possibility) then things would go very badly for our country and the world.It is also possible that Epstein has almost no dirt on anyone except himself and maybe Bill. The lack of information but the belief there is a trove of it out there could serve to create a conspiracy theory which might be useful in counter intelligence. It could certainly be used as a means to destabilize our country to some degree thinking there is more to the story than we have been told. Thinking our institutions are hiding something from us. But it could also be worse than the alternative which is knowing just how corrupt all our institutions are.Anyway, the smartest thing to do is simply wait for whatever information we might get to come out. Her parents picked it for her. She is being used. She mentions that it is important to recognize the transatlantic slave trade.... ok, you mean the one that was largely perpetrated by Muslims rounding people up and selling them to the west? I'm fine with recognizing that, too. I was just hoping they'd all make good on their threats and move to Canada or something. Lol it might actually work on them. And weighed 213lbs. Is there a way to get the socialist wing of the party to... leave? https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/doj2c2/trumps_stated_plan_to_loot_syrias_oil_reserves/f5p8tetI'm sorry if I misspoke. This was the dishonest section. It implies pretty much what I said before: that war crimes are okay for some to perpetrate. That is not a fair thing to put on me. I would tell you how if you didn't start with the dishonest comment. If you are confused as to why it was dishonest, keep reading.How horrible is it to assume the person you are talking with is okay with war crimes? How horrible is it to talk to someone who is discussing in good faith and right off the bat imply they are defending war crimes? You know that is a horrible thing to do and I didnt do that back to you, I simply called out the dishonest attack.I look at Antifa as terrorists, but I know there is a nuance there and a media that defends them and so a lot of people on the left think of them as a semi organized group of protestors. I don't start off my criticism of people who support them with "so you are okay with domestic terroris.... gotcha," because that dishonestly assumes they are a monster who supports terrorism before it even remotely gets close to their point. My comment in that scenario would shut down discussion and make an enemy out of a person who is a fellow citizen and probably a decent person in general.That is what you did and I do not discuss things with people who do that because I am not going to sit here and dig myself out of a hole that you put me in when you imply I am okay with war crimes. Does Elon's home batteries have fire protections built into them? I imagine on the off chance one fails, it can be very dangerous. Yes, you are attacking through mockery. That is not a good way to converse. You are also taking points and twisting them... not good either. Right, because that is an honest interpretation.Be better. If you want the discourse to be better, maybe you shouldn't dishonestly attack a point this way. And you should want the discourse to be better. Otherwise you get 4 more years of Trump, which I'm fine with at this point. It wasn't a 1 to 1 analogy, obviously, do don't be dishonest. Also, that is something that the UN was designed to help and yet doesn't. Look at Darfur and other recent genocides where the UN couldn't do anything.The point is you guys are getting all alarmist when Trump is spouting off as always. Secondly, securing oil is a valid thing to do. Looting it, no. But securing it yes and that is likely what he meant.The news today is like "Trump said X. Why that makes him a dictator." and the proceeds to take him out of context and gets all you folks alarmed for no reason. There are checks and balances in place, including many people the president has to check with and who can refuse illegal orders, like ones that would be war crimes. He was mo advocating a war crime, but if he was, it wouldn't happen. Imagine you and a group of people who play Fortnite form a coalition. Some of these people are close friends, some don't really know you, and some really despise you. You happen to be the best Fortnite player and have attained all the extras you can get. You formed the coalition because there were some serious disputes about fair play. So your coalition gets together and it passes some resolutions everyone thinks is nice, like if you lose, you can't threaten others with real physical harm... they also pass a rule about swearing on mic for the sake of younger players. Everyone is on board, but everyone knows these are barely enforceable, everyone knows these a gentlemen's agreements more than anything else. So then your group sees a real problem: loot boxes. They are addictive and expensive and seem to make the game more unfair. Now, you personally have no problem with loot boxes, in fact you enjoy them, you have gotten many and don't plan to stop. You can also afford these loot boxes and youve benefitted a lot from them. But a group of people in the coalition really would love to be at your level, or failing that they would love to knock you down a few levels. Now everyone knows loot boxes aren't the greatest thing in the world, but they have helped you advance and enjoy the game more, though you do agree that if there were a better alternative that you would pursue that (and to a large degree you are without any push from this coalition). Still, loot boxes are claimed to be a massive threat by a growing numbers of members in your coalition.So a committee forms, which you are not a part of. They meet privately, discussing evidence and studies you are not privy to and discussing plans to help mitigate the problems caused by loot boxes. You see that this committee doesn't include you, and in fact it includes this guy Josh who hates you and teabags everyone all the time and is an all around poor sport... he also kinda sucks and has nowhere near the k/d ratio you do. Other members may not be so against you, but certainly would love to see a giant fall. This affects their view of loot boxes to some degree... it makes loot boxes feel way worse to them because not only does everyone agree they aren't really good for the game, but some players have benefitted far more from them than other players. Never mind that the players that benefitted from them the most also worked hard to achieve money to buy those loot boxes and did not impede others from doing the same, in fact, they're hard work and good fortune actually led to others getting work. Never ind that you and the more experience players who have benefited from loot boxes always defend the little guys during play from being bullied by the less honorable players. Never mind all that. You benefitted from loot boxes, you are too big, you are too powerful, and you must be stopped. So the UN committee creates a report with suggestions about how to fix the perceived problem with loot boxes, and basically it is aimed at you "no one can spend more than X on loot boxes." They think stopping the purchase of loot boxes by the biggest purchasers will somehow make the game more fair. Meanwhile, you know that anyone can achieve what you did with some talent, luck, and dedication. Maybe if the teabagging trolls actually tried to make friends, they would have some people to rely on to achieve more, but instead they just teabag and troll. Despite that, they come up with this resolution. You and maybe one other are the only one who can afford X on loot boxes, this is aimed at you and really won't solve the problem the coalition wants it to solve. But it will make you weaker.So what do you do? Do you stay in the group and a ide by their ridiculous resolution or do you say to them, "listen guys, this is not a good deal for me and it seems aimed specifically at me despite me being the biggest defender of all of you... so im not signing onto this."Why should you be beholden to them?Why should the US be beholden to the UN? The UN does a lot of stupid things. Just because it's a coalition that doesn't make it good. Our people are self sovereign, the world doesn't decide for us. People act like the UN can do no wrong but it is a paper tiger in a lot of ways and a weaselly legislator in others. The allegory I wrote is similar to how countries that hate the west decided things about carbon emissions without input from us. It's good to have a coalition for a variety of reasons, but being the top of the food chain, countries lower than us will use it to try and knock us down a peg and they will frame it as them just trying to help others.It is politics guys, be cynical about these coalitions even if they sound like they are coming together for the good of everyone, they are all watching out for themselves. It means this is a common tactic to deny and stifle the conversation. This is used more often as a means to shut down something someone doesn't like rather than "legitimately asking". 1. True2. True, but easily changeable and the market is responding to this.3. Alarmist... though not entirely invalid. And again, this is changeable. Market forces are shifting this.4. Arguable at best.None of this list looks at the detrimental effects of shifting to an entirely plant based diet (presumably this meat substitute will require plants).I want to address another point you made about healthy and ethical meat being too expensive. We eat too much as it is, do we not? No one would starve. That argument is a bad one because people do not need as much meat as they eat.The left loves to restrict foods people eat for the purpose of health. They impose taxes on things like soda (which is silly, but whatever) to price the bad behavior out of the reach of people so as to reduce that behavior. We eat too much, pricing a fair market value on healthier, grass fed, humane meat will reduce the amount we eat and force people to do more with less. By leftist logic, this would be a good thing. The thing is, it would require leftists to put their money where their mouths are and start deciding to make the choices that shift the market in that direction.Also, on that note, smaller more ethical farms that do not use hormones and antibiotics, if supported, will expand and develop more efficient means to ethically scale up in a sustainable ways. In other words, if we support good farms they will expand and we will have more healthy food for a cheaper price. We know this will happen because it is already happening.Also, we need animals to sustain soils anyway. They are by far more efficient at fertilizing and keeping rich soil than fertilizers. In fact, lands that have been stripped of all their nutrients have been bought up by sustainable, ethical farmers, and they are using chickens and livestock to replenish the soil. This cannot be done with traditional fertilizers nearly as efficiently and as richly as animals can do it. When that farm replenishes the soil, they will use animals in tandem with their farming to keep soils fertile, rather than doing traditional crop rotation that depletes soils badly, just a little slower than those pre-dustbowl strategies.Industry is doing amazing things, and much of it is even being done by left leaning entrepreneurs/farmers and achieving some amazing things while the left at large doesn't recognize their achievements.I implore you to look at the positives that are happening, because there are many. There was a report on your comment that said "if they think they're untouchable then why are they resigning?"To that user I say: Umm, because they got caught. They thought they were untouchable when they were doing all that crap. This is not hard. If you're going to troll with the report button, at least be smart about it. Actually it is definable (typo). I won't go into it in detail but the rhetoric against the meat industry is weak at best. Certainly factory farming in the way many larger companies do it have some real effects on the local environment but the worry about methane is grossly overstated. I think a greater concern is septic issues from animal waste, but that can be easily mitigated. If killing animals is the issue, crop planting, maintenance, and harvesting kill tons of animals. People don't think about this which makes the idea of an entirely vegetable based diet for all fir the sake of the environment go unchecked in so many minds... these are not the only arguments by a long shot. Just a couple to wet the beaks of the uninitiated (typo), so to speak. Im going to have to disagree with you on that. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/massive-study-finds-no-single-genetic-cause-of-same-sex-sexual-behavior/Homosexuality is largely learned. I'm not saying there aren't other factors that are uncontrollable by a person who pursues same sex relationships, but they seem more in line with disorder than with anything else. And frankly, some homosexual behavior is entirely learned. Some of it is caused by sexual abuse early on (certainly not all of it by a long shot, but some) just like promiscuity in women is often linked to abuse. Some of it is caused just by seduction, some by curiosity, etc. This is not an extensive list by any means, just some examples of things that can lead to same sex experimentation. And one you try it and you realize it feels good (because it's sex), then the endorphin response will largely drive the behavior. Not for someone who uses that question as a logical fallacy. I think you have to logically prove eating real meat is unethical first. But this is interesting. EDIT: Up front I just want people to know that this comment is not intended to make all or even most of the people who think one way as wholly better or worse, or more sane or less sane than the other. What these studies show are higher rates of these behaviors. The rates are significant, but that doesn't mean that most democrats are neurotic when I say a study shows liberals have a higher rate of neurotic behavior. It's kinda like when you look at a study that says Omeprezol increases your likelihood of kidney disease by like 20%... that is true, but the real number is more like this: The average rate of kidney disease is (I'm making this up for easier math) 5%. The average rate of kidney disease among regular users of omeprezol is 6%... which is an increase of 20%, but still your overall risk of kidney disease didn't change very much at all. The numbers are significant, but put into a better context this way. In the same way, the studies I will refer to (though I do not cite, I have in the past and written extensively on it in the past, so maybe I'll find the link sometime) speak to these kinds of differences. So saying that Democrats are more neurotic than republicans is not saying they are all insane Woody Allen types (though that's hilarious). It is saying that if the average rate of neurosis is like 5% across the entire US, then democrats might have a rate of 7% while Republicans have a rate of 3%. If I say Democrats have a lower rate of giving to charity, it is not saying that they are all cheap bastards by a long shot... but it might mean that (and I would have to find the numbers again) that the average charity rate is 5% of income, democrats might only give 2% Republicans might give 8% (the discrepancy for that rate was higher). My point here is that individually there are amazing Democrats and amazing Republicans. When you have a slightly higher neuroticism rate on average, that can amount to quite a lot of wild behavior. Imagine a stadium of 10,000 people, say only 1% are batshit crazy... that's still 100 people wreaking havoc. But on a massive, nationwide scale, the rates are different and have some explanatory power over some of the behavior we see that differs across the political aisle.... sorry that was a long caveat/edit, now onto my original comment. Every study I see about liberals and conservatives point to liberals having higher rates of neuroses, higher rates of divorce, lower rates of giving charity,  and lower rates of consuming media from multiple outlets. There was one study that said they are smarter on average, and they are obviously more educated. The thing is that smarter people are more prone to believing lies because they can craft narratives to fill in the wholes then the veneer of the low comes off. Smarter people are actually easier to lie to in general, and they maintain that lie in their heads.Also, they act like being more educated makes you smarter and more informed, yet you go to a college campus and none of them know the bill of rights hardly at all. They are indoctrinated there with all kinds of tripe and they act like they've been freed from the shackles of their public educations, which have a left bent as well. So many are very deluded about reality, like fundamental reality, which is disturbing. Actually, scholars and archeologists rely on it to find ancient cities. It has been very reliable for geographic and historic events. Obviously, it is hard to corroborate the miraculous claims which is probably your main criticism. But that criticism only extends that far.  But it's historical accuracy keeps being corroborated like when certain wars were fought, when cities were taken over and by whom. Even atheist scholars use it and rely on it for information. That and the proliferation of pornography is leading people to think that whatever fantasy they want, they should pursue and have. This leads to really dumb behaviors. You would think that the people wouldn't vote for people who clearly pursue these endeavors, but they see most of this as a social justice issue.She is openly bisexual, and married if I am not mistaken. I think most bisexuality is really just a fetish and a result of pornography and media that inserts more and more sex. So these fantasies kind of infect us and then we entertain these fleeting fantasies enough that they become full blown desires. Then it's just a matter of poking around to test the waters and see if they can make their fantasy real. So when someone says they are bisexual I tend to think they are just foolishly admitting a fetish to everyone openly. And this kind of proves that. She is not pursuing love and romance, she is pursuing sexual gratification.What disturbing is that people think she is just a marginalized person, bullied because she is "bisexual". So they vote this into office. In the past, powerful people kept this behavior hidden. Now they are wearing it with pride but being dishonest about the nature of their sexual pursuits.There are some marriages that can make it and include partners who accept an open relationship or the inclusion of a third party (or more). But I tend to think those people are deluding themselves. They certainly dont provide a good foundation for their kids.Imagine being a teenager and realizing your parents pursue this stuff. What gives a kid more confidence? The knowledge their parents came together for love and specifically to have children? Or wondering if you were a result of a fling that was pursued solely for sexual fulfillment? This is a fair assessment. But I think the other user still has a point. Irresponsibly using the land makes forests smaller and makes the first more dangerous to property that abuts the forest. By not having buffers and by just boxing nature into smaller and smaller areas, the results of fires that would have been more naturally controlled become worse simply because some homes and farms are at risk. So fire abatement has to happen, which leads to these forests that develop as you mentioned.This is obviously not just a California problem,  it it is exacerbated in California due to it's climate. So irresponsible farming there is worse than a lot of places. And considering how much farming goes on there, and how much land is used for farming, and how frequently wildfires happen there, bad choices are amplified.So while the specifics the user mentioned may not be even close to the whole story, their overall point remains. For a state that attempts to lead the country and world in various green initiatives, you'd think they might say no to avacado farms or at least see the connections between all these factors and attempt to mitigate the problems. I don't really get the draw either. I like avacado, I even like avacado on toast or a bagel, but I'm not going to pay for it at a restaurant and making it at home is kind of a pain in the ass unless you have those little vacuusealed avacado containers... and these are the people who begrudge those who use more packaging then they feel they should. And avacado is the kind of thing that you would have to package in individual containers for toast because it turns brown and gross if you dont use it all. We need to do a better job of highlighting how competition can happen in industries that have long held regional monopolies due to high barriers to entry. They have some cognitive dissonance about this even when they see competition amongst internet providers expanding in their own communities after thinking competition could never happen. Dont be deceptive. The fact they put it in the obituary section is insulting on its own, and that shows their double standard even more clearly than just the title. Terrorists do not deserve the respect of an obituary. They might as well have thrown him a lavish funeral and had Obama eulogize him. I still think the past tense of "text" sounds stranger: texted. It sounds like the "ed" is superfluous to me. I would liken it to "bet" or "cut" which have a present tense "he bets" and "he cuts" but the past tense is "he bet" and "he cut". "Texted" sounded like when a little kid or a yokel says "he betted on it!" or something. So instead of "he texted me last night" I would have it "he text me last night". Fortunately this is just indoctrination by an idiot teacher. The systemic indoctrination is a bit more troubling to me. You should focus on your studies so you don't get detention again. You sure take criticism personally. There is cognitive dissonance on the left there is some on the right, too. In this case, the left's is relevant.But you are not mature enough for that level of discourse. You didnt make a point. You dismissed a point through dishonest means. Good job. So instead if addressing an argument you dont like, you poison the well against who you perceive as your opponent. This is typical fascist strategy. Good job. I think you might just see this because of some cognitive dissonance that is created by media in virtually all spheres being dominated by the left. So any tick towards the right looks extreme to you. FOX was the challenger to an ever leftward creeping media. People want to believe it is establishment, but it isn't. It is established now, but the establishment remains left leaning. I'm not begrudging that, it's just reality. So when a right leaning outlet gains some steam, the perception by the left is that the right is taking over. But the reality that the media is correcting course a bit towards the middle.And this comparison to China is rather silly. This left right paradigm needs to stop, China is communist, that is left, but somehow that is right in your argument here. I dont really care how you put it because the paradigm is messed up, the paradigm shouldn't be left and right. It should be up and down and based entirely on the level of control of government.Instead of a left/right spectrum it should look like sky scraper that is rather thin at the base and blooms out a bit the higher you go. At the bottom point is complete anarchy. It is stable only because it is not really designed to be stable... it does what it is designed to do, which is nothing. You can't really destroy an anarchy, you can only bring order to it. The higher you go in this model, the harder the crash is when the government fails. Also, when you get high enough the more weight it exerts on the bottom.Just a little higher than anarchy would be your various brands of libertarianism, Jeffersonian liberalism, anarcho-capitalism, etc. A little higher would be conservatism. A little higher would be modern liberalism and federalism. You see, as we go higher there is more government and more control of individuals and more weight on those at the bottom. Then you get up to democratic monarchies, parliamentary monarchies, limited monarchies. Then up towards the very top would be dictatorships, communist regimes and fascist regimes. At that level of control there is very little reason to distinguish between ideologies because the level of control hurts all the people and the destruction it causes when it falls is massive. Obviously, the distinction between communist regimes and fascist ones is valid in many discussions, but the result is pretty mich the same... death and destruction.This clears up many of the rather silly arguments. Jeffersonian liberalism and conservatism, which make up sort of the majority of the left and the right respectively, were primarily positions that are lower down in this new model. Neither wished for much government intervention. That started to change when racist policies accepted by pretty much everyone started to rightfully be challenged. That is when the call for the federal government to intervene became something people started to call for a lot more. The left kinda started taking that and running with it though. They sort of shifted from the Jeffersonian liberals states' rights supporters to a bit more of the federalist kind of bent. So they kinda creeped up that sky scraper over the last 60 years or so, really since just after things settled from WWII.Let's forget about the racism rampant un the democratic party around that time and earlier and let's not worry about the debated stories about this perceived shift in racism and let's look just at government control. Conservatives stayed pretty solidly in the very limited government control camp (particularly federal), and again, the liberals creeped up a little higher. I'm not saying either is right or wrong. My point is simply the paradigm should be about control or lack thereof. This paradigm of left and right plays us as enemies against each other which leaves those who wish for power to push things higher and higher up that sky scraper, eventually leading to an oppressive regime. You realize that proof is required for such allegations, right? I love how people take a Rage-Against-the-Machine level extremely cynical stance and say that because a person exists and has any power that they are corrupt to the core. You don't understand human nature nor how corruption works if you think this way.If you say someone is corrupt to the core, you need evidence. Prove it. You can find evidence of some not so moral behavior. Is that proof of constant corruption? Is that proof of the specific corruption you want to accuse Trump of? No. If you have specific evidence you can corroborate of a crime that isn't just the hearsay of some dude who claims he heard a conversation, then show us.If the world worked your way then any accusation at all would mean a person is evil. I could sling an accusation at you, and magically you are now corrupt to the core. Even if my accusation was a lie, all I have to do would be "look, this guy posts on porn subreddits." And because that is not all that moral of a behavior, by your logic, I have proven you are corrupt to the core.Good job, you have stood up for the same behavior that led to the Salem Witch Trials. I undersrand that you think these things and assert them with a condescending tone to feel superior. But the truth is that the evidence is all very weak, second hand stuff from people tied to politicians who want Trump out. You are trusting as gospel the testimony of a person who was not privy to the conversations over the actual conversations.And you're being a dick about it.Take care. Again, you are twisting the argument dishonestly. You are saying those red flag laws are bad, and they might be, but you are using those as the archetype of all possible red flag laws and that no red flag law could even possibly be reasonable before you even hear a conversation about them.Dismissal before thorough examination is foolish. That is what you are doing and you seem to be doing this intentionally because you seem to also be smarter than the stance you are taking. A stance that involves having a conversation. But you are not even willing because you think this is black and white, presumably for fear of a red flag sort(edit) of law being abused. But that is blinding you from even hearing arguments and saying there can't actually be an argument. You arrogantly seem to know all the arguments and all the theoretical laws that might be(edit) proposed because you know there can't possibly be one that is valid.This is why a conversation with you is not fruitful. Take care. That is not an intellectually honest stance. You again are assuming the result of the conversation is something that would be unconstitutional or a violation. No, I am using a single example as a sign that there are many examples that validate the discussion of a possible red flag law. You are claiming I am attempting to do something I am not when you say I am trying to justify a law. I am simply justifying the discussion of a possible legislative solution to a problem that exists. I am not stating whether I would support such a law or that such a law could adequately solve the problem without infringing on the second amendment in a way that would render the law unconstitutional.I am simply saying there are valid grounds for a discussion. You are saying there is not and then getting ahead of yourself by acting as if I have pushed about three steps beyond what I said to the point that you have me voting "Yea" on a bill I haven't even partially drafted yet. Neither of those scenarios is illegal not are they hypocritical. This article is attempting to make this out to be a hypocritical move so let's play this out.First, let's assume (and I kinda wander off a but here) that the Ukraine discussion was entirely legal, which I argue it was, but let's assume. So we would assume that the funds specifically for the Ukraine were withheld for the sake of making sure they would do the right thing with the funds. The general narrative here fits with the narrative and rhetoric the president and this administration has been saying since his campaign: that the we give too much money to people who are not pulling their own weight and are not using the funds we give them well. So my narrative for the Ukraine scandal (or model, or assumption, or rationale, or however you want to put it) fits *exactly* with what they have been saying they want to do all along. Whether you assume the Ukraine scandal was legal or not, the narrative that it was legal fits with all the previous evidence... that doesn't mean it couldn't have been illegal, but if it was illegal, there is an extra layer you would have to fit into your narrative that shows he did this intentionally and truly as a means to win the next election rather than to simply fight corruption. This becomes complicated because if you have a political opponent who is corrupt, are you not supposed to investigate them? Obama investigated Trump (rather illegally I would argue) but if Trump were truly corrupt, would the fact he was the main political opponent to Clinton matter? So long as we wait until the evidence is all gathered quietly so as not to unduly destroy a campaign, an investigation is not necessarily wrong to do. What is troubling about Obama is that he actually seemed to use his office to spy on Trump rather than simply ask someone to look into it.So if the Ukraine scandal was perfectly legal (though admittedly not smart) then what is the hypocrisy this article is pointing out? For one country (the Ukraine) they gave funds, presumably because they felt the corruption funds would be used well. For others, they cut funding because they felt we were spending too much. How is that hypocritical? How is that a scandal?I imagine (though frankly don't recall) that some of those countries on the list getting funds to fight corruption are countries like Iran or some other countries with clearly questionable leadership. But why would those countries get money and not Ukraine? Might it have anything to do with the fact that Russia just recently re-encroached on the Ukraine and took part of their land? Might it have to do with the fact the the US would and should be interested in fighting corruption in the Ukraine that would give Russia a lot of power within the Ukrainian government? Might giving the funds to the Ukraine be more reasonable than some other countries simply due to the constant threat of Russia?Again, where is the hypocrisy here? Where is the issue here?Now if Trump really did act illegal, then a whole lot of other questions will arise and should be investigated fully. And I'm glad it is being investigated now. But what is alarming to me is the way leaks keep coming out that make the people angry before they even know all the facts.Right now there are "impeachment proceedings" happening and .ost of the left seems to think these are official proceedings. But they have not called that vote yet, these are informal hearings that the president and the administration has no legal obligation to cooperate with. When it becomes official then the president would have that legal obligation. But most of the left doesnt seem to realize this fact. They are knowingly playing the people and making them think Trump is doing more illegal stuff by not cooperating. That simply isn't true.So that is why this title is utterly dishonest (plus some extra rambling I did).If you assume that Trump did act illegally in the Ukraine call scandal, then you would think there would be some mind of smoking gun evidence by now, but so far every whistleblower has come forward with less information that was second hand information than the first hand information we saw in the memcon. Perhaps though the investigation has something stronger and just haven't yet released it. Perhaps they think they are onto something. So there might be reason for why this hasn't become a formal impeachment hearing, but it looks a lot like more of a witch hunt, more an an excuse to pry and find anything that will stick.While much of the rhetoric that has been said by Trump and his administration and his lawyer have not sounded good at all, nothing illegal has actually happened and yet the left acts like they keep admitting guilt. It's like the pussu grabbing incident. What Trump described was not assault, it was not moral, it was not classy, but it was not assault and more specifically it was not an admission to a crime. If some model claimed Trump grabbed her pussy at X club at Y time, and then Trump said "yeah, that model just let me grab her by the pussy" then suddenly you have a specific incident to investigate that may or may not be a crime. It's still her word against his, so finding that illegal would be difficult. But the point is that the president would have been in a hell of a lot more trouble because there would actually be something to investigate. Likewise, everything that has been said has not been an admission of anything illegal but here we have a specific that can be investigated. That is the difference. So far nothing has panned out.It could. It's possible Trump is corrupt and used his power illegally and if that can be proven I will certainly support impeachment, but right now it is still a nothing burger, but people keep thing that these straws that the media keep grasping at are damning pieces of evidence. They aren't. Hmm, it's nice to see you folks continue to lie about our arguments.Just a point, it was not illegal to hold those funds. You seem to think each part of the story is illegal when you need the whole narrative to fit and actually show us a quid pro quo including an illegal use of presidential authority in exchange for something of value.What actually happened is that a deal was struck which was entirely based on the idea that the country receiving the funds would not do bad things with it. This is like making sure your kid is going to do the right thing with the money you gave them to go shopping for new pants. If you are not sure they will do the right thing, you withhold the money until you are more confident they will.That is not illegal, that is ensuring as much as possible that the country you are trying to help won't just go run off with the money and not do what they said.You'll notice I dont say you are lying about your own stance (as you claim I have done) but I do claim you lie about our stance, because you did. I also didnt stoop to ad hominem attacks nor did I assume I'll intent as you have done.You are ruining the discourse with this baseless mischaracterization of opinions you dont like and baseless attacks on the character of the people presenting them.This behavior is what made Trump. Good job. You seem to be confusing narratives. Paying to fight corruption and paying for NATO and the UN are different things. What? So an at risk kid should be looking up guns and accessories in school? This is another incredibly dishonest measure of the position of people you apparently don't talk to. It's nice to see people so blatantly mischaracterize the arguments of those they disagree with. Your comment is dishonest.It is also nice to see an apparent misunderstanding of how things work.If you have a classroom full of students who are misbehaving constantly, you might come up with a plan to help them manage their own behavior, like rewarding them with something they want... maybe you offer a get out of homework coupon, maybe it's candy. So you implement your plan with the hope that the students will now proactively moderate their own behavior.It turns out that they don't really moderate their behavior, they do the same things except maybe they adapt them to the new situation. Maybe they sell your candy. Maybe they work together to appear like they are behaving to get the candy, then you find out they were just screwing around in a less obvious way. Maybe they forge your homework coupons.So you find out all the time and money you spent on your anti-class-misbehavior campaign was wasted. So you inform the class that it is over and you are removing the rewards and returning to harsher penalties. Basically you start doing what you should have done from the start which is give them nothing but exactly what is owed, being a good teacher, and then passing out detentions or referring the particularly poorly behaved kids to administration.It turns out that when you want to help people, you might try to help in many ways that don't work. You might try to help them ward off corruption by giving them money to spend on some kind of law enforcement initiative. When it doesnt work and you stop that method, that doesnt make you bad, they started with no help, they can go back to no help. Sometimes not receiving help forces people to face their problems head on and actually fix them, sometimes help just prolongs the problem or allows.We should not be funding anti-corruption efforts that are just ending up as a cash grab for those corrupt people. You guys act like this action is hypocritical.Trump tried to make sure Ukraine was on the up and up before releasing the funds, and now they are slashing money from more corruption efforts. What is hypocritical about that? Nothing.If he pulled a reall quid pro quo then he should have to answer for it. But so far you folks just keep clinging to these narratives and even spinning the narrative into something it is not. I don't think this is fair.I'm deeply concerned with the pushes to destroy the 2nd amendment,  but I have seen many situations play out in which a red flag law could be very beneficial.Imagine a young person of 15-16 years old who has deep emotional issues and some violent thoughts, the kind of person who might become a school shooter. Imagine also the kinda of parents who generally raise these kinds of kids. They usually don't have all their shit together, they may be really sweet people and mean well, but are struggling with raising their children correctly... this might be for many reasons, maybe it's just the mental illness of this son of theirs that is putting a strain on things, maybe the mother is really selfish and just suddenly leaves to stay with her mom 4 states away (all these hypotheticals I have seen in real life, some of which may have happened all in one family). There  are often multiple significant weaknesses in these families and then a ton of smaller weaknesses.Now imagine that family is a gun owning family and that this appears to be one of the things the father gets right because he takes the safety very seriously, locks the guns away in very secure locations, and keeps the keys on his person at all times.The son goes on a downward spiral mentally, at school he gets in trouble because he used a school computer to look up high capacity ammo clips. He starts acting strange, even for him in school and says something to a friend about wanting to shoot up the school.If the parents are on top of things, everything should be fine, right? Save and secure guns are still safe and secure even if a kid is mentally disturbed, right? Kinda.... the kid probably knows where the keys are kept though, he is probably not supervised every second of the day at home. And if he has explored reddit even a little bit, it is not beyond reason to think he might know that there are tutorials on how to break into locks, perhaps even the locks his father uses to secure all their guns.Now, I am not saying I know what the rule should be about when exactly it is appropriate, nor how much specific evidence is necessary, but a red flag law that secured the weapons away from that home temporarily until the son gets the appropriate treatment or is found not to be a legitimate threat I think should be on the table.I'm not saying I know that there are reasonable measures to take in all cases, but I think it is possible to talk things out at the very least, and perhaps even come up with some feasible rules that do not run us the risk of easily violating 2a for law abiding citizens. There's a difference between a single person looking at bad parenting that contributes to emotional problems and a large group of people who think all of society's problems were caused by previous generations.Parents directly affect their kids. But millennials do seem to blame their parents for all the problems that slavery caused even though that generation had nothing to do with causing slavery. I'm sure Bill would understand that he knows his parents probably didnt learn how to parent well (I think it's even part of one of his bits) and so he doesn't put all the fault on his parents but does say that their parenting directly affected him. My guess is this is a black market organ deal. The goods just died before they could be harvested.We already know China pulls this shit. It would not be surprising if they ship them out to high paying elite types all over the world. The border patrol agents think it will help and I trust them over you. Exactly. The top comment here kinda proved (edit: past tense because the comment was removed) this point. People are dismissing this because it isn't an "expert" in the exact field of study and yet the person has 20 years experience in education which means they see these things play out in real time and interact with real students and observe real home lives and their effects on students. This makes them an expert in education and how students behave. Plus this person has the educational background to know how to read, interpret, and even critique scientific studies. But because she isn't specifically a child psychologist or something, they act like it is bunk.I see first year teachers who come in thinking they know everything and they dont make it because they haven't seen reality, they have only seen what professors and academics have told them, many of whom didnt last as teachers and so never really gained the experiential knowledge, but started talking as if they know how to fix classrooms. That's not to say they dont have any good ideas, but it certainly shows they haven't been on the front lines. A credibility issue? I see what you are saying but one of the foundations of understanding is being undermined with this kind of waving off of observation and experience.EDIT: for clarification, the user says because the author has not recieved a degree in the specific field of something like child or teen psychology (or another are of study perfectly relevant to the concepts covered) that this person is not credible. This person has 20 years experience teaching so has seen how parents, home lives, student wellness, and academics interact on a very intimate level (more so than most social scientists who study this stuff with surveys and such). The person also has enough education to have learned about how to read scientific studies, how to critique them, how to interpret them, and how to find their strengths and weaknesses. So they are educated enough to look at the data and studies of other researchers, compare it to her 20 years of experience, and craft a narrative that is both valid and insightful. But because the person did not specifically go I to education science or developmental psych, the user thinks they lack credibility. END EDIT.It is the reasoning and the data you should look at, first, not the credentials. Credentials should clearly be considered but reason and truth trump all of that.People do not understand what data is and only define it narrowly. This happens all the time and leads to misunderstanding and it actually slows down knowledge. For instance, once I had a conversation with someone on reddit in which the idea of externalities came up. That person was only using it within the context of the market, but the idea can and is applied all over. Many actions within a large system will have externalities, or things that happen outside the focus of what you wanted to happen. It's really just a fancy word fo "consequences". The user couldn't seem to understand this and so they steered the conversation so that it only circled around the financial term. This completely destroyed the conversation."Data" is another such term. So is "evidence". There are legal definitions of evidence and there are other definitions for evidence. Data can be evidence. Eye witness testimony is evidence (in the form of testimony). Evidence can be valid, it can be invalid, it can be partially valid. Evidence exists just as it is and appears and then we use it to try and piece together what happened or what something means. Take O. J. Simpson's famous glove. That was evidence. Whether it was evidence that he murdered his wife and her lover or if it was just evidence that the killer did it was not determined, but it was evidence. The question about evidence is "what does this evidence point towards? And does it do it clearly enough to prove or to at least give us a good guess as to what happened?" This is why evidence is always tied to something specific. Virtually everything is evidence of something. The chair you might be sitting on is evidence that we have learned to craft chairs easily. It might be evidence of mass production. It might be evidence of skillful wood carving.As human beings who must make sense of the world, we also have to look at evidence and create a hierarchy for it. So when it comes to science, hard data evidence is held above anecdotal evidence. Repeatable experiments are better evidence than a one off study. Documented surveys are better than informal surveys.In the same way, data has varying degrees of confidence. Anecdotes are data, but they are generally not quantitative and are rather qualitative data. But anecdotal evidence can become quantitative evidence. Take UFOs. All of that evidence is anecdotal until you start looking at the numbers. How many anecdotes were there? How many are easily debunkable? How many are not so easy to explain? That is harder data. Is it specific? Does it prove anything? No, but it points to a possibility that is more likely than just a crack pot theory.Belittling a point because of the credentials not being specific to the realm of thought you think it should be specific to is not a valid reason to dismiss evidence. And what is worse about this flippant manner of disregarding this is that most teachers will tell you the same thing. Most teachers, even those who have only been working a couple years will tell you that what they observe is that students who have the most trouble with behavior, with academics, and socially or far more likely to come from a one parent home.And we know, based on basic human psychology and sociology, that many behaviors, such as how you treat friends, how you treat romantic partners, how you manage your time, how you budget your money, etc. are all largely learned. Where is it learned from? Primarily from parents. What happens when one parent isn't there? There is a gap in the teaching that typically happens that a single parent must fill in.Sometimes that gap is filled in well, sometimes it isn't but the kid learns from other people, sometimes a two parent household is toxic and there is a massive gap in learning because both parents suck, sometimes both parents are great but there is some other kind of issue that stood in the way.The point is not that every one parent household is bad, or even that most are bad. The point is showing the risks of that choice or of that circumstance that perhaps was not a choice. It also shows the risk of putting yourself in a position where you might end up as a single parent. Meaning that if you get married for stupid reasons or you have sex before you are married and weren't actually ready for that kind of commitment, then you are putting yourself at a greater risk of becoming a single parent which then puts your kid more at risk for all those problems that correlate to single parent homes.This is all observable. It's all evident. And yet people like you think that if there is not a study that says exactly what this person concluded, then it is invalid. But by doing that you ignore years of observation by thousands (probably hundreds of thousands) of teachers that repeatedly show that single parent homes correlate to issues. There are also plenty of studies that show exactly what this article says. What studies do is find the correlations and then observation tends to find the why's. This is an entirely valid reasoning.This flippant dismissal of content on such superficial and faulty reasoning is not good hard data is great, experts are great, experts talking about hard data is great. But anecdotes and experience are great, too. There was one instance that I know of that the left globe onto and painted it as if it was happening all over the country. It was at this Westboro Baptist like church and it was the same dude who burned the Koran that made the news a few years back.So there was a picture of an effigy of Obama and then the burning of that effigy both from the same church. And them maybe a couple more.Fast forward to just after the 2016 election and massive protests and riots all over the country occur where people are beating, stoning, urinating on, and burning effigies of the Trump."Blame the enemy for exactly what you are doing" is their strategy. Your father is not smart because her (typo) policies are all solidly leftist. Frankly, I think you made this up. While Republicans have praised her standing up to liars like Harris and for encouraging bipartisanship and working as a team rather than enemies, Republicans not a fan of her policies at all. So either your dad votes for very superficial reasons (in which case his opinion is worthless and shouldn't be used in an argument), or he is incredibly misinformed about her policies, or you are misrepresenting (on purpose or not) your father's views.It is amazing how much support the OP has gotten here. Gabbard's policies are straight leftist, she is not that different drun the others except that she is unwilling to act like Republicans are enemies, because they aren't. This is stupid. You are acting like no one should work with Republicans on anything and that others don't work with them on anything.Be honest. I think her policies suck because they are largely exactly what the left wants, but she is one of the few with integrity in the sad cast of idiots running for the Democrat ticket. You seem to confuse genocide with what killed 90% of the natives, which was just disease they had not been exposed to until the Europeans came over.There was some bad stuff that happened, sure. But a systematic extermination? You know systematic has meaning, right? It's not just something you throw in front of a word for emphasis. Any Europeans coming over would have killed about the same number of Natives. 90% of their population died due to disease that had not hit them yet that came from plain old contact with the Europeans. Stop acting like it was  genocide. Right, because that is an honest retelling of our view. This is why I thought AOC was supported, too. She certainly has more integrity than the rest of them. The industrial revolution and WWII were things that happened to the US not BY the US. And you are right, we adapted to it and then thrived.Changing laws just because is not adapting, it is giving power to those who wish to take it. It is making the people an endangered species and making a few very powerful people the apex predators with no one to challenge them.You want to take an ecosystem and make an animal rather high up the food chain even more powerful by limiting the adaptability of those lower on the food chain. And you THINK you are giving those lower on the food chain more adaptability but in truth you are severely limiting them.Take care. You are arguing dishonestly. I said clearly there are laws we have in place and others that perhaps should be in place to curb pollution. You are dishonestly making my argument out to be something it is not.You have also disregarded many valid arguments because... well for no reason other than it isn't what you have heard before. Are you in high school? I hope you are in high school.You are not a reasonable person, and your behavior here proves it.Take care. So because my argument is well reasoned, it is bad...?This is anti-intellectual, overly cynical bullshit. People get on board with things that are better for them but they are also willing to get on board things that are not as good for them but work to the greater good.The trick is to not force any of it unless absolutely necessary.For example, you mention cups not being thrown away. Moderating human behavior is certainly difficult and waste like that is a valid concern.Your view would call for something drastic, like to pass a law banning such products. But that doesnt fix the problem at all. The only problems it fixes are problems that we already have solutions for. Most plastic bag garbage that is left in communities is unsightly and bad for the environment, except there are both municipal and volunteer solutions to this. There are street cleaners and litter collectors who work for a living, do it as volunteer work, even prisoners collect trash from time to time.Now you may be saying, "OK you fucking asshole who is lying to us with reasoning! What about the trash that gets into the oceans and lakes and rivers or seeps into soils, huh? Can you clean up crews suck plastic out of the water?" First, why the hostility? Second, it is unfortunate that behaviors of people in industry have led to chemicals and garbage being dumped into places that are very difficult to clean. We have laws in place to prevent these things and civil suits that arise that make it very costly to make mistakes or to purposefully damage the environment. As for that stuff that is there now and the things that are out of our control, banning plastic bags in the US will do nothing to China, who is responsible for the giant garbage island in the ocean. Using those more sturdy bags that supermarkets have now really do not help much at all except perhaps with the unsightliness I mentioned before. The net effect on the environment is still about the same because of the amount of plastic that goes into those bags does little to negate what just using one-time-use bags does to the environment.Banning plastic straws does almost nothing in the same way and paper straws suck, aren't recyclable, and are shipped in plastic anyways.Have you not heard of landfill reclamation? Because modern landfills work in a way that they seal layers of them, pump water into them, and the biomass within them decays and producers natural gas in large enough quantities to feasibly sell or to power your landfill. After all that material is broken down, you can (and people do) excavate the landfills for usable material, like metals and large plastics that can be recycled.The remaining material has a much smaller volume, and if processed could feasibly be used for fuel, or another option is utilizing plastic eating bacteria and algae to break down the material into stuff that might one day fertilize our soils.So you have two options here, you ban ban everything and tax the hell out of carbon which doesn't slave anything and might actually make it more difficult for a landfill to start a reclamation project. Or you can look to the future and get out of the way of people who can actually help.Instead of taxing carbon output, treat it as a natural resource (because it is one) and sell your carbon emissions to indoor farms which will yield better crops. This, by the way, is already done in some places where it was cost effective.So stop acting like it is all doom and gloom. Greta is wrong, alarmists are wrong. We have work to do, but stop acting like we will all die because of this. The future is bright if people stop freaking out all the time. Most of your argument is specious at best.Like your last comment, and I paraphrase "at least they are trying to build something up and not tear them down." Who is trying to tear anything down, we all want to preserve what is good and make better what is worse. This way of thinking demonizes people who you would be able to compromise with if you didnt make them out to be monsters.Secondly, building something is not always a good thing. Greta touches on something here that the American Right has been saying for sometime now, that these carbon taxes are silly. They are a hotbed of corruption, it is a massive pile of money that can just skimmed off the top for all kinds of things you don't want or that we shouldn't pay for but do because that money just sits there. Also, Nazi's tried to build something, Stalin tried to build something, child pornographers tried to build something, Jeffrey Epstein tried to build something. Building something does not make it good, and preventing something from being built is not inherently bad.Third, if your argument is that "at least something is being tried by one side, while the other side is doing nothing". Then you are misrepresenting the other side and, again, wrongfully demonizing them and dehumanizing them. The general criticism is against the right and against major industry (which everyone these days assumes is all right leaning folks but that isn't true). If the only action you can think of is government involvement then you become blind to the many other things that go on, like charitable organizations that work to restore ecosystems or seek out options for carbon capture, and so on. It also ignores the steps private industry has taken, dont like factory farms? Me neither, and I choose to buy better options as much as I can and support those companies which are growing and popping up all over.Those are valid and substantive attempts to mitigate these issues. But because they do not include massive government involvement, many don't seem to see it. I mean there was just a story on r/technology about how desalination plant technology has just been made that takes 90% less energy than the current desalination efforts.That means one of the major worries about our climate future, fresh water, will not be a problem. And this tech is already employed in places like Israel and California, last I checked, was looking into using it.Greta and her parents and the adults parading her around are not informing her about these kinds of things and so her message is nothing but doom, gloom, and vague threats against the people she thinks aren't doing enough.EDIT: typos Okie dokie. Is it? Have you talked with them? Because a lot of people support people to be able do what they want with their bodies but are arguing that parents putting their kids on hormones or hormone blockers is disgusting and abusive. Normalizing that kind of behavior is terrible.But if you assume that stance is just a bigoted stance against all LGBTQ people, then you get what you think this is.Again, you can't pull things out of their context and just demonize them, listen to their stance. I have heard plenty of participants say they just think pride parades are foolish, because they are. Look, I hate Beto. I think he is a coward with terrible policies. And if things came to a point where they confiscated guns, yeah, there would probably be a civil war.But what first would happen is states and counties and towns and federal government folks would intervene. His plan is clearly unconstitutional. It would clearly be a case of executive overreach and we have mechanisms to deal with that legally.It is certainly alarming how many people think he is right on this. It is also alarming how few Democrats who know he is wrong are saying nothing. They are allowing a really toxic environment to fester. We need leaders to calm some of our people down, we need them to remind our people why we have these freedoms in the first place. Instead they are using and perpetuating that ignorance about why our country ensures these freedoms. It is dangerous but I think we don't need to worry about a civil war for some time. So you show a photo of a dude in a clown outfit and a guy in green face with a sign that says "free kek" and to you that means they are homophobes and that they are marching against homosexuals? Have you talked to people who are in the know about kek and pepe the frog, it seems like you folks took an internet joke and elevated it to nazi propaganda.Also, people have a habit of taking one picture from an event and then making the event out to be something it wasn't. You get some crazy nazi at a tea party rally, someone snaps a photo and spreads it saying "see! Racists!" Except they dont show the video of the crowd calling security and security kicking them out. And those people also ignore all the evidence to the contrary, like all the interviews with people who say things like "we just think it is silly to have a gay pride parade so we are having a straight pride parade to high light that."Nice try though. They weren't anti-gay parades, they were anti-pride-parade parades. Pride parades are stupid. What I don't understand is people who walk their dog in a park, let their dog poop just off the trail, then they bag it but leave the bag. I'd rather you leave the dog pool than seal it in a non-biodegradable bag and force someone else to pick it for you.They are still making someone else clean up their mess, they just made it slightly easier if it does get cleaned up,  but it also pollutes because it often just gets left there. Yep, it's as if people here think only one party does this. This has been going on from the beginning. She also said she was native american. This is one of the things I think so many people miss. Marriage is not about the feeling you get when you fall in love, it is about the commitment. When that word is brought up, people have this strange idea of what it means, that it is a contingent commitment, meaning it is only a commitment until you aren't feeling it anymore. People commit to things and it starts out great and then it gets rough, you start wishing you didn't commit, but you did.There are certainly stories about amicable divorces when the kids are older, but a divorce is hard on adult kids as well. A child who can look back on their parents' relationship and see a solid commitment that never wavered even when their feelings might have is a tremendous foundation for that child. How much more confident can a child be knowing the loves of their lives, their mommy and daddy, are there for each other and for the child?Here's a study that shows that depression rates are worse amongst people whose parents divorced even 15 years after the divorce. Why? In part because the foundation to their life, the guides to this world that chose to bring them into it suddenly split up.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5370459/While an adult child of parents can probably handle it better, the lives of our parents affect us. I see a lot of marital trouble between my parents and it kills me. Even in an amicable divorce, the kids are left wondering, doubting, hoping their parents will get back together. Is that always the case? Perhaps not, but I would argue it's usually the case.Good job sticking it out, I hope you two enjoy old age together. Yeah, I know he isn't necessarily inconsistent in his views here, it's just rather ironic. This is all logically sound. I don't see your problem. I will assume you think I am saying leftism is wrong in that one comment... I do think it is wrong but that is not what I said there, I was merely saying colleges are heavily biased. I would be curious to see where you think it says he spread christianity just as a means of control. Sure, Christianity would have an affect on the natives that would temper their behavior... it turns out the Christians in the middle east are way more chill than the Muslims, too. While a certain value system can have a sort of calming effect on a group of people, you can also think it is better for them.It sounds like some lefty academic types took his wording and made it out to be something it wasn't. Like there might be some comments that refer to the natives in an unkind way and then also talks about how Christianity would help them. And if you read into them with absolute cynicism, then you will assume it was only done for the sake of control. Why spend so much time converting and teaching when you have far superior weapons?And again, I never said he was perfect.I went to college too and I learned that college is like primary and secondary school: you should take what you learn with a grain of salt. Especially considering about 90% of professors lean left or heavily left, they tend to go for the newer trendier views because they are provocative and puts kids in the seats.I'm not here to make a saint out of Columbus. I'm here to get people to calm down with the bullshit. He wasn't Hitler, he wasn't even close, and pinning all those millions of deaths on him is dishonest. Yeah. There are certainly some bad things he did. But he didnt commit genocide and had many good intentions. At least I'm making arguments and not pulling ad hominem attacks with absolutely no substance with which to form an argument. Yeah, libertarians and centrists will tell you this, too. Way to make it political. When you say we, who do you mean and under what circumstances? Just asking because it sounds like you are way oversimplifying history to feed a white guilt narrative.That is not what I said. Stop reading Vox. I never said he was perfect, but he wasn't a genocidal maniac and had good intentions. You are measuring him on current standards that didnt exist back then. When you do that, you might as well say no one should respect what MLK did because he was a womanizer and hit women.You guys seem to think that revering the good of what someone did is also excusing the bad. When you eulogize someone, do you talk about all the bad they did or do you focus on the good.Lastly, he was clearly not a genocidal person. That is a clear lie. You don't get it because this line of reasoning doesn't make sense. Columbus never would have said he was the first human to discover it, he was the first European (and even that is disputed). He was already expecting to find people for trade purposes, he just ran into another continent that Europeans at the time were unaware of. That is a legitimate discovery from their perspective.People are making Columbus out to be a clown, but that isn't true. He wasn't a genocidal maniac either. Finding people was kind of the point. The whole reason he left was to find a new trade route to trade... with people.He discovered an entirely unknown continent *to Europe*, an entirely new land to trade with, and to spread the gospel to. But people have twisted this to mean he claims to be the first human being there. That is not an honest telling of history.By the way, he wasn't genocidal, the vast majority of natives died simply due to the introduction of disease that occurred simply because of the contact they naturally had. [Snall pox and other disease killed 90% of the indigenous population](https://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html) While we weren't entirely ignorant of how disease spread at the time, we certainly had no idea how viruses worked and how immunity to viruses works. So those deaths were not on purpose.That's not a genocide just like the black plague was not a genocide.Further, Columbus wishes to spread Christianity which he believed would help these indigenous people to break out of many more savage practices. That is not the behavior of someone who commits genocide. Hitler didn't say "well, gee. If we just taught them how to help themselves better." Rwandans weren't like "if only those guys knew Christ" and then accidentally killed hundreds of thousands of people. That is not how genocide works.Lastly, there were plenty of warring tribes across the Americas, including those that committed human sacrifice on a massive scale. It's not like all these folks were just peaceful corn farmers. There were peaceful tribes, tribes who wanted to have help from the Europeans against their more formidable enemies, there were warring tribes who attacked them or the tribes the Europeans traded with.Europe didn't just murder the indigenous people like the current popular rewrites of history would have us think. Is this some reverse psychology or something? You know a lot of words are taken up by groups and then the word stops representing what the group is, right? Like Antifa means anti-fascist and yet theybemplou fascist tactics. China calls itself the People's Republic of China, it is hardly a republic and it's not really the people's there, it belongs to the elites. Just because liberals employ a word that means "freedom of mind" or "thought" or however you want to put it, doesn't magically mean they are for freedom of thought. And we see evidence of this with their push for hate speech laws that will fine people hundreds of thousands of dollars for not referring to a person by their preferred pronouns or referring to an illegal immigrant as an illegal immigrant. It sure sounds like they want to restrict thought.Now, real liberals these days exist, and there are some in the Democrat party, but you find more rational libertarians on the right or moving right these days, like Dave Rubin. Yeah, she's pretty good in everything she does. begone troll That is certainly a fair argument. I think selectively doing business with them is okay, but as I was reading story after story about China buying up so much of our debt and gaining control of so many things like running our ports or some other aspect of our infrastructure, I thought that was incredibly boneheaded. It's one thing to order cheap plastic chachkies from a manufacturer there. It's another thing to let one of their companies, which is heavily monitored and controlled by their government, run our highways or ports or bridges. It's one thing for the NBA to cater a bit to them to make some inroads into their markets, but to do so while turning away from free speech ideals (which they don't have to really adhere to as a private business) that make America great is not good.I understand them not wanting our ideals to spread there, I don't want their ideals to spread here either. They don't have media we really want here, but everyone wants our media. So I get their concerns, I do not understand our lack of concern with them spreading their ideals in other ways lack getting footholds in our universities, infrastructure, big business in general, etc.Our media going over there is incredibly beneficial to us and our sphere of influence all over the world. They know Tony Stark is an American and that the films are American made and centered around Western ideals. We can see this right now with Honk Kong protesters being emboldened by South Park they show each other on the streets or using Whinnie the Pooh to mock Xi. So I am partly pleased that we have our media's foot in the door over there even despite their self censoring to be allowed to do so... what is alarming is our lack of understanding how that affects media for us and our perceptions of the world.Like casting a white woman for the role of that monk character in Dr. Strange... that became a big "white washing" issue that the left flipped out about and an annoying injection of a female into the role of a character who was traditionally male in the eyes of the right. Had we simply known they did it to appease China, we all would could have calmed down... the right could still be annoyed it was a chick... but we would all be aligned more appropriately against China and the cowardice of Marvel/Disney/Hollywood. Real treason should be punished harshly. Doing business with a horrible country and kowtowing to their demands is not really treason, it's just shitty and selling out. The Bible teaches that you have to kick people out sometimes, also, it teaches about churches and how to run them, not how to practice government (though there are some great lessons to be learned there). The Bible also teaches about protecting your own and fending for your own before you help others.Stop using this crap because it is dishonest and shows you don't know enough about the Bible to make an informed judgment, you know enough to feel superior and then condescend when you think you cornered a Christian.Take care. Fair enough I think it just has more to do with declines in population which is a result of many factors like taxes, manufacturers moving out, etc.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_County,_New_YorkWe're down about 750K in the county. I would approve this comment if it weren't for the incivility in it because I agree that a video should not just be automatically tossed aside. You don't know what it was regarding. They still lean heavily left. NPR is just a bit less lacking moral character than the MSM. please don't feed the trolls. Just report them. This is a flagrant misreading of scripture. There are judgments passed down for the sake of running a community in the Bible. The idea of forgiveness is absolute, but that does not mean punishments can't be meted out. I think you are a troll who is just looking to start some shit. In the way that the user is a troll and doesn't know what they are talking about. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/02/the-repeated-misleading-claim-that-planned-parenthood-provides-mammograms/ If another company can do it better and cheaper, I'm all for it. But we probably shouldn't let companies from enemy countries do it. Legal and right are not the same thing. All they do is abortion, they push abortion, they don't tell mothers about adopting, they don't tell them about support they can get to raise it on their own... all the push is abortion.Women come thinking they can get mammograms from them because they hear what people like you say and guess what happens? They turn them away because they are not a health clinic. They are technically correct but that is why this is stupid and still wrong. They are legally within their rights to do this as far as I see, and these organizations move monies into different branches of their organizations to do what they will with it.However, if you see a friend down on his or her luck and you offer them some money to help them with rent, then you see them buy a new jacket or something, you would think that is shitty. Now technically, your friend may have put that money you gave them directly to their rent, but you gave the money to them to help them,  not to allow them to be frivolous with money they got elsewhere.I think the person you spoke to on r/politics is using this as a means to justify shitty behavior. While it may not be illegal and while the money from tax payers may technically go into coffer. That money we gave them allows them to do things with other monies that they wouldn't otherwise be able to do.You friend wasn't able to buy that jacket without having that rent money you gave them.It's shitty behavior. Dont let people fool you with the mental gymnastics. This is why it is technically legal and okay, but it is still really shitty. No one is really saying it is misused, but the money given to them by the government allows them to allocate their other funds differently. If they didnt have the tax payer money, they could not be giving as much to Democrats. When the government props them up, they should not be giving money to campaigns in a partisan manner, and should really be avoiding it altogether. A non-profit with money to spend should give it to actual charities or something.This points out that it is a political entity, and not a charity as people on the left make it out to be. Sure, but this idea shouldn't be over applied.In many many ways the US is objectively the best or we stand out towards the head of the pack. Our freedom is top notch and we still have better free speech rules than England, Canada, and all of Europe.Our economy is the strongest our military is the most powerful AND we use it to help many countries. We send so much aid to other countries, we spend so much money on things like NATO and the UN. The EU has largely been able to get away with many of their socialized industries because they haven't had to spend money on a military because we have stepped up to defend them. People here dont seem to realize that these countries spend next to nothing on their military, relying on the US. So they get the false impression that we just haven't figured out how to convince people to socialize medicine.That is like a friend of yours who lives in an apartment and works as like a teacher assistant or something making next to nothing. Except their parents pay their rent. So when they are hanging with friends at a bar and buying top shelf whiskey and always eats out, they don't understand why their friends who actually pay rent are only drinking the beers on special and don't eat out every night.Anyway, my point is that the US is objectively the best in many ways. Our structures were designed for freedom of individuals, it wasn't universally applied for a long time. But the structures were there and were intended to be there from the beginning. We allowed slavery against our better judgment as a means of holding the country together. Had we split up because of that, and as much as we wish everyone would always make perfectly moral choices, sometimes you have to acquiesce to things you do not want to in order to achieve something greater and then fight to make what was wrong into something right.Many founding fathers didnt want slavery. But if the country split up because of that feud, the English might have won, or another power might have taken us over and the imperialistic rule of those nations would have quashed what our government became before it ever became it.So while you certainly just blindly accept that America is the best blindly, you also shouldn't just disregard that idea because every other nation, including really bad ones, tend to think they are the best, and spread propaganda that says so. People take this and swing their opinion so far the other way it's absurd. No country is perfect and there are terrible things in the past of every country. That doesnt discount the good of America, the opportunity that people of all walks of life have here, the wealth that even our poorest enjoy (the poorest here are far better off than the poorest elsewhere),  it doesn't discount the fact that the US pioneered the world in so many amazing technologies, innovations, works of art, and so on.People pick on one thing that may not be ideal and then carry it to it's worst possible conclusion. Atheists didnt have much respect for a long time here, oh no. But they also had the freedom to not believe in anything and be worried the government would kill them for it. That was pretty unique between us and England (but much more so us).So just be careful with this idea. There are certainly awful things in America's past. No one should deny that, but to deny how great America is is just as bad as denying the bad America has done.Many people think conservatives just ignore the bad things. No, we choose to focus on the good and then try to make the bad align with the good. Like a Thomas Jefferson statue... do you tear it down because he owned slaves? Or do you put it up because of what he did to advance this great nation, including fighting for laws and a formation of government that ultimately helped free the slaves. We tend to think we should focus on the good of what a person did. You can find skeletons in everyone's closet. Should we undo the good MLK did because he was a womanizer? No. Nobody is perfect. Holding anyone to that ideal and saying they should be disregarded is insanity. Ghandi wasn't perfect, Mother Theresa wasn't perfect. George Washington wasn't perfect. The best countries in the world are not perfect. Do not throw the baby out with the bath water. Lol, I don't care what you think. I don't need a safe space.It's insane you guys put that on us. Liberals invented that, it's always been a liberal thing. But a common tactic of leftist despots is to blame your enemy of your own crimes. :) have fun living in your delusion. Maybe try to stick with actual arguments instead of looking for any opportunity at all to insult republicans, even when it doesn't make sense. Who doesn't hate Cuomo? I hear liberals on here hating on Cuomo all the time.Also, nice tired old insult you always say. Get a new repertoire. Kinda fun to watch people who hate Republicans bring up Republicans when Republicans have nothing to do with this.Good lord, man. Tone it down for once. I hope you aren't someone who hates ICE. Your sarcasm is unnecessary.You are acting like justice is being served. No, opportunists are exploiting laws that are often silly. I'm not sure I understand why natural evil is considered evil at all? It seems it is only considered evil as a means to explain suffering, which seems to me to be why the it's-a-fallen-world argument seems so unsatisfying.It seems to me that choice is the sole answer to the question of suffering. The natural evils, as you describe them, are merely the externalities of original sin.I would argue that the Christian paradigm also would need to include an actor with ulterior motives to God's. There is an enemy and the enemy may have effects that go beyond temptation.This will go beyond speculation and is just a theory I like to play with, but I tend to think viruses are genetic apparitions. I do not believe they are natural. I think they are manipulations of life that appear like life but require life to do what they "want". Viruses are oddly parallel to our concept of demons and fallen angels in that regard. They don't seem to be able to act in the physical world, at least not much. Viruses are the same way, they cannot reproduce themselves, they must corrupt living cells to do that for them.I tend to think viruses are the means of corrupting the creation. That's just me toying with some ideas, but I do tend to think viruses are a key to understanding the fall as well as suffering in general. Yep, they are exploiting the laws for personal gain. This can't possibly have actually harmed anyone.This is one of the reasons small businesses are so difficult because there are so many stupid laws that end up costing a ton of money.I know PragerU is basically considered fascist propaganda here but there's a video about a diabetic cookie company owner that highlights some really stupid rules. And a lot of the same rules that strangle these companies are just exploited by opportunists to make money off of frivolous lawsuits. The video is below. I think most people can agree with virtually everything in this:https://youtu.be/JFsAkxzTFEs While you are technically correct, it is rather disappointing that people don't understand this. How much could the people possibly have been wronged by this.There are so many stupid and suffocating regulations out there. And yeah, people should be honest, but why is this worthy of a class action lawsuit. It sounds like an opportunistic individual just thought he or she could get some free money. No. First, I never said thisnguy is a pissy baby, I said people get overly dramatic on the internet, and that is a fact, see all of reddit and every comment section everywhere for evidence. I also said there are a lot of people who fall into this these days, again, see all of the internet for proof. I also said that lot of people support this drama these days, see all of the internet for proof. I also said I'm not innocent in all this, though I am certainly better than a lot of people on this issue.But another issue with today is that people are quick to dishonestly represent others and their arguments... you know, like saying I said everyone is a pissy baby but me.Take care. This is the conversation Trump and conservatives need to have. When we first talked trade war it just seemed like it's about tariffs fair trade. It is now clear to everyone that it is a culture war and a war of western ideals vs Sino-communist ideals. There will have to be some sacrifice to win this. Our economy may take some hits, and this will be necessary to keep down this horrible behavior in China and keeping it from expanding. Of course people can comprehend that the driver could have been negligent or distracted. That isn't the point. The point is you need evidence to convict someone in the court of law, and even in the court of public opinion. It seems people just want to believe the driver is evil when there are many reasons why this could have happened.Not every bicycle death is due to a drunk or distracted driver. Sometimes bicyclists make a bad choice, sometimes they have an accident. This is why hate passing them close because if they slip on a small stick and fall towards my car, they could easily die.You guys first seemed to think he was distracted... the dude is what, 80? I see a lot of old drivers who drive kinda slow and annoyingly, but I don't see them texting or changing cds or fidgeting with devices to find their next podcast. It's still possible he was distracted, but that kinda puts a huge hole in that narrative, and again, where is the proof.Does anyone remember what due process is anymore? Yeah, I shouldn't be surprised, that is kind of what the internet was built on. God knows I've played into it myself. I just wish we would learn our lesson as a society a little faster. It's the same kind of drama you see on Yelp. It's this keyboard courage kind of drama where the issue was minor at worst, there was a means of dealing with it, but because it wasn't immediately resolved they got all pissy and went to the internet.If a Democrat candidate put something on my lawn I'd just toss it out and contact them quietly asking them to take my household off whatever list they have it on. I wouldn't take to the internet because they didnt resolve it in 24 hours.This is how adults would handle these things 15 years ago. It was clearly a mistake. There's no need to be so dramatic. They shouldn't be doing it, but why go on a tirade about it? This is one of those problems that doesn't require media outreach because they gave you a means of easily contacting them and letting them rectify the issue. The future is going to be annoying. This is stupid. Haha this is true. Though it can be hard to assume the reasoning of down voters on here. I can see some people who are just really averse to any and all comparisons to Hitler because they don't understand the nuance many times. Just calling some dude Hitler is not valid. But comparing a strategy and behavior of Hitler and his propaganda tactics, or his insights into the discourse as you have highlighted, is not the same thing as just saying "Bush is as bad as Hitler!"This of course still plays into their tactics. I have mostly democratic friends... most are super cool and respectfully disagree on things but some make you feel like you're walking on eggshells around them so you really pick your battles with them.In the right atmosphere, with the right amount of knowledge, with some quick wit, and some confidence you can pulls some people into a more centrist view if not right on a single issue or two (for at least the time they are there speaking with you). I tend to avoid the hot button issues... I know a lot of people in education which is a big issue but not like abortion or something else. You can sway a lot of people because that system is a mess and people in education know it. So sometimes you can easily get a few lightbulb moments.Anyway, sometimes it's easy to converse with Democrats, other times it is like asking for a whipping. Good luck in your run! At a cursory glance at your platform I would certainly give you my vote if I lived in your district.Thank you for your service, btw! Why on earth would they call security on you? My God, what idiots we have in the world spoiling normal human conversation because they hate it.The left makes me constantly want to apologize for humanity. I dont know why you've been downvoted. Though we do have quite a few trolls that linger here despite being banned. It's a democratic republic... You are missing the point the person made. They are referring to the ~10% of black voters, the 31% of Hispanic, and 23% of Asian.You made your point thinking that the OP didn't understand the numbers, they did. They were speaking to the fact that all these minority people not voting democrat and turning republican is a significant hole in the idea that republicans are a white racist extremist party.Take care. There's the smart assy comment I was looking for :) Thanks. They were concern trolling and then immediately went to r/republicansarescum and r/aoc to brag about being banned from our sub. It was an account of only a couple days old with very low karma who was clearly here to troll. I didn't know r/republicansarescum is a sub until this user posted there... so that's fun.Basically they soft slammed the user saying they think the user made up the story, standing on the idea that you should think policy rather than how your family treats you when deciding your political beliefs and affiliations. Which is true, but the OP never said that that is why they decided to be republican, they just said that that is why they are afraid to come out as one. So I banned them for concern trolling, and as of just before I posted this comment I saw that it was indeed a good ban. I live in a blue state and in a very blue area of that blue state, but I'm white as the driven snow. So it's kinda hard for me with mostly leftist friends. God bless folks like you who have it way harder.The way I handle it I guess is sort of an honest concern trolling or a really soft sell on a somewhat non-partisan issues. Like if environmentalism comes up, I might make some points based on research and hard facts that show the situation isn't quite so dire just to break up that narrative a little in their heads. So like you talk about how most landfills use the decomposing biomass to to create and collect natural gas in significant quantities, and that once all the bio mass is gone, we can probably open them back up for a lot of usable material. Little things like that show people there is hope and that the market is working a lot of its magic without it becoming a huge political debate. If they worry about fresh water running out, I mention the massive desalinization plants that provide Israel with more fresh water than it needs in the middle of a desert and a salt water ocean and that California has plans to build one.It feels almost dishonest when I do it, but I never lie, I always source my facts, I always bring it up naturally. You can do this with a lot of sensitive topics. Like with immigration, just reminding people how many people we let into the country legally each year can help because they all seem to feel like that number is 0. That one is a little tougher to naturally inject into a conversation.Maybe that strategy can work for you, too. And by work I mean it doesn't "work" to really convince anyone they might not want to vote democrat anymore, but that it works to inject a little more reason into the overall discourse. And I believe reason favors the right.Anyway, I feel for ya, man. Good luck! Man, that has got to be a tricky family situation. My cousin married a Dominican and she is lovely and one of my favorite people in my whole family, but talking politics around her is a no go because the immigration questions are sooooo sensitive.My cousin is really business savvy and revered Donald Trump as a late teenager, college student, and young adult. He had Trump brand shirts and ties and always talked about Trump being a "Balla". I imagine he doesn't bring that up much at home anymore.I think the democrat leadership feeds on this tension that plays out in people's families. It really riles people up against republicans because our view generally does argue that many otherwise wonderful people shouldn't be here, shouldn't receive medical care or welfare, or should at the very least work much harder in becoming legal citizens. And it's a shitty situation, but legal immigrants and naturalized citizens didn't cause it. People coming illegally, or people not maintaining their legal status did. There is certainly room for some of this, but we catch more flies with honey. This is true and I love Peterson. But at the same time, some tact is useful and prudent in many situations. Picking your battles is important. Amen! No, you argued a point I wasn't making and implied I was an imbecile. You also disregarded my resources as "anti-environmental" bullshit, but you didn't even check them out. They aren't anti-anvironmental. You can say that recycling isn't efficient at all without saying that we shouldn't do it but you keep doing that with points that go against things you support. Electric cars don't currently add a net benefit to the environment and in fact make it worse, that is true. But you toss that out because you fear that fact will be used to say no one should be electric. I know no one who argues that we shouldn't pursue electric. So you are censoring facts for fear of an environmental enemy that doesn't even exist. This waving away of these facts and castigating anyone and and fact tht doesnt agree with you as "anti-environmentalist" is dishonest. Stand by your arguments not your bad faith rhetoric.Again, you and others have been dishonest almost from the beginning by attacking my character and waving away valid sources based on your belief I am some anti-environmental troll. I suggest you go back as well.I am not an anti-environmentalist, I didn't use anti-environmentalist arguments nor did I use anti-environmentalist resources. It is absurd you seem to think that anyone who disagrees with some generally accepted environmental ideas is anti-environment when there are valid reasons not to support many aspects of the most popular environmental causes. That doesn't deny climate change, that doesn't deny anything except specific points within the overall environmentalist gospel that don't work. For instance, I can say "you know properly handled landfills aren't as bad for the environment as you think, and in fact provide a very significant quantity of natural gas as biomass within the landfill decomposes. And after the bio mass completely decomposes, there will likely be material we can use from the remainder." That is all true. And yet because it doesn't shame the use of landfills, you will say I'm anti-environmentalist for even suggesting it. Spanish inquisition much? Witch hunt much? I mean good lord, the lack of historical and contemporary awareness is absolutely shocking.I hope you see the dishonesty or your style and content of arguing. If you think the environment is really at stake then you should make your case better rather than bully your idea onto others.Take care.P.S. I'm sorry I keep responding to you, I keep toggling inbox replies off, but considering you are willing to attack my character and call me an imbecile, I should just block you. That's my bad. The lesties that do it seem to always say they were conservative "until they read some books" or something else really condescending, and I always think "what books?" It wasn't the Federalist papers.It's the same thing with a lot of former Christians. I always want to know what books, because half the time it seems they saw Zeitgeist and read the intro to Dawkin's The God Delusion and that's it. And the The God Delusion is pretty easily debunkable because it cherry picks pretty much all it's big arguments saying that God is evil if He exists. And Zeitgeist is primarily based on a book written by a New Age channeler who claims she channeled the book. There are valid reasons to be atheist, but that book and that "documentary" don't hold them.I registered Republican when I registered to vote at 18. I took a pretty hard left turn in college and for a while after when I lived in NYC. I never actually switched registration but I was a Democrat atheist/agnostic type for about 3 years. I didn't really have a reason. It wasn't really about policy, it was mostly because Obama seemed to publically speak well, because I was watching a lot of The Daily Show and Stephen Colbert on comedy central, because I lived in NYC surrounded by leftists, because I had seen a few too many Alex Jones documentaries which just shattered my faith in any politics, and because I started getting this twisted thinking about the conservative policies I used to believe in.I thank God I saw the light.EDIT: Fixed the title for Dawkins' book, after all, we should properly cite. You're welcome. Also, don't mind the trolls. We get a lot of them. How dare you?! You have stolen my dreams... of playing Skyrim without being reminded of horrible leftist adults abusing misguided children for political gain. It was hyperbole, and I made that clear. Though based on your behavior, we were probably a comment or two away from you actually calling me racist. You already called me a liar. And you have been a bully, twisting my words, name calling, libeling me as a liar, and being far too aggressive. Now you are taking hyperbole, which I clearly labeled as hyperbole and say I put words in your mouth. That actually *is* a lie. So if anyone in this thread could rationally call the other a liar, it's me calling you one, because that is a straight up lie you just told.But I'm not going to call you a liar because I just think that was a dumb lapse in judgement and that your behavior here is hopefully just the result of a bad day and not your typical behavior. When you immediately go with character attacks to argue, your character is the one that comes out looking bad :)You got spanked, bro. You know it. Now try to say something smart assy to save face. Welcome to the team! :) Happy to have you. Funny, I used to be Democrat until I read some books. You have again dishonestly  twisted my words. The difference here seems to be that you are willing to name call and twist words, I am not. We appreciate your curiosity and it is awesome you are looking for a challenge to your current view. However this is not really the purpose of our sub. Please check out r/askaconservative.They are not strictly republican, but many, if not most Republicans, are conservative. Please observe our civility rules. If you feel there is a troll or someone who is not here to discuss in good faith, just report and move on. You are not arguing in good faith and you are applying intentions to me that you can't rightly apply, and claiming I am ignorant despite the fact I know your points, because I've heard them. You don't seem to know mine though and just toss them out because you don't like them. I do care about ALL the facts, you apparently like to demonize people who simply disagree with you.You are doing the equivalent of this:mikeyph: Hey, I read this thing about the sky not really being blue, it just appears blue. Kinda cool, I thought.rook218: The sky is blue!!mikeyph: well, kinda. Yeah it appears blue but that is because of light refraction as it travels through the atmosphere in a way that appears blue to us. So you aren't exactly right because it's more complicated than you put :) you have a nice day now!rook218: YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT FACTS AND YOU ARE LYING TO THE PEOPLE!mikeyph: No, I'm not lying and I've read a lot about this including the studies you seem to be citing about the sky being blue. I am merely saying it is more complicated and I think you might not have quite the right perspective on this. Still though, you have a nice day.rook218: LOOK AT THIS PICTURE! I TOOK IT THIS MORNING! IT'S THE SKY! NOTICE ANTHING MIKEYPH!?!?!? HMMMMM??? IT'S FUCKING BLUE!!! YOU RACIST ASSHOLE!This is obviously a hyperbolic, but you won't agree with this assessment even knowing it is meant to be a slightly exaggerated depiction.>But you don't care to talk about ALL the facts, do you?*But yeah, I dont care none fer facts, I reckon. I just reed dem fancy books and artickles cuz I wants my mama to think I done finished hi school. I reckon I best be fixin to go back to shovelin cow turds cuz this smart book man done notices I's a liar just tryin to lie some for no apparent reason.*When you make everyone who disagrees with you your enemy, you don't really have any friends.Take care. No, I'm saying that it is not as cut and dry as people have made it sound.I mean obviously if we all just ate food out of our home gardens then yeah, but that's not how it works. But expanding farms kills animals that naturally live where the farm now is, and the big tilling machine make sure that those animals die every harvest. I mean they completely flood fields to collect cranberries, what do you think happens to the animals that made a home there? (EDIT: damn this is not written well, forgive my bad writing folks, and thanks to those who upvoted despite my bad writing!)Not only that, but even crop rotation leads to tremendously sapped soil that very little can grow on and that takes a lot of care and time to restore. And they way people have been restoring these farms is with their livestock. There was a great episode of something I saw on PBS which showed people who buy these badly run large farms and then use their chickens and steer to go around and restore the soil with their droppings. When the farming is done more properly, animals will largely be what maintains the farm ecosystem and farms will be treated more as an ecosystem. If you just keep sapping all the nutrients out of the soil to make soy or coconut oil and other things to feed people, you ruin the soil, even if you add better fertilizer. https://www.cnet.com/news/beyond-meat-vs-impossible-burger-whats-the-difference/ That site shows what goes into an impossible burger and think about how large the farms are that supply most of these ingredients and how they likely aren't doing enough to stop the depletion of their soils.People do not have the full picture, they only have one view and it is a stunted view. For instance, people just hear that methane in the atmosphere is bad. They have no idea why or how it reacts in the atmosphere, they just hear that it is bad and is a greenhouse gas. They have no idea that it becomes water and CO2 in the air as it reacts with the hydroxyl radical. And that sounds bad on the surface, but CO2 collection would effectively reduce the problem with methane entirely. In other words, carbon capture negates the methane issue. It is just a CO2 issue. So the whole reason methane is an issue is really because CO2 is an issue.People think it just sits there and never goes away because no one teaches them and they don't teach themselves. So people push this idea that only a vegetarian diet will reduce carbon and be good for the environment, when in reality that will strip soil of it's nutrients worse than we already do.But you don't really care to talk facts now, do you? I didn't name call, not sure why you are. The publications are not "anti-environmental". It seems you just assume that because these points go against your world view.Secondly, to your point about animal grazing. When done properly, and frankly, even when done poorly, it uses less space, requires less machining of the land, and requires less pesticides that kills all kinds of biomass than vegetable farms that produce the same amount to consumable food.Dude, I just posted an article about meat because it was interesting and new. I wasn't(edit, forgive the typo) trying to start something, but you responded in a combative way and are now name calling.>Same shit with people who shit on hybrid cars by going in depth about the entire manufacturing process behind them, while only comparing it to the fuel usage of a traditional gasoline car. It might all be facts, but presented in a tremendously misleading way. Only imbeciles couldn't see through it.So it is misleading to say that producing such cars is currently far more harmful to the environment than producing regular cars? That doesn't negate the fact that if we can make them in a greener way they will obviously be better to use than combustion engine cars. But you seem to be denying facts because they don't directly cheer lead the idea that we should all go electric.Two things can be true 1) Electric cars will eventually be better for the environment, and 2) environmental issues from Electric car production currently outweighs the benefits of owning one today. You act like 2 hurts 1, or that 2 denies 1 and so you deny 2.Please don't name call. I'm not cherry picking. I'm just saying it is not gospel to say that a strictly vegetarian lifestyle is better for the reasons generally purported. I presented you with other objective facts, you are selecting the one that seems more valid to your decisions when there are many other factors to consider. The kid shouldn't have swung at a cop, it's just stupid and any cop, even one that defends and upholds a horrible country, should rightly be able to defend himself.But when does a riot become a revolution? That is the point of this, that is why the world is watching closely. You are acting like this isn't news because a lot of people have the narrative wrong and think the kid was innocent in this. It's still news. It's still huge news.Considering the Chinese government is responsible for all kinds of human rights abuses including organ harvesting from their poor and the Muslims they have in prison camps, considering their prisons are brutal and they throw anyone in them for speaking against the president, a protest against such a government turning into a riot and a revolution is far more understandable... they have far more reason to riot ad to revolt than all these pussies in the western world who riot after things like an election not going the way they wanted. I wasn't attacking you, it was just an interesting article I read. But...https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/veganism-environment-veganuary-friendly-food-diet-damage-hodmedods-protein-crops-jack-monroe-a8177541.htmlAnd:https://theconversation.com/ordering-the-vegetarian-meal-theres-more-animal-blood-on-your-hands-4659The amount of ingredients, time, and energy that goes into an impossible burger requires a hell of a lot more energy and types of products that are made en masse, thus requiring much more environmental space to create, thus having a greater environmental impact.Yeah, factory farming is not good, yeah, it can lead to some bad environmental issues... but these kinds of products don't really help and end in a lot more animal deaths than people realize, the animals that die just aren't cows and pigs. Did you see this? I don't limit my meat intake, but this still surprised me.https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2019/10/02/red-meat-study-known-health-risks-unfounded-doctors-decry-guidelines/3838947002/ There are conspiracy theories out there that the elites of the world participate in child sacrifice. Honestly, when you look at stuff like Epstein's island, I wouldn't put it past some people, and when you look at recent history there is some super twisted shit out there that happens, and some very elite people often get involved because it's "new" and "society just doesn't understand". Aleister Crowley was a twisted dude and had the ear of quite a few rather elite folks. There is video of Angelina Jolie getting involved in a weird bondage sex group and how it is this weird spiritual experience. Then you have the Nexium Cult. You have Epstein island. Plus you have legitimate stories about real organ harvesting in China... it happens in the US it's just not apparently on a massive scale here like it is in China. Who does this in China? The elites, the people who can afford to, and they rely on people with no power to get those organs (In China's case, poor people and the Muslims they have in internment camps... this is documented, it's also happening in Africa). This is a very small though legitimate concern with why controlling our borders is important. It helps prevent abuses by super twisted people. Do you think people who are willing to lie and spend a lot of money just to get their precious kid into the college they want, people who are vain as hell, will not think about buying black market organs when their lives are threatened by an illness and aren't treated special in the system? When you have a flood of people coming into the country who are vulnerable and you and a small group of very wealthy people have the desire, they can pay people to traffic humans and harvest their organs. It sounds so fucked up because it is, but because it sounds so fucked up, people think it's not real. It is real, it is just a matter of scale. How many people are doing it and how much does it happen in countries like the US? If you have a wealthy person who's kidney is shutting down for some reason and you have babies delivered but the parent wants them aborted, why waste the organ, you know? This is where it gets to be a conspiracy theory, but the motive to do it certainly comes up from time to time and based on history, we know people have been willing to do these things for years.So anyway, when a woman like this wacko says something crazy, she is definitely ill or trolling or something. But there is a kernel of truth out there. I bet there are a few sick assholes out there who are willing to eat babies, but I also imagine they are incredibly rare... but looking the other way when you need an organ for yourself or a loved on? I can see that happening quite a bit because it does.Yeah, it sounds like a conspiracy theory, but the fact is that it happens and will continue to happen if not kept in check.Still, what the woman said is nuts. You label the group as a whole, those who are not extremists will start a legitimate group that doesn't support terrorism.You are acting like this is a bad thing for free speech or something. Just tossing the term around is not good, but when people actually commit terror then that's a good rule of thumb. We did find something indictment worthy, but Comey backed off on it because he's an asshole. Yeah, and a lot of the trash from Canada ends up in the US, like soft Socialism and smug leftwing politicians. Antifa is a multinational group. Lol your argument here is asinine. If they see something that we don't, then their vote should go another way. That is very rare, but it might be necessary. Leftists had no problem intimidating electors who were pledged to Trump... so clearly you guys are okay with electors not voting for whom they are pledge to vote. We take the stance that that should only happen in very rare circumstances.It has everything to do with checks and balances. You just don't like it and have no argument to dispute it.  Be honest with yourself.Take care. https://www.whistleblowers.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/un-convention-signatories.pdfAsking for any other country to investigate corruption is something they all agreed to do anyways. You need a quid pro quo, man. You act like there is no relationship at all with a country when you speak out against their bad behavior. We are constantly negotiating with China.You hold an opinion that you think Trump is not worth reelecting, that is fine. But you are convicting him of a crime when there is no crime and expecting everyone to agree with you.You are saying all republicans are bad if they don't agree with your assessment of his behavior as illegal. There are lots of restrictions to our rights that make sense and we have instituted for a long time, it is only recently it seems that this more absolutist approach has been adopted. The right to bear arms didn't mean you could shoot cannons wherever you wanted. The right to free speech doesn't mean lewd behavior has to be allowed in public. There is a difference between just plain nudity and lewd behavior. Public lewdness is illegal.Just because a group of people get a permit to have a parade or a public gathering doesn't mean you can just magically start stripping.If we don't restrict rights at all then we must allow people to yell "fire" in a crowded theater just to screw with them, leading to injuries or deaths. Libel laws restrict free speech in the absolute sense Should we abolish those?By the way, a lot of conservatives these days take a very classically liberal approach. Even classical liberals like Jefferson wouldn't think lewdness in public is okay. They are not an "official organization" they have cells that all act on their own. (edit) Kinda sounds like terrorists, doesn't it?No one is saying dissenting views ought to be labeled terrorism, we are saying terrorism ought to be labeled terrorism. I didnt say they had any other power than to elect the president. I don't know why you are clarifying that except to twist what I am saying.Secondly, when I say something fishy, I mean a false story that goes out the day before the election but is debunked the day of the election. I mean election tampering. I mean some kind of media blackout or an attack that happens between the final counts and the electoral vote. These things would probably never happen, but they could and that is the point. The idea is that the electorate would be privy to this information when the rest of the country might not have been the moment they voted.There are many reasons why it exists and why it is good for our nation. Yeah, once in a while you'll get someone win the popular vote but lose the election. Tough shit. That shows us that our checks and balances are healthy. I'm aware of that. A degree of water change, even two or three will cause almost not thermal expansion. They keep making that sound like it's a huge deal, it's not. I read one estimate that said thermal expansion is reappnsible for .6mm of sea level rise each year.That is nothing. The favor? No. It's a request to look into Russian election interference. That is not good for any American. To pretend this helps his campaign beyond saying that he is trying to stop Russian interference is dishonest.The Biden question is the only possibly incriminating part. But possibly incriminating and actually incriminating are different things. In other words something can be directly incriminating, they can look very clearly like something bad happened, though we aren't sure something bad happened. Possibly incriminating would mean that there could be something there. Using the word "favor" is possibly incriminating, but it is not direct. These are not legal terms, I dont expect people to adopt these terms but the idea is true. Witch hunts are all based on things that are possibly incriminating or remotely incriminating... it's usually not actually incriminating evidence that is used.Probable cause doesn't apply here, but if it did, there would be no probable cause. People ask for favors all the time. That isn't bad. What is bad is asking for a favor and offering up some service you can't rightly do as president. And that particular favor was a request to look into Russian election meddling in the 2016 election. That is something everyone wanted him to look into.Plus, we have a treaty with 160 other countries to watch corruption for each other. Checking on Biden would be something they already agreed to do based on that treaty anyway. So the second questionable piece of the memcon was asking for something they should already be doing. Plus the Ukrainians didnt even know the aid money was being withheld. Checking to make sure a government is corrupt is a perfectly valid reason to withhold aid money. And they released the aid money without any promises made to the president. When I challenged someone on it they just quoted the part where he used the word "favor". It's like there is no nuance to words now and because Tony Soprano might have asked for a favor or two, that means all favors that anyone asks for ever are illegal.I also explained to them that that particular paragraph was about the Russian election interference issue that Dems have been asking him to look into. They don't seem to remember that anymore or something. I think you twist many righteous ideas into something not so righteous. You say that the impeachment process doesn't undermine the system... it does when it is used improperly. You don't think it's improper in this case but you are ignoring that this plan was hatched since before he was elected, that Adam Schiff knew the contents of the whistel blower report before it came out (which is exactly like what happened with Blasey-Ford), and that the Russian collusion scandal was a 3 year witch hunt. And  ow impeachment is being talked about despite the dems not actually pulling the trigger... why? Because it is entirely political. That is not the point of impeachment. Secondly, you say you want more scrutiny on the president. I'm okay with more scrutiny but they need to be able to have conversations with foreign leaders without them all being leaked. If that happened to Obama you would be furious. You would think it was a witch hunt, because it would be. And you talk about more scrutiny, have you not seen the media? This president has been under more scrutiny than any other president. Obama got all kinds of softball questions all the time, Trump had never gotten a softball question. The media blasted the Russian collusion story for 2.5 years which came back with NOTHING. The fast and furious scandal under Obama wasn't mentioned at all.There is already a lot of scrutiny over the president. There are many checks and balances in place. And the media has scrutinized this president more than any other. What more do you want? The only thing more you could have is pushing for more leaks which literally undermines the office of the presidency.It is absolutely insane that you people think there needs to be more scrutiny. OBAMA used the FBI to investigate the guy! Clinton's campaign PAID for the fusion GPS dossier. There's some more scrutiny for you and some insanely immoral and dangerous scrutiny that never should have happened.Your answer is sad. You want more scrutiny and deny the massive scrutinization that has already happened.It is utterly insane and the left has no idea what they are doing to the country. You guys done fucked up. You ARE undermining the country and you don't realize but you are undermining your own party. It would be funny if it weren't so damn scary. This is why the right can't talk with you. You guys keep going for broke on everything.So many of you think that "favor" paragraph was bad because you guys dont realize what it is. It was trump legally and responsibly asking Ukraine to look into Russian election interference WHICH THE LEFT ASKED TRUMP TO DO. That was a favor for the entire country. It was a favor to protect our election process. It wasn't a favor to help him. No one on the left realizes that because they dont care.They see the word "favor" and that is literally enough for you. Leaders do favors all the time it is only bad when it uses the office to personally benefit. The Biden paragraph was questionable. But still there was nothing illegal in there. You guys are nuts. It's fucking scary to see you guys implode like this and refuse to even consider you might be wrong. We're willing to let an investigation happen despite this damn witch hunt lasting good entire presidency. NOTHING has been found in this whole three years but you want more. We're seeing to give you more because we're reasonable but ffs is it going to end when you see Schiff orchestrated all this? Or are you not going to believe that either? Yes, that favor was in regards to Russian meddling in US elections. That is what that paragraph is about, that is why he mentions that company name at the end.The questionable part is the Biden party but there is no quid pro quo there and we have treaties with the Ukraine and many other countries to investigate corruption for each other.Not every favor is illegal... you and Schiff watch the Sopranos one too many times.EDIT: just an additional point about the "favor" part. The Democrats have been asking for Trump to look into Russian meddling. That paragraph is perfectly appropriate. Are you going to have the same problem with words like "offer", "deal", or "trade", because gangsters say a lot of words that everyone says. You guys should be pretty upset at Schiff too, because he and other dems have lied to you. They know that paragraph is perfectly fine and yet they led you to believe it was illegal. The Biden paragraph sounds iffy but it is not actual evidence of wrong doing. It's evidence that wrong doing was possible. That is very different. You need to prove extortion happened. You only have suspicions. No, I knew what you were saying and i was disagreeing. You are misrepresenting what the electoral college is and why it exists. The electoral college was designed solely with the intent to be a means of separating the powers of the government. The original idea was that Congress would elect the president, making it a federal power. This was tossed out and the electoral college idea was implemented which gave power to the states to elect the president. How the states implement that election process is largely up to them. It doesn't have to do with disenfranchised voters in the sense you are speaking.There have certainly been some historic accounts of voter suppression as well as laws that restricted the power of certain(type fix) states due to how black people were counted. But that has nothing to do with why the electoral college exists, nor how it functions, nor its validity today.Another reason for it is that news travelled slow at the time. So electors would have information the rest of the population might not on election day. This isn't disenfranchisement.The federalist number 10 specifically argues about the fear that people could act as a faction either in a majority or minority that vote in some way that goes against the people. There is clearly a fear or a majority acting impulsively and a minority acting impulsively to the point of swaying an election. This could happen today in the form of massive voter fraud, or if some lie is spread about a candidate just before the election day without time to rescind the story.Again, the reasons for the electoral college are to balance the powers between the state and federal governments, as well as to act as a means to ensure nothing fishy goes on in the election process. I agree. Small states can be easily disenfranchised by states with massive populations. The fact that we have a Senate and Congress is meant to alleviate that issue as well, it allows for both each state to have an equal say and for states with bigger population to have a greater say at the same time.There is a legitimate fear of the tyranny of the majority. The electoral college helps alleviate that issue by making it so that it is not always majority rule. If the majority of people live in cities and suburbs and see no need for guns because they are never more than 2 minutes away from police officers who have guns, then they might try to legislate in ways that hurt people in a minoroty simply because they don't know the totality of the situation and that things are often more complex than people want to believe. Yes it is a sin. There are two questions that arise though. Is it impossible to repent of a suicide? And is it possible that a sin that goes unrepented for is unforgiven?Catholics, if I'm not mistaken, tend to argue that you go to hell if you commit suicide without question. I believe they are mistaken. I think some of the reasoning is that you can't really repent of that sin once it is done. Except there are instances where people do, I've heard stories about people who survived a suicide attempt and immediately repented before they actually died and ended up surviving. Think about all the people who jumped off a building and regretted it as they fell but by then it was too late to take it back. So clearly it is possible to repent of a suicide attempt and still die. Some suicide attempts are very instantaneous, and so perhaps the person died without repenting. Are those people condemned to hell?Can we be condemned to hell on a sin for which we did not specifically repent while still having accepted Christ? We all still sin but we have repentant hearts after accepting Christ. There are things we do that we might not realize are sinful and yet still we have repentant hearts. There are times we knowingly do things that are sinful but we still have a repentant heart, and I believe that even if we fail to consciously repent of that sin that we still have forgiveness from it. God knows that the spirit may be willing but the flesh is weak, God knows we are all tempted. God knows we still all sin despite our being saved and having repentant hearts. There will be sins you don't specifically repent for when you are on your death bed, will God not forgive those? In the past, before Christ, it was possible. But also in the past they made sacrifices for sins that they are not sure they committed, and those were accepted by God. So God accepted repayment for conscious sins and sins they didn't know they committed. Our position is different, we have an irrevocable salvation, which covers the sins we know we committed, the sins we didnt know we committed, and the sins we have yet to repent for. Our accepting Christ is basically saying "I know I sin, I'm sorry that I sin, I wish to follow Christ, and I wish to live my sin behind. I will work to walk away from all the sin I can, and while I may still make mistakes, my heart is with Christ."A repentant spirit means your spirit is willing, that you bow to Christ and wish to do as he commands. It means you wish to change and to continue to be changed. Sometimes we find things in ourselves that need to be changed that we didn't see before. Ignorance isn't an excuse for breaking the law, but it is an excuse for children who are learning their way. That is what we are. Children constantly make mistakes, and we reprimand them, we even temporarily punish them, but we always forgive them (or we should). Now in our world, sometimes a child grows and never stops making mistakes, they hurt parents in some way, they fail to do what they need to do, etc. We should still forgive them, but we might need to kick them out of the house or something.It will be far easier not to sin when so much of the temptation is gone and our bodies restored. One of the biggest temptations that is ever present is our fear of death. Can you imagine how much anxiety and how many bad decisions will end when death ends? People won't be stepping over each other to ensure their posterity survives because all of out posterities will survive and thrive with us. There are some very elite people in the world who wish to live forever, and many not so elite people as well. They look towards AI and computers or other technologies with the hope that mankind will achieve immortality, and they do so without care or concern for the weak of the world. Many of these elites steal and control and manipulate to achieve a status that places them in a position to access that immortality if and when humankind were able to figure it out.That wouldn't exist in a world without death. And my point here is that God knows that the kingdom he desires and is planning for us will be easier to make good choices in. How many people won't steal simply because it never crosses their mind due to having everything they need? How many people won't even think to murder because they have no fear or being caught stealing or have motive to collect someone's life insurance or something? And God will be so close for us then.God knows it is hard right now to live without sin let alone repent of every single sin that we commit the very second we commit it. He knows we will die with sins for which we haven't specifically repented. The question is do you have a repentant heart?And if you are struggling with thoughts of suicide, are you forgiving yourself of your shortcomings? We need to learn to forgive ourselves as much as we need to learn to forgive others. This is a valid criticism. Good job. You are confusing popular vote with the system we have, which there are reasons for.The will of the people is the result of the vote. I said that one was debatable. Surely though if that was impeachable but the left said it wasn't at the time, but today they say this is impeachable with no actual crime, then they have a bad double standard. My point is that sea ice melt likely has more mass than the glacial ice. The left tends to think that all the ice will add to sea level rise and that just isn't true. Yes, there is something you are missing. An echo chamber is when someone has no exposure to substantive arguments from opposing views to theirs. That is bad.Republicans who come here and do that to themselves should stop... they should start looking at r/politics and other subs and read the articles they post from left leaning sources and read or listen to some of the best arguments of opposing views.Creating a place where Republicans can simply converse with themselves is not creating an echo chamber. You are responsible for your own media consumption, you create your own echo chamber. We are not creating an echo chamber, we are simply creating a place for Republicans to discuss things with themselves.Now there are websites who make it harder to naturally break out of an echo chamber. When Facebook curates articles and ads that feed only what you believe already, that makes it far easier to create an echo chamber for yourself. They also have hidden posts from connections that you have who have opposing views to yours. This is not good, Facebook shouldn't do that, we should face oppositional views even if it makes social media like Facebook less pleasant. Still, the responsibility is on the user to seek out opposing views and take them seriously. It is your responsibility to monitor your own echo chamber.It is also your responsibility to monitor the communities you are in and try to help them from becoming an echo chamber, which goes to the heart of what you are saying. But here is the thing, we share a lot of opposing views here, there are moderate Republicans, conservative Republicans, libertarian Republicans, pro-life Republicans, pro-choice republicans, isolationist Republicans, more interventionist Republicans, and so on. We will discuss with liberals and leftists who come in very frequently. But we will also ban those liberals and leftists who come in only to argue the same leftist or liberal talking points we hear all over reddit. This is not a place for them to do that, this is a place for Republicans to discuss things.There are plenty of places to respectfully debate conservatives and Republicans on reddit, it is not necessary to do it here. Further, we do  not want to allow the imbalance that happens in purportedly neutral subs like r/politics to come here. That sub could be a place where everyone discusses the day's news from.many perspectives but it has become a place where only a narrow set of views is allowed, and that is enforced either through moderating or through mass downvoting of people who are making valid arguments that happen to be conservative or happen to go against their views.This is a partisan sub, you should expect some minimizing of opposing views here. You should expect that on Democrat subs. You should not expect it on subs like r/politics, and yet it is very bad there.So when you say we seem to be creating an echo chamber, tell that to all the users here who still see r/politics, r/worldnews, all the hometown subs that all lean left, and all the apolitical subs that all lean hard left. I mean I was on the Rick and Morty sub which is for a cartoon. I made a point that wasn't that conservative and it was downvoted to hell. You want to talk about echo chambers, the left echo chamber is a massive one. Even those who try to get out of it, often only do so superficially. They'll come here claiming they want to expand their view of right leaning positions but all they end up doing is spewing more leftist talking points. A person truly trying to expand their view wouldn't be afraid of reading a daily wire article or a Breitbart article and admitting when they get some things right while, admitting when something is a difference of opinion, and holding them accountable when they get something wrong.I do that with HuffPo and Vox articles and I think both those publications are trash. They get some stuff right sometimes.I would ask you to please not continue this debate here as we have heard it a million times before. I think this is a myth and depends greatly on how bad the effects will be. Ocean levels haven't really risen much and I don't think they will. Antarctic ice is increasing while sea ice is melting.... sea ice melting doesnt really effect height of the water (put ice in a cup with water, mark the water level, then let the ice melt, it will remain the same level because water contracts as it melts). Glacial melt will have a small effect. So these island countries will most likely not disappear or even be affected that much, most of these island nations don't exist on islands that rise only a few feet over sea level.Secondly, if the sea levels rise more than a foot or two, in many ways it is far easier for less developed nations to adjust. It is much less expensive and difficult to move huts, cabins and small wooden buildings than to move large concrete and iron buildings or to retrofit large civil engineering projects like harbors and such.What has been affecting them far more than the actual changes to the climate are the regulations the world imposes on them. You have communities in Africa who are out away from the cities who run and operate schools or other things and they have to limit there use of electricity because of restrictions on fossil fuel consumption. There was one story I read about a guy who had to choose between running the small refrigerator and lighting the room in which he worked for the public.These countries can't combat malaria like we did because the world imposed a ban on those pesticides, which were very effective, though obviously not without their costs. So because the pesticide made bald eagles eggs weaker, those countries have to deal with their malaria problem in very inefficient ways, which leads to a lot of fatalities from the disease. There are valid concerns to using such pesticides, but do they truly outweigh these 3rd world countries' right to help their own people? Forgive the length guys.The intent of this is being twisted. These should be things that the office uses against the country and that almost all agree is worthy of impeachment. People keep looking at this idea without remembering that the will of the people in their vote is a very highly held ideal. So turning over the will of the people ought to be very very carefully considered rather than pushed even before a president takes office like happened with Trump. And this was not intended to be "political" meaning it wasn't intended to be used as a partisan hit job on a president, and this particular impeachment has been.Technically you are correct in that impeachment proceedings can begin for almost any reason. Lying is certainly unbecoming of the president, so dems could call for impeachment on that, but they ought to think carefully. Sometimes presidents have to lie. Are you willing to go against the will of the people and undermine our system simply because you dont like the president and might have the numbers to do it? It's like using the nuclear option, you could but is it worth it for you and for the country? I'm not sure that Bill Clinton should have been impeached and it is good he didn't get removed from office, because it would have overturned the will of the people. Nadler said exactly this back in the 90s and I agree (I'll have to find the video). And Clinton clearly committed perjury and sexual harassment at the very least. Now Nadler is calling to overturn the will of the people on suspicion rather than fact.What is so alarming about all this is that you have Clinton who committed perjury clearly and the Republicans jumped on that, it was opportunistic and arguably worthy of impeachment though I don't think it was worthy enough, but now you have Dems pushing for impeachment based on locker room talk and suspicion from even before the election results came in. You have to admit that that is messed up and a miscarriage of the system.Is this the game you want to play? Do you want Republicans investigating every minor thing the next Democrat president does and want millions of tax payer dollars to find any suspicious thing to impeach them on? Sometimes suspicious activity isn't a sign of bad behavior, guys.Look, I'm all for making sure our presidents are on the up and up. But I'm not for witch hunts, I'm not for putting the president under a constant microscope and questioning absolutely everything he does because it undermines so much. That memcon shows two things that the dems found suspicious, one of which is utter bullshit. The "favor" was asking the Ukraine to look into Russian interference that supposedly originated in the Ukraine. Dems have been asking Trump to investigate that. Yet that was a huge red flag to dems for some reason. So the dems are undermining their own push to investigate Russian meddling with this.The second part where he talks about Biden specifically is more problematic and I understand investigating it, but frankly, it's not much. There is an international treaty from 2003 that about 160 countries signed (including the Ukraine and the US) that says we will all investigate corruption for each other. Corruption is corruption. Now should someone use that underhandedly and try to sway an election? No, though Biden is not polling to well it looks more and more like a Warren v. Trump election. But does that supercede corruption investigations?If this whiste blower didn't whistle blow, a valid look into corruption might have found nothing and it would have ended. If it found something, shouldn't the people know?It is shameful to spread the idea that impeachment can be used for anything because it gives people the false idea that when they dont like a president they can just call for impeachment and ignore the votes of millions of people. And before anyone talks about the popular vote, there is a reason the electoral college exists. I'm a roc area dude myself. I tend to run in very liberal circles though and then the sub is very very left. So it just seems like Rochester is doomed. I suppose though that tension between upstate and downstate does help make the upstate libs question a lot of the downstate leftist policies. You are considered a natural born citizen if you are born oversees to American parents. You said the dude threatened your family... Whatever man, you clearly are trying to avoid feeling responsible. That's not what I said at all. In fact I clearly said it was not right:>Again, the dude shouldn't have threatened you, but you started this whole thing.All I'm saying is that you need to take responsibility for what you did wrong and start driving like you know that people could die if you aren't careful, because they can. It's nice to see us all be able to come together to call this kind of crap out.The dude shouldn't have threatened you, but when you drive like a jerk and rear end someone, they tend to get mad. If he brake checked you, you were probably driving too close. Tailgating is dangerous. I imagine you tailgate people a lot considering you got brake checked and actually rear ended the dude. Give people space, man, be a decent driver.You have kids, man. It's time to grow up, this kind of behavior doesn't help you or your kids and it doesn't teach them how to be a good member of society.Again, the dude shouldn't have threatened you, but you started this whole thing.Own it.http://fleetanswers.com/content/why-tailgating-dangerous-driving-habit I agree that it seems inevitable. But I hope that we can call it out and at least not do it in the trollish way the left has been doing it. Saying "Hey Mr. Schiff, I do not appreciate the disgusting way you lied to the American public," is one thing, but railing on him and following him the way Cruz was followed at the airport is not cool.Telling Chris Cuomo he is dishonest is one thing, but just trolling him in a public place is not cool. Honestly, I found that one funny, because he is such a dishonest guy, but it still shouldn't have happened. Fair enough, but you are here to troll.Secondly, this paradigm of right and left is not very good. There should be an inverted pyramid. At the bottom point is anarchy, at the top wide part there should be totalitarian regimes of all kinds. In other words it should all be based on control. There are lots of reasons to look at Nazi's as socialists, they had a lot of control over private industry and their force and threats meant they had control over the means of production. I could go on.Anyway, the user you are responding to did err if you assume they meant to make a direct comparison to nazis and communism. But it was more likely they were simply talking about the dishonest use of children as a means to evoke strong emotions as they help spread propaganda, which was also done by communists.Take care. He is 35 and has been a resident of the US for 14 years... unless his residency is not counted while he has served, but I don't believe that would happen.So yes. He asked for 1) an investigation into the Russian hacking issue, that was the "favor" he asked for, and 2) an investigation into corruption of a sitting US vice president. There was an international treaty sign by the Ukraine and the US (among about 160 nations total) that each government promised they would investigate corruption for each other.There was literally nothing illegal in what he asked and he didn't offer anything in exchange. Most people didn't even know the aid money was being held up, including the Ukrainians.EDIT: and by the way, that first request was something the the Dems had been asking Trump to do since the beginning of this. Asking the Ukrainians to look into Russian hacking is not illegal. Incorrect. It is illegal to use the power of the office of the president to make a quid pro quo deal to get information about another candidate. If you are merely presented with information, that isn't illegal. You should be careful with that information because you don't necessarily know that it is true and the people that gave you the information might be attempting to sway things to their favor somehow. But corruption should be routed out.We also have a treaty with about 160 other countries that promises we will all investigate corruption in our governments for each other. It was signed in 2003, iirc. I'm glad you have a shitty song to play when you feel sad. You sound like you don't know the difference between need and want. No one is forcing anyone to do anything. No one needs to watch these shows. They want to watch these shows.The way people confuse needs and wants these days is sad. Making? Nobody is making you do anything. I agree with that but I there is a fine line between publically talking to these people and harassing them. I'm not sure we have figured that out yet.That said, I'm glad he's being called out. I forgot to mention, I don't remember the last time anyone posted anything about safe spaces.Btw, a safe space is when a group of pussies go into a publicly shared area and set up shop, kicking people out of that area like assholes who think they own everything. They also sometimes set this up in rooms that they signed up for with the school, and these are especially stupid because they have spaces for them to color or relax when they feel triggered.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdQ4vqCWYTwHere's a nice video of democratic socialists in a safe space. We just kick out assholes. Not quite instabanned but shortly you will be. By the way, no one saw your post or this comment. They were instantly removed by the automod for us to approve.I would suggest that this list you looked up is a leftist piece of propaganda by some world organization that just wants to knock the US down a peg.Anyway, take care. I'm an upstate NY conservative Republican. There are a lot of us around but I think we're a little skittish, especially among the big NYS city subs. Like it is me and one other kinda trollish right winger type on my home town's subreddit because we get nasty names and attitudes thrown at us all the time. The one guy deserves it, I do not.Anyway, shoot me a PM at some point. Maybe I can help out a bit.At the very least maybe we can trick them into paying into a gofundme to help us all move out of state, haha. Eh, I don't condone this. He kinda deserves it... but still. I don't want this as part of American politics. He and JJ Abrams are frauds for saying the new Star Wars movies are good. >What about all the Democrats who vote for criminal shitheads?Did I say that? I didn't, but it's a valid point... why are voters evil when it the Republican did wrong but not when a democrat did wrong? It shows an incongruity in the application of a standard.Whataboutism isn't inherently bad, it is when it is used to deflect that it is bad.For instance, if I catch a young man cheating on a test and he says "What about Janey? She cheated, too!" The point of the young man is to avoid getting in trouble by deflecting. This is bad whataboutism.However, if the teacher is clearly not applying standards equally, and the young man accepts full responsibility for his actions as well as the punishment, but says "Waht about Janey? She cheated, too. Why is she not in trouble?" Then he is not deflecting, he is calling out unequal application of a standard.So now, claiming whataboutism has become a logical fallacy in itself. You are claiming I am deflecting when I am not. I am arguing that you should stop applying a double standard.Despite all that, I never mentioned nor implied that in my comment and yet this is what you argued I did.And again, you don't know who I voted for. You are assuming things and this shows your dishonesty.This is why people who were very anti-trump are coming around to defend him. You'll hate them regardless if they voted for him or not. You just hate them because they are conservative. It is disgusting and you should be ashamed by such behavior.I hate being the adult in the room, but here we are. It WASN'T inherently bad. Now it kind of is. Historically, the first feminists wanted the right to vote and own property and to not be treated as second class citizens. That is a movement everyone on the right can get behind. Now they have this. There were two branches of feminism at the time. When feminism won these things, the reasonable branch bowed out of the debate because they achieved LEGAL equality under the law. The more radical feminists wanted something else.The radical feminists veered left but rode on some acceptable ideas. They wanted to be treated as equals in the work place and not be sexually harassed as they take on more roles in the work force. This is totally fair, we can get on board with that and we ARE on board with that. A secretary shouldn't have to worry about the men in the office grabbing her ass.But then they also started pushing this idea that society should accept that women can be just as promiscuous as men. First of all, society didn't accept men being promiscuous, but we knew it happened. Perhaps the social ramifications for male promiscuity were less severe than female promiscuity, but both were unacceptable socially. The radical feminists wanted female promiscuity to be looked at just the same as male promiscuity, they wanted society to look at promiscuous women the same as they look at promiscuous men. They wanted all the bad things that men do to be just as acceptable for women to do. That is dumb. Then they started looking at everything as male domination over women, so they burned their bras (never mind that bras help women). Some looked at language itself as an affront to women. There are feminists who think the capital letter I is phallic and only use lower case i's. Now we have people who are trying to abolish masculine and feminine nouns from the romance languages because they think that saying "la famille" in French is sexist.This brand of feminism is inherently bad. It seeks to destroy foundational aspects of our culture and rebuild it the same way the French did during the Reign of Terror after the revolution when they went around renaming anything that had any sort of biblical meaning. So a street name "St. Francis" was renamed to something secular (while they were imprisoning people and murdering them by the thousands). You shouldn't entirely erase the past... you can't do that anyway.Some common issues today with feminism include working in the military. There are valid reasons why women shouldn't be allowed in the military at all, or at least only in very limited roles. The military is about protecting lives, jobs in the military are not the same equal opportunity sorts of jobs in civilian lives. Fraternizing in the office might cost you your job and might lead to your family breaking apart. Fraternizing in the military might lead to people dying. Here is an article by a woman.https://www.wsj.com/articles/women-dont-belong-in-combat-units-11547411638We all believe women should have the right and responsibility to vote. We all believe they should be treated respectfully in the workplace. We believe they should be compensated fairly. Women have all of these things now. But another common argument of feminists today is the "gender pay gap". This is a myth. No one forces women to take less lucrative jobs, yet they do. And there are other reasons the pay gap is a myth.https://www.dailywire.com/news/7-facts-show-women-are-not-victims-pay-amanda-prestigiacomoThe original feminists weren't espousing a bad belief. They were fighting for legal equality. Modern feminists mostly spread myths and falsities that make them out to be victims of a perpetually patriarchy controlled world. A victimhood mentality is bad. First, an admitted crook?Second, no, I'm not comparing them. I'm saying you cannot blame voters the way you are.It is disgusting. I didn't blame the voters on Bill Clinton's lying under oath. I didn't blame the voters for Obama's Fast and Furious scandal. Why? Because that is what reasonable people do. So everyone who voted for Lovely Warren is responsible for her horrible behavior? Everyone who voted for Cuomo is responsible for his? We are getting for Cuomo exactly what everyone expected of Cuomo. Is everyone who voted for Hillary as a senator somehow responsible for her email scandal?When you use your logic, everyone is a horrible person. But you don't apply your standard to yourself, because this is a double standard. Be better.EDIT: by the way, to think that all the opposing people are uneducated voters is insane. You are dehumanizing your fellow americans. Some of the smartest people I know are not Democrats, some of the smartest people I know are Democrats. I think many Democrats are mistaken on many things but I never make them out to be the enemy for voting for people I find morally reprehensible. What? Do you know how whataboutism works?You don't know who I voted for anyway. You do realize that most people who vote regardless of their party affiliations don't do that much research. Blame the guy, sure. But the voters? Come on. We're the pathetic ones and yet you are the troll, one of the the most pathetic things someone can be who lives in the western world where there is so much to do and enjoy and so many ways to better your lives if you just focus on your own life. No, it doesn't make sense. I get what you tried to do, but you didn't do it well. Emojis just make it stupider. Now that doesn't make sense, you should sit down before you hurt yourself. You can't really screw something up that's already screwed up. "Game" is a metaphor. No one thinks this is a game. Good lord, this is the stupidest criticism to date. Lol not pissed off. All you do is apply intent to things you dont have the knowledge to apply intent to. To me, to trump, to all conservatives, to all Republicans. I actually think you have good intentions but your actions show that you are willing to name call and hurl personal attacks without actually defending your arguments. The rest of your arguments are lazily thrown together from the talking points you hear on television. It was you who hurled the first insult and you who continues to do so. You need substance to convince people, name calling doesnt do it.The funny thing is that I read much of the Mueller report. I read the entire Ukraine transcript and the whistle blower report. There is nothing there. You apparently didnt read it. Pelosi knows there is nothing there. All the dems know it. But they keep pushing along and lying to their constituents.You guys see the word "favor" and tell "See!" But when he asked for a favor he was talking about Russian election interference which the dems want him to investigate. He asked about Biden once, and we have a treaty with about 160 countries, Ukraine included, to investigate corruption for each other. You guys are so full of shit you haven't tasted it in your soup for decades... to borrow your father's silly saying. I'm done talking to you if all you're going to do is say "You are wrong and like to eat poop!Your father clearly was a very tolerant, well-read man. /sYou think we are monsters who don't care about crime? Are you for real? Your democrat leaders have had control of all the major cities for decades and African Americans have been dying from illegal gun violence, crack, meth, heroin... all of which are illegal. You dare say we don't care about crime when they haven't even tried to clean up the cities for African Americans.You are being duped and you. Using personal attacks to defend the people who actually don't care about crime is awful. I hope you see what they have done to you and your dad someday.By the way, my dad never made baseless character attacks against people. That is not something to revere in people. We don't revere it in Trump, we don't revere it in anyone. lol because it's common knowledge. You shouldn't vote. Lol, yes, it can be if it is directed at someone IN THE WORK PLACE. You are using the legal definition of work place harassment to define something that did not happen between people in a work place. That doesn't work.>He also regularly attacks individuals and companies that go against his will, especially on Twitter, which falls under a type of harassment.Harassment is not when someone says something you don't like on a platform that you can leave at any time and that you block the person on. Again, not harassment.You are calling everything you don't like harassment.Try learning English and definitions of things before you accuse people of crimes. And none of them stuck. None of them. If they'd have stuck the dems would have moved for impeachment years ago.So either you are wrong and your media and democratic leadership are lying to you, or Trump is the most powerful man who ever lived and has god like control over everything. Those are your two options.You are* being duped.You take care now. This is stupid and overly cynical. None of the evidence fits with the left's narrative, so all of the evidence suggests that the investigation should end. Obstruction? Like firing Comey which was well within his right and had no bearing on the investigation? That's not obstruction. Also, obstruction of justice only happens when there is an actual crime that someone is stopping someone from investigating. When there is no crime, then there is no obstruction, there has been no crime. I mean Trump himself released the transcript.Like I said, Im sure he has done some bad things in his past. But you are simply mistaken on obstruction. You are conflating the legal definition of obstruction and the general term obstruction. And that is why you are deceived. He hasn't obstructed anything legally, and even if you go by the general term of obstruction and think it applies to Comey's firing, it does not. He didnt get in the way of anything.You need proof. Not allegations. Not suspicions. Proof. You and the Democrats have nothing. You dont know why impeachment exists in the constitution, your leaders are making you think you can impeach for any reason including. There is a kernel of truth to that but the point of impeachment was not to kick out a president for traffic tickets or something like that, it is when they have actively worked against their own office. It is meant for big crimes. Here we literally have no crime, there is nothing and impeachment is being thrown around because of character. You are hoping to undo the will of the people who voted this man into office because you dont like him. Its pathetic. Oh there's a little dirt, sure. And we dont ignore it, but none of it has been illegal and it has all been either blown out of proportion by the left or completely fabricated by the left.Like the Comey firing. That could have been dirt, except he had every legal right, the investigation was pretty much over. The only reason he fired Comey was because Comey knew he was innocent but wouldn't publically clear him, and Comet knew Hillary was guilty but let her off. The timing was awful but the reason makes sense. If I know you're innocent and I won't just clear you,  instead I go on TV for hours and hours saying "his conduct had me very concerned" but never clearing you officially of the crime... you'd be pissed off, and you'd fire me if you legally could.So the left thinks that's dirt. We think it's not dirt, because it's not dirt. Lol see this is a horrible move you made. Again, you people dont seem to know what harassment means. It is aggressive pressure or intimidation. Calling someone nasty once or twice is not harassment. It's not nice, but its not harassment.And now you are saying I hate women based off what? The fact that I know what harassment actually means and you do not?I wouldn't call what you're doing here "harassment" but it is lying to claim to know something you don't know. Here comes another really expensive dog and pony show that won't find anything.Frankly I'm surprised Trump is as clean as you all have shown him to be with these endless investigations and witch hunts. That's not to say he hasn't done anything bad, though I don't know what that is. I'm sure he's slept around a bit. Who knows? But you guys keep trying to hit him and end up hitting your favorite leaders. Legal immigrants are not citizens. I didnt say that not cooperating with people who are out to get him is a defense against illegal activity. Why? Because there is no illegal activity. I am simply saying that because the left is reading into his behavior, claiming he is hiding something. But because nothing has been found, the reasonable explanation is that all his behavior is easily explainable by what I have mentioned before.You don't know if the activity is actually illegal yet and so far nothing has come out that makes things look worse, the transcript doesn't give any further indication that he dis anything illegal, and the whistleblower report says even less because the whistle blower knew even less than the transcript. If something illegal happened then we should have gotten more indication from the report and transcript, we got nothing more.What I said was that you can look at the transcript in many ways. Democrats are reading nefariousness into it, most others read that Trump was just bloviating like normal and that there is nothing damning at all. That fits the pattern we have seen from Trump from the very beginning, even before his presidency. No one has proven anything illegal happened, and so the best explanation of his behaviors are the ones I have mentioned. With the Comet firing it wasn't to stop an investigation, he was simply upset Comey didnt say what Comey and Trump both knew which was that he was innocent. He has clearly been frustrated by a left that has been out to get him from even before he won the presidency. And here in the transcript he is just bloviating.No illegal behavior is acceptable whether frustrated or not, but you are trying to say that my explanation of his actions is excusing his illegal activity... but no illegal activity has been proven. So your point doesn't make sense.No one is excusing illegal activity. There simply is no illegal activity.That is about all of your argument I read because that alone does your suspicion in. Let me show you how.If I see someone walking down the street in a hoodie and he looks like he's hiding his face and he's walking like he might be holding a gun, I might rightly ask him what he's up to. When I find out he had no gun and simply doesnt like to show his face, then it's over. I'm not excusing him from a crime, because he didn't commit one. That is what your argument did. What? We're not talking about sexual harassment. I dont think you know what harrass means. This is a red herring. No one cares about her age or her disability. What they are concerned with is her use by adults. It's not like she's doing this on her own, folks. She is being paraded around by adults as propaganda.People have used children to advance their causes rather dishonestly for a long time. Mao did it, the Nazis did, Stalin did did it... so you have extreme right and extreme left doing it and you have people falling for it.The argument should stand or fall on its own. Adding a kid only scored sympathy votes. It's always a ploy. When has he harassed people? Are you okay with the behavior of people who harass conservative politicians at airports. Because that is happening and Maxine Waters called for it. And she isn't the only one. You can cop that to the stupidity of one individual, but no one has called her out on it.And the amount of people who, after Steve Scalise was shot and nearly died said "good". These weren't fringe people, these were mainstream and upvoted or liked by a disturbing number of people. Even if that was a joke, it is fucked up.Again, the double standard is astounding. See we go on a case by case basis. Some are kidding some are not. We have the ability to look at that stuff and make fairly good judgments. Like Kathy Griffin and the severed head of Trump, utterly tasteless.... but clearly a joke. To you guys, nothing is a joke from Republicans or conservatives end. The double standard is impressive. What? He cracks jokes all the time.  Ut you guys don't seem to have a sense of humor. That is not what he said. He said he thinks the behavior was treasonous and that we used to handlentraitors differently. It was tasteless, yes. But it was not saying what you claim he said.Take care. He was kidding. Publically saying something like that is not the same as going through the back channels and secretly talking with Russians to get information.What's amazing is how many on the left took it so seriously and even seem to think that is a crime. You can think it is not good presidential behavior, but it is not even close to what you are making it out to be.You guys give a pass on celebrities who say violence should be committed against Trump supporters or Trump's family. But Trump makes a joke and you're all like "the world is ending! IMPEACH! IMPEACH NOW!!!"If you guys could see yourselves... I don't know that I'd say an affair isn't a legal matter, it depends on the context. A marriage is a legally binding agreement. An affair is a breach of that agreement. So it is a legal matter though I suppose it only comes up as a legal matter when a divorce is happening, or as evidence in another trial. A lot of things come up in court that speak to character or pattern of behavior. So? He was under oath. Btw, you say a Ukrainian official came out and said Biden did nothing wrong.The Ukrainian president said Trump did nothing wrong.You give Biden a pass but Trump you do not. I'm sorry, but that is a nasty double standard. You keep saying this behavior is illegal or bad, but it not illegal. So now all you have is that it is bad.I get what your issue is with it. As I said, I dont' believe it is good. But you act like this is far more than it is.Did you know presidents can threatening bombing? Did you know presidents can leverage these things? Just not for personal gain.>if a president encouraged a corrupt government to investigate you with no evidence?No evidence? There was evidence.I think you are now arguing in bad faith.Take care. It cost the american people nothing? Okay... It was a hoax in that there was nothing but conjecture and then millions upon millions of dollars were spent on it. They knew it was nothing, they were hoping. If you don't like the word "Hoax" fine, but it was a mess and it was indeed a witch hunt. Were you aware that we are in a treaty with the Ukraine and many other nations to investigate corruption?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_against_CorruptionEDIT: it's kinda hard to call what Trump did illegal when we have an international agreement to check on corruption for each other. I didn't say it was a hoax, I was saying that it became a witch hunt. There was nothing in it that stuck. No worries about the length, but I had to stop at your first paragraph to clear up what looks to be a pretty glaring error.Where did you hear he asked a "solid handful of times?"Did you read it or are you going by what Schiff said? Because I'm reading the transcript right now and I watched the entire hearing today.>The other thing,There's a lot of. talk about Biden's son,. that Eiden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me.This was the extent of the use of Biden's name. There was talk about a favor earlier in which he asks them to look into something with Crowdstrike which seems to refer to Russian interference back in 2016. I'm not sure though. You all wanted him to look more into that, and Obama failed to, so that would be a good thing... though it is admittedly cryptic... and this conversation would make sense considering Ukraine and the US share that enemy.Anyway, Zelensky then mentioned about how the new government will look under him, he did mentioned that he might be able to see about something and then they moved on. Biden's name was mentioned only twice and two favor were indeed requested.It sounds a bit like you are going by the opening remarks by Adam Schiff in which he was characterizing the conversation as like a mob shake down and the Trump made this suggestions several times.The irony is that he laments how some people might take that the wrong way... and then as you seem to show here, people did take it the wrong way which is much of what the democrats whole plan was today. They are going for the sound bytes.Below is the video from the hearing just before Adam Schiff clears up that misconception. The person you will see just before him is the Republican who called him out on it. https://youtu.be/wNDIOd4Dqa4?t=5993>Nothing sticks, but it certainly isn't for lack of evidence.You could say that about Hillary, you can say that certainly about Bill who knowingly perjured himself. >you don't actually go into Trump's actions.I did, they weren't good. Were they illegal? That is the question.>Trump pressured Ukraine to open an investigation into his political opponent over official US policy.Pressured? That's a matter of interpreting the transcript. You have to read very cynically into it to get that impression, even then, there is no smoking gun. I said it wasn't good, though it was not illegal (not based on the evidence at hand).>I can't even think of a proper comparison because it's just so preposterous.Like when Obama told the Russians to chill for a bit because they would have more ability to help after the election? Wink wink. He didn't want the Russians doing something that might hurt the election for dems... Btw, the attorney for the whistle blower worked for Clinton and Chuck Schumer. Fun fact. The left is talking about how suspicious certain things are, but completely ignore how suspicious that is.>I just need to reiterate what he did, he pressured a corrupt foreign government to investigate the former VP over official US policy.You are reading your preferred narrative into it as fact rather than doing what you can with only the facts. All we can say right now is that Trump wanted an investigation. Saying there was pressure is conjecture. If suggesting is "pressure" then no one should every suggest anything.>Whether or not he intended to use funds to pressure Ukraine further is a tangential issue in my opinionBut that is the crux of the issue. If funds aren't part of it, where is the pressure? You haven't even convinced me that it was "pressure". Everyone was telling him to give it to them anyway, the worry about corruption is valid so that explanation works.Look, it could be bad, that is possible. But I am not going to assume criminality when the evidence isn't there. I'm going with a narrative based on the evidence. The left has their narrative and is fighting tooth and nail to convince the world of it without any solid evidence thus far.You have to understand how this looks like just another hit job... like Kavanaugh, like the Russia collusion hoax, and so on. Nothing sticks, and millions of dollars have been wasted just trying to get rid of this one guy. If Republicans did all this same stuff to Obama, you would have been furious. So you can understand if we are skeptical. I'm all for the truth coming out, your position requires a lot of reading into things and a lot of cynicism.>What makes me think he is guilty is the manor in which this has been handled - he has only come clean and released things as public scrutiny grows and impeachment support grows. You could easily see this as a person not cooperating with a group of people who are clearly out to get him. Or you could see it as someone who thinks this is a non-issue just not thinking he should have to let all the details out because he didn't do anything wrong. That's the whole reason he fired Comey, because Comey knew there was nothing and wouldn't simply say it.That article you posted just undercuts one thing he said, and people take a lot of stock in undercutting things Trump says when it leads nowhere. The media spends a lot of time undercutting things he has said that ultimately meant nothing, going all the way back to the size of his inauguration crowd. Trump says a lot of stuff, I'm not saying that's good, but it doesn't mean much.Why would the Ukraine say Biden did anything wrong either? If Trump loses to him, they still have a relationship to uphold. Biden is one of the strongest challengers.>The call was recorded as lasting 30 minutes, so we know the memo that was released was heavily tailored to be the least damaging version of events, and it was still pretty bad.Memcon's are never fully verbatim but are mostly verbatim. We frankly do not know what you claim we know, that it was highly tailored. You would have to assume the president had the power to adjust the memcon or that the people that did it were concerned with this conversation at the time the memcon was transcribed AND willing to redact the damning evidence you suggest is there.You can have the opinion that he is guilty, but that is a pretty big obstacle for him to get over. No one has cast any doubt on the integrity of it yet, and that would be an easy point the Dems could make, but they have not at all.Also, you need to have a real reason to investigate. The whistleblower will come in to talk with them. If there's nothing there, what more do you want? I'm all for transparency, but I'm not for fishing expeditions.People should still be innocent until proven guilty and investigations can't go on forever. Many things are possible, but nothing so far has shown what Schiff and the Dems are claiming. Ukraine has had a history of corruption and Biden has also talked about not giving them aid until they show they aren't corrupt. That isn't a quid pro quo, that is just being smart with taxpayer money. Why do you not assume this motive first when other leaders have done the same thing?What you say is possible, but you need proof. Your conjecture is only reasonable based on the assumption that Trump did indeed intend on a quid pro quo deal with Ukraine. The transcript isn't enough to prove that. It doesn't really exonerate the president, but it certainly doesn't prove the nefariousness they want to prove. The burden of proof is on the Democrats.What I want to know is why democrats think all these bogus leaks keep coming out? If this one is bogus, and it looks that way, this will be the 3rd for this president. I have never heard of this many leaks, especially completely bogus ones against a president. >what reforms he‚Äôs talking aboutThe "Utah Compact" is Left-wing propaganda which advocates amnesty. 1) Money is Fungible     What would happen if tomorrow the federal government sent half a billion     dollars to the Klu Klux Klan for subsidies to ‚Äúhelp the poor‚Äù so long as they    ‚Äúseparated their funds‚Äù from the group‚Äôs racist activities?

Still, I wouldn‚Äôt say you‚Äôre a libertarian. Wait, did they request the bailout or was it just disinformation? The source supports the original assertion. That‚Äôs absolutely correct. So long as they disclose it, everything is copacetic. Violating freedom of speech involves the utilization of state action to deter speech. Enforcing rules on a private Internet forum doesn‚Äôt fit that description, and it‚Äôs entirely the prerogative of the owners of that private community to so just that. I just prefer those types of rules be transparent. I was banned in late 2017. There are many more instances of right-leaning individuals being banned for taking relatively tame shots at the political left. You can find them on r/shitpoliticssays. >How can my premise be based on bad information if yours is entirely anecdotal and not even recent?

Seems like that‚Äôs really the political left‚Äôs shtick these days. If a policy measure leads to me having more control over how my money is spent versus the government, then that is indeed a small government policy measure.The entire purpose of pursuing smaller government is having the ability to make more voluntary decisions. >In order to get banned I had to wish another commenter and their family dies in an Obama dronestrike.This is somewhat misguided. It takes much, much less than that to be banned from r/politics. I was banned for making the joke ‚Äúthe left is always losing‚Äù a couple years back. My comment had received about 75 downvoted by the time a moderator stepped in to remove me from the community. Therefore, the entire premise of your point is based on bad information.

How exactly is decreasing the amount of income the federal government steals from us not a small government policy measure?Would having no income taxes also not be a small government policy measure? What I hear most from his supporters is that Bernie has been pushing the same ideas for the last 40 years, or that he doesn‚Äôt want to seize the means of production.

What if I‚Äôm healthy, and prefer to have the  most limited coverage offered, or I‚Äôm prone to getting sick and prefer to have maximum coverage? In a state-mandated system, I won‚Äôt have any choice.

You just get it. No questions asked.Right now, my employer pays a material portion of my healthcare premium. How would me footing the entire bill end up being cheaper? >I ballparked it. it looks about right.No, you‚Äôre making up data to support your positions. Don‚Äôt do that.  If we exclude all 2009 data, the average real GDP growth under the Obama Administration is 2.12%.The average real GDP growth rate for the current administration is 2.53%, materially higher than what it was under the previous administration. >IAREM, deficit and deficit/GDP ratio, job quality index, wealth and income inequality, business confidence, TI corruption index.Are these actually more material than GDP growth, wage growth, and unemployment? You‚Äôre also not citing specific numbers, which makes me dubious. For example, I know the job quality index has averaged higher under the Trump Administration compared to Obama‚Äôs post 2010.Regarding the deficit, that is one area that is objectively worse and a major cause of concern. Realistically though, it will never get better. The state would mandate roughly 150 million Americans to drop their private insurance plan and pay into the state-run plan. The entire industry is nationalized at this point, and private insurance companies will cease to exist. I just want you to explain to me how that is not authoritarian? Bernie advocates for banning private health insurance companies. Those companies would be mandated to shutdown by the force of the state.Could you explain how that isn‚Äôt authoritarian? The difference now is that we‚Äôre seeing higher GDP growth, higher wage growth, and lower unemployment. Worker‚Äôs wages are rising at the highest levels in a decade, and the middle class workers received a $1,000 tax cut. >GDP growth is the same as the post 2010 average, You literally made that up. There‚Äôs a material difference of around .4%. >The point is that, for a bunch of reasons, the US economy is in a less positive place than it used to beBy the most material metrics, it‚Äôs better. Can you cite the specific economic metrics where it has become less positive? Yes, and Bernie is extremely authoritarian on many issues.He has stated publicly he wants the state to nationalize entire industries of the U.S. economy. Bernie does advocate for the state to nationalize the entire healthcare industry, and has pushed for the nationalization of the energy sector in the past as well. Wanting to legalization marijuana doesn‚Äôt overshadow that. He is a leftist authoritarian. >Still not a mention of the deficit? You're avoiding that topic like the plague.The rising deficit is a trend that started under the previous Administration. I‚Äôm not a hack, though. So I will concede this Administration is fumbling on that issue.  >I love how you left off the sentences that followed:That is editorialized speculation from the WAPO. It was written last August, but now we know that wages materially rose throughout 2019. That is a fact, regardless of how you feel about it. To reiterate:>*For much of Obama‚Äôs time in office, wages remained subdued, and his economic team cited lackluster wager gains as the ‚Äúunfinished business‚Äù of his presidency.*>*Under Trump, average hourly pay has climbed and is **now growing more than 3 percent a year for the first time in more than a decade.***https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/08/20/trump-v-obama-economy-charts/Do you accept that wage rate growth under this Administration reached levels not seen in over a decade? >My point is that if people are willing to hold up a decrease in emissions as a positive for Trump despite the fact that he didn't have anything to do with itI cited the statistic to debunk the claim that Trump‚Äôs policies are actively hurting the environment.>then isn't it obvious that people will do this for all sorts of other things, like unemployment?This is much different, because there are tangible policy measures we can point to that directly affect unemployment, such as fiscal and regulatory policy. >Averages are meaningless without context. And the context is that his administration started during the largest depression since the "Great" one.Since the United States was in recession until the 3rd quarter of 2009, we can exclude all 2009 data from the average. This still places the average real GDP growth under the previous Administration at 2.12%.The average real GDP growth rate for the current administration is 2.53%, materially higher than what it was under the previous administration. >Uh, thanks Obama?We didn‚Äôt reach the record-breaking expansionary mark until two years into the current Administration. >These are both trends that started years before Trump took office. I don't see how you can look at charts and give Trump most of the credit. In fact, your "finally rising" claim is shown as false: they've been rising since the beginning of Obama's second term.While unemployment has dropped significantly under the current administration, wage growth is the one metric where it objectively trumps the previous administration:>*For much of Obama‚Äôs time in office, wages remained subdued, and his economic team cited lackluster wager gains as the ‚Äúunfinished business‚Äù of his presidency.*>*Under Trump, average hourly pay has climbed and **is now growing more than 3 percent a year for the first time in more than a decade***https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/08/20/trump-v-obama-economy-charts/ The government isn‚Äôt the cause for every positive progression in the world. Not by a long shot, actually. Pro-growth fiscal and regulatory policy isn‚Äôt ‚Äúmagical.‚Äù They‚Äôre free-market policy measures that remove bureaucratic red tape and allow businesses across different industries to focus on expanding. We are more than 10 years into the current expansionary period, the longest on record. The fact that the economy is suddenly growing at a faster rate this late into the cycle supports the assertion that the pro-growth policies put into place are doing what they were intended to. >Trumps policies are good if you like GDP more than people. It means nothing for quality of life, health, education, rural communities, and all the important shit.Don‚Äôt real wage growth and decreased middle class taxation count for ‚Äúpeople and important shit?‚Äù>And economies don‚Äôt suddenly snap to the economic policies of the sitting president.Yes, businesses do respond instantly to changes in fiscal and regulatory policy. It‚Äôs also an inconsistent position to criticize Trump‚Äôs economic policies, then immediately adopt the position of ‚Äòfiscal and regulatory policy doesn‚Äôt take effect until a decade later‚Äô when addressing with the positive statistics. The average GDP growth rate is actually higher under this Administration compared to its predecessor. You also have to take into account we are over 10 years into this expansionary cycle ‚Äî the longest expansionary cycle on record. The shift to higher GDP growth rates this late into the cycle is significant. Our national unemployment rate is at a 50 year low, and real wages are finally rising. I don‚Äôt see how you can overlook those statistics so confidently when you say ‚Äúthis economy is weak.‚Äù >This is not true. In 2016 the USA's IAREM (an economic management metric calculated using income, growth rate, median wealth, jobs, inflation, taxation, net government debt and economic freedom) ranking was 23rd. In 2018 it was 29th and last year it was 34th.Interesting, but has the GDP growth rate, real wage growth, or unemployment gotten worse under the current administration?>Also, the idea that trump is responsible for the current unemployment or GDP growth rate is ridiculous. GDP growth is pretty much bang on what it been floating around within a few points of for the last 30-40 years (apart from a couple recessions and booms), and the trend line for the unemployment rate hasnt changed since 2015.This strategy of bashing the economy under Trump, then resorting to ‚Äòfiscal and regulatory policy doesn‚Äôt take effect until a decade later‚Äô when grappling with the positive statistics is garbage. Carbon emissions decreased in 2019, but you‚Äôre correct that they did rise in 2018 compared to 2017. A more accurate statement would be that 2 out of the 3 years under the Trump Administration, US carbon emissions have decreased. By nearly every economic metric, the economy is superior under Trump compared to his predecessor. By nearly every economic metric, I‚Äôm referring to GDP growth rate, wage growth, and unemployment. US Carbon emissions are also decreasing annually under Trump. Just because you are unaware of the above facts, likely due to the media sources you use to shape your perspective of the world, does not mean they are invalid. I think you may be uninformed with regard to some of these statistics, and challenge you to refute the above facts. The question in this post is specifically framed as a compromise. Are you convinced it is not? >Nobody ever said it wasn't used. It wasn't the central part of the case, and when it was mentioned, it was footnoted as being funded by a rival campaign.Your above statement is false. We both know that. Will you concede you were making shit up? To address what you edited in:>And jesus - you really think that footnote doesn't indicate political opposition? "was looking for information to discredit the Trump campaign" perfectly fucking describes Free Beacon and the DNC.What you put in quotation marks was not the footnote. You‚Äôre a liar. >Glen Simpson's statements in his book, plus the statements you posted indicating that the Free Beacon-funded work drove them to investigate Russian links further.You keep making both of these statements up. You have no evidence or sources for either. >The genesis of the dossier - the information that led to Russia - was funded by the Free Beacon.You have no evidence of this.This all started from your claim that the footnote in the application stated the Dossier was funded by a rival campaign/political opposition. Do you accept the footnote did not say that? > I never said it was the same material. Yes, you said Fusion GPS has started the Dossier while working for the Free Beacon here:>And FusionGPS had been hired to produce opposition research prior to the DNC and Clinton campaign hiring them. **They started the dossier,** then went shopping for a new client when Free Beacon moved onThat was fake news. >The Russian leads were started from threads pulled on behalf of the Free Beacon.You have no evidence of this. Stop repeating this debunked line. >Which is why the FISA application that discusses the research being paid for by political opposition is abso-fucking-lutely the correct way to say "Republican and Democratic opposition".This is another line you have pulled out of your ass. You initially claimed the footnote on the application stated it was funded by a rival campaign. I debunked that, and will now debunk this. The footnote did not say it was funded by political opposition:>* Horowitz says a ‚Äúfootnote stated that Steele was hired by an identified U.S. person (Glenn Simpson) to conduct research regarding ‚ÄòCandidate # 1‚Äôs‚Äô (Donald Trump) ties to Russia and that the FBI ‚Äòspeculates‚Äô that this U.S. person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit the Trump campaign.‚Äù*>*Horowitz further states that ‚Äúthe FBI assumed, but did not know at the time of the first application, that Steele was conducting opposition research.‚Äù*>*In other words, it wasn‚Äôt even clear who specifically was funding Steele initially, even as the footnote made pretty clear the FBI believed this was intended to be derogatory information for political purposes.

You specifically claimed Fusion GPS compiled parts of the Dossier while conducting opposition research for the Washington Free Beacon.

So again, source your claim that Fusion GPS started the Steele Dossier for the Free Beacon, or concede that you are full of shit. You have specifically claimed the Steele Dossier was started by Fusion GPS when they were conducting opposition research for the Free Beacon, and they utilized their own Russian sources for the Dossier material. By all accounts, the Russian sources used for the Steele Dossier were strictly Steele‚Äôs sources:>*Fusion, in turn, subcontracted with Christopher Steele, a retired MI-6 officer with considerable expertise on Russian matters, **to use his contacts in Moscow to find what he could about Trump‚Äôs connections to the Russian government.

Do you understand this? The point I made is that the we only found how central the Dossier was the FISA applications over time.To reiterate, Schiff claimed the FISA application regarding Page‚Äôs 2016 activities narrowly used the Dossier. This is false, because the IG went on to say the FISA application regarding Page‚Äôs 2016 activities relied entirely on the Dossier. >What you've managed to do is ignore 3/4 of the reasons that Carter Page was being watched, then you've managed to claim that the only reason he was being watched was the dossier.The Dossier was central to the Carter Page FISA applications. That is the point I am making. From the IG:>*We determined that the Crossfire Hurricane team‚Äôs receipt of Steele‚Äôs election reporting on September 19, 2016 played a central and essential role in the FBI‚Äôs and Department‚Äôs decision to seek the FISA order*https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/12/13/vindication-nunes-memo/Also important to note the DOJ has ruled 2 of the FISA warrants against Carter Page invalid, and he was never charged with a crime. You also specifically claimed the footnote in the FISA applications stated the Dossier was funded by a rival campaign. The footnote did no such thing. Do you understand your statement was not true?>The dossier was not originally funded by the DNC. It was funded by the Washington Examiner, a conservative news outlet.This is another statement of yours that is demonstrably false. The DNC and Clinton campaign hired Fusion GPS in April of 2016.

Schiff did claim in 2018 the FBI made just narrow use of the Dossier regarding Carter Page‚Äôs 2016 campaign activities:  >*the DOJ cited multiple sources to support the case for surveilling Page but **made only narrow use** of information from Steele‚Äôs sources about Page‚Äôs specific activities in 2016, chiefly his suspected July 2016 meetings in Moscow with Russian officials.*The IG went on to assert last month that the FBI relied entirely on the Dossier regarding Carter Page‚Äôs 2016 campaign activities:>*At another point, Horowitz writes that the fourth element of the initial FISA application ‚Äî on Page‚Äôs alleged coordination with the Russian government related to the 2016 campaign ‚Äî **‚Äùrelied entirely on‚Äù** information from the Steele dossier.*https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/12/13/vindication-nunes-memo/Basically, how central the Dossier was to the FISA applications only slowly became known overtime. >It wasn't the central part of the case, and when it was mentioned, it was footnoted as being funded by a rival campaign.This is also false. Neither the DNC or Clinton campaign were explicitly named as funders of the Dossier:>*Horowitz further states that ‚Äúthe FBI assumed, but did not know at the time of the first application, that Steele was conducting opposition research.‚Äù*>*In other words, it wasn‚Äôt even clear who specifically was funding Steele initially, even as the footnote made pretty clear the FBI believed this was intended to be derogatory information for political purposes. The DNC and the Clinton campaign apparently weren‚Äôt named in later applications, though, and Horowitz lists that among the 17 errors and omissions by the FBI.*https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/12/13/vindication-nunes-memo/ Regarding your statement that the middle and lower class might struggle to survive due to the TCJA, the nonpartisan think tank Tax Policy Center claims that 82% of people making between 50k and 75k received tax cuts totaling $1,000. If you truly claimed 0 allowances, you should definitely not owe any taxes. You essentially provided the government with a large interest-free loan. I would double check your W4. >I doubt they were lying but I dont think it necessarily contradicts Schiff.Schiff explicitly claims there were no omissions of material information:> *FBI and DOJ officials did not abuse the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) process, omit material information,*Is Schiff lying when he states there were no material omissions?>I think it can be the case, that "narrow" information from the dossier was "relied on entirely". Again, the explicit details really matter here and we don't have those.Schiff explicitly claims that the Dossier itself was relied upon narrowly regarding Page‚Äôs 2016 campaign activities with Russian officials:>*made only narrow use of information from Steele‚Äôs sources about Page‚Äôs specific activities in 2016*This contradicts the IG, as you have read above. Was Schiff lying when he stated the FBI made narrow use of the Dossier on the single point of Page‚Äôs 2016 campaign activities regarding Russian officials? >Was the evidence that was exculpated, material evidence that was used for the application.The IG states the omissions were significant:>*We identified at least 17 **significant** errors or omissions in the Carter Page FISA application*Was the IG lying when he stated the omissions were significant?>Again, I feel like you are overlooking a distinction, Page's activities in 2016 and his activities in 2016 regarding Russia.There is no distinction. Both the IG and Adam Schiff are referring to Page‚Äôs specific activities in 2016 regarding Russian officials.Schiff‚Äôs statement:>*made only narrow use of information from Steele‚Äôs sources about **Page‚Äôs specific activities in 2016, chiefly his suspected July 2016 meetings in Moscow with Russian officials***The IG:> *the initial FISA application ‚Äî **on Page‚Äôs alleged coordination with the Russian government related to the 2016 campaign** ‚Äî ‚Äúrelied entirely on‚Äù information from the Steele dossier.*Was Schiff lying when he stated the FBI made narrow use of the Dossier on the single point of Page‚Äôs 2016 campaign activities regarding Russian officials? >I am questioning what exactly was exculpated.Below details the exculpatory evidence that was omitted:>‚ÄùThe FBI omitted the fact that Steele‚Äôs Primary Subsource, who the FBI found credible, had made statements in January 2017 raising significant questions about the reliability of allegations included in the FISA applications, including, for example, that he/she did not recall any discussion with Person 1 concerning Wikileaks and there was ‚Äònothing bad‚Äô about the communications between the Kremlin and the Trump team, and that he/she did not report to Steele in July 2016 that Page had met with Sechin.‚ÄùTo summarize, a Dossier key source told the FBI that Steele was lying about what he/she said. So, is the IG telling the truth that exculpatory evidence was omitted, or was Schiff telling the truth when he stated there were no omissions?>"relied entirely" **is used to describe a single point in the application.** So it can be used narrowly, and still be the sole source for a single point of argument.The single point is with regard to Page‚Äôs coordination with Russia related to the 2016 campaign.From the IG:>At another point, Horowitz writes that the fourth element of the initial FISA application ‚Äî on **Page‚Äôs alleged coordination with the Russian government related to the 2016 campaign ‚Äî ‚Äúrelied entirely on‚Äù information from the Steele dossier.**Schiff claims that single point, regarding Page‚Äôs 2016 campaign activities, relied narrowly on the Dossier:>made only **narrow use of information from Steele‚Äôs sources about Page‚Äôs specific activities in 2016,**Was Schiff lying when he stated the FBI made narrow use of the Dossier for Page‚Äôs 2016 campaign activities? >Which part exaclty?That primary sub source‚Äôs contribution to the Dossier. The IG designated it as exculpatory evidence. Are you claiming the IG is incorrect in that assessment?>No I am saying that they could both be correct. It could be used narrowly, while still being the only source one of the arguments. Really depends on the exact details. Which we dont have.The descriptors of ‚Äúcentral‚Äù and ‚Äúrelied entirely‚Äù are in conflict with ‚Äúused narrowly.‚Äù Do you agree with that statement? > Depends what the actual evidence was.The exculpatory evidence was essentially a primary sub source of the Dossier coming back to the FBI and stating it was bullshit. >It really depends on what the argument actually way, if could still be used narrowlyAre you arguing the Inspector General appointed by Obama was incorrect when he asserted that a FISA warrant relied entirely on the Dossier, and that Schiff was telling the truth? I‚Äôve provided examples above. You‚Äôre welcome to view for your own benefit. >Exculpatory evidence is relevant, but what exactly was the evidence,  people can disagree of what is exculpatory and what isn't.The FBI had received exculpatory evidence directly from a primary sub source of the Dossier, then withheld that evidence from 2 subsequent FISA applications. >But the second one says it was central "to their decision to seek the warrant" which is different than saying it was central to their argument in the warrant application itself, the fact that it does not say the latter implies to me that it wasnt the case, otherwise you would have posted that instead.Here‚Äôs another statement from the Inspector General that will help clear your dilemma:>At another point, Horowitz writes that the fourth element of the initial FISA application ‚Äî on Page‚Äôs alleged coordination with the Russian government related to the 2016 campaign ‚Äî ‚Äúrelied entirely on‚Äù information from the Steele dossier.https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/12/13/vindication-nunes-memo/Again, here is Schiff‚Äôs statement:>DOJ cited multiple sources to support the case for surveilling Page but made only narrow use of information from Steele‚Äôs sources about Page‚Äôs specific activities in 2016, The Dossier was central to obtaining the FISA warrant. Nunes and Schiff both knew this back in 2018, but Schiff explicitly lied about it. Do you agree that exculpatory evidence is relevant, or not?The purpose of the FISA application is a warrant. Both statements are regarding the application for a FISA warrant. The omitted information was exculpatory evidence, per the Inspector General‚Äôs report. Schiff taking the position that exculpatory evidence is irrelevant is absurd. He lied. Schiff also lied about the role the Dossier played in obtaining the FISA warrants:Schiff‚Äôs claim:>DOJ cited multiple sources to support the case for surveilling Page but **made only narrow use of information from Steele‚Äôs sources** about Page‚Äôs specific activities in 2016Nunes‚Äô claim:>The dossier ‚Ä¶ formed an **essential part** of the Carter Page FISA application.Inspector General appointed by Obama:>We determined that the Crossfire Hurricane team‚Äôs receipt of Steele‚Äôs election reporting on September 19, 2016 played a **central and essential role** in the FBI‚Äôs and Department‚Äôs decision to seek the FISA order,‚Äùhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/12/13/vindication-nunes-memo/ Adam Schiff deliberately lied to the American public about the Carter Page FISA warrant applications back in 2018. He and Devin Nunes both looked at the same underlying documentation, but only Nunes was honest about them. Schiff decided to lie about what he saw. For example:Schiff‚Äôs claim:>FBI and DOJ officials did not abuse the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) process, omit material information, or subvert this vital tool to spy on the Trump campaign. ‚Ä¶ DOJ met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis needed to meet probable cause requirement.‚ÄùNunes‚Äô claim: > In the case of Carter Page, the government had at least four independent opportunities before the FISC to accurately provide an accounting of the relevant facts. However, our findings indicate that, as described below, material and relevant information was omitted.‚ÄùInspector General appointed by Obama:>‚ÄùWe identified at least 17 significant errors or omissions in the Carter Page FISA applications, and many additional errors in the Woods Procedures,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúThese errors and omissions resulted from case agents providing wrong or incomplete information to [the Justice Department National Security Division‚Äôs Office of Intelligence] and failing to flag important issues for discussion.‚Äù https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/12/13/vindication-nunes-memo/Schiff is a partisan liar, and has a history of explicitly lying for political purposes. That qualifies as immortal. I think that‚Äôs a spot-on analysis, and the exact justification that would be used. >That's not remotely reasonable, considering how little respect cops as a whole have for constitutional rights.  It's basically their job to test how much courts will let them get away with.That‚Äôs probably fair. I added an edit, switching out ‚Äúmost‚Äù with ‚Äúsome.‚Äù>There would have to be gun-confiscation legislation passed first, and that sort of extreme policy isn't particularly close to mainstream Democratic policy.I‚Äôm not as optimistic. ‚ÄúAssault weapon‚Äù bans are certainly mainstream, and discounting misusage of firearm terminology, their voter base seems to be on board with such policy. I‚Äôm not sure I follow. What do you mean?**Edit:** So the Chief Justice appoints all FISA judges without confirmation or oversight, which is absolutely absurd. >And he'd probably do it anyway if it became law, unless you believe a career cop is going to give more of a shit about your rights than his job.  Fat chance.That is your preconceived conclusion. Law enforcement officers take an oath to uphold the Constitution, and it‚Äôs perfectly reasonable to assume some would in fact honor that oath. >I'd bet many, if not most, of the respondents don't know how expansive "semi-automatic" is -- you can find no shortage of surveys that suggest people believe all sorts of weird stuff.  If they did know how expansive that term is, that number would likely plummet. There‚Äôs no doubt many people are clueless when it comes to firearm terminology. This is especially evident in media coverage. For example, [this CNN journalist‚Äôs misunderstanding of what an automatic weapon is.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xMhZW6-B1T4)>Decades, then, assuming all subsequent appointees are as anti-gun as anyone who's ever been on the Supreme Court.Important to note, all Justices appointee by Democrats voted against Heller v DC which ruled the 2A provides an individual right to own firearms.Most of the candidates currently running for the Democratic nomination for President have pledged to increase the number of justices on the Supreme Court as well. This sort of infringement on our rights could theoretically happen after a year‚Äôs time. https://www.sfchronicle.com/nation/article/Democratic-candidates-propose-bigger-Supreme-14972607.php Since semi-automatic firearms account for such a significant portion of firearms, and are imperative to establishing a basic level of self defense, I believe that degree of regulation would be ruled a violation of the Second Amendment by the Supreme Court. I think for enactment to be feasible would require a significant shift to the ideological make-up of the Supreme Court. In a just world, the FISA courts would be abolished. The legal process of obtaining a warrant through the criminal courts is sufficient enough. If the state‚Äôs evidence does not meet a criminal court‚Äôs threshold, there should be no warrant granted. Simple as that. Unfortunately, there is currently no appetite within our political establishment to abolish FISA. I feel like that stems from a lack of proper awareness among the American population to what FISA is. The more awareness people get, presumably the more we would pressure politicians for change. >Illegal sellers outnumber legal and regulated businesses almost 3-to-1, according to a startling analysis of California cannabis sellers released this month>The sellers analysis, which was completed by an association of legal marijuana businesses in the state, ...https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-s-cannabis-black-market-has-eclipsed-its-legal-one-n1053856 He might be grandstanding, but I wouldn‚Äôt say there is nothing at stake. [57% of Americans support banning all semi-automatic weapons in the United States.](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/most-americans-support-stricter-gun-laws-new-poll-says) This would explicitly violate the Second Amendment, but has widespread support nonetheless. We‚Äôre only a few Supreme Court appointments away from seeing something like it implemented lawfully by the legislative branch. This is real. >Meanwhile experts estimate that black market marijuana vendors will bring in $8.7 billion in revenue in 2019, compared to $3 billion from legal sales.https://reason.com/2019/11/25/the-marijuana-black-market-will-keep-its-throne-in-california-thanks-to-tax-increases/The black market in California currently outnumbers the lawful market by 3 to 1. This is due to all the regulatory red tape that deters a properly sized supplier pool, and the excessive taxation placed on marijuana sales. Right, the DOJ is one of the primary departments under the executive branch. It certainly conflicts with the core principles of libertarianism, which are individualism and freedom of choice.Left libertarianism advocates for collective ownership of the means of production. This means private ownership of land and assets will be dissolved, which will require some degree of coercion and force ‚Äî private owners will not voluntarily cede ownership of assets they worked their entire lives for. The required coercion and force to achieve collective ownership is my biggest gripe with left libertarianism. I believe all libertarians should advocate for voluntary association and transactions, first and foremost. >The Justice Department inspector general last month criticized the FBI for a series of failures in its applications to the FISA court, including making statements that left an "inaccurate impression" and withholding potentially exculpatory information.>The report also accused a low-level FBI lawyer of **doctoring a document used to build the agency's application for FISA surveillance on Page.** The lawyer is now under criminal investigation, and has since resigned from the FBI.Not surprising in the least that the DOJ has declared these warrants as lacking sufficient predication. I believe there needs to be an entire overhaul to the FISA courts. They are only serving as a legal loophole to bypass our 4th amendment rights. No, that was merely a lie Cuomo used to justify his behavior. Cuomo has in fact used the word Fredo before, and a guest on his show recently used the word to describe Eric Trump. Cuomo did not bat an eye. >However he also criticized Sandmann by name ‚Äî saying he ‚Äúdid make a choice and that was to make it into a standoff.‚Äù>‚ÄùThat was not a good choice,‚Äù Cuomo said. ‚ÄúIf that was my son ‚Ä¶ would I like what he did?

If you insist you‚Äôre not sympathetic toward totalitarian communists, then I‚Äôll believe you. I just better see it reflected in your comments moving forward. I can understand why people might be concerned, but this discussion is centered around obsession. Obsession over the President is irrational. Here‚Äôs more detail to what I‚Äôm referring to:>Jennifer Panning, a psychologist from Evanston, Illinois, calls the phenomenon ‚ÄúTrump Anxiety Disorder.‚Äù She wrote a chapter on it in a collection by mental health experts called ‚ÄúThe Dangerous Case of Donald Trump.‚Äù In an interview, she said the disorder is marked by such symptoms as ‚Äúincreased worry, obsessive thought patterns, muscle tension and obsessive preoccupation with the news.‚Äùhttps://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/10/12/donald-trump-anxiety-disorder-pscyhologists-221305 It means I just told you you‚Äôre a leftist that holds sympathies with the Soviet Union. Yes, my post about the state abusing the FISA courts and altering or withholding exculpatory evidence to continue using it. I stickied it myself. I‚Äòll being voting GOP because the Republican Party is the one party within our effective two-party system that advocates for decentralized government, free-market principles, and individualism.The Democrats on the other hand advocate for collectivism and centralized government. For example, they support the banning of the private insurance industry, banning private ownership of semi-automatic firearms, and raising taxes for the purpose of ‚Äúequality.‚Äù Why should I not do everything in my power to ensure they‚Äôre the ones that don‚Äôt take power? Come make me, you little tankie. I struck a nerve, clearly. You don‚Äôt have to share if you don‚Äôt want to, but have you started therapy since Trump‚Äôs Presidency? It was the third community listed under your active communities. I just don‚Äôt really care enough to dig any deeper than that into your profile. Regardless, I‚Äôm sure I advocate for individualism and free markets more than you. You‚Äôll probably be voting Bernie in the Dem primaries. You all are great liars, I‚Äôll give you that. The word obsession was specifically used, not ‚Äútalk about.‚Äù Do you understand the difference between the two? I can explain it to you, if needed. No one on the right is obsessed is Greta, but many leftists are absolutely obsessed with Trump. So much so, they‚Äôre seeing therapists because of it:>Donald Trump is in the therapy room and he is blowing it up. Counselors, clinicians, and life coaches report that their clients are showing up with exacerbated experiences of ‚Äúparanoia, hypervigilance, anxiety, depression, intrusive thoughts, somatic complaints, difficulty concentrating and sleeping, and nightmares.‚Äù The therapists aren‚Äôt exempt, either; some say they just can‚Äôt stop thinking about Trump.https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/living-single/201806/what-s-trump-doing-in-your-therapy-room You support adding leftist judges to the courts to overturn Heller v DC. Why don‚Äôt you man up, and come take everyone‚Äôs guns yourself? You post in /politics, tf are you doing in a sub that advocates for individualism and free markets? You literally defended the Soviet Union right after you typed this.https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/et5wl4/communism/ffexl89/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfThis sub, lmao..

Wage growth is finally reaching pre-great recession levels since Trump took office. https://www.frbatlanta.org/chcs/wage-growth-trackerWages tend grow as the labor market gets tight, and these past couple of years are no exception. This is the benefit of low unemployment. Okay tankie. I‚Äôm more libertarian than you‚Äôll ever be, jabroni. Best of luck to you as well, comrade. Don‚Äôt project your feelings towards comrade Bernie on me now. You‚Äôre an actual Marxist. Your opinion will never matter. This is by far the most statist sub I comment on, and its name is libertarian...Yes, the statists are gonna win. I‚Äôm sure he obsesses over her a lot less than you all do over Trump. Gotcha, you‚Äôre a legitimate troll. Please do not respond to my comments going further. Is there a criminal statute included in the impeachment articles against Trump?If you don‚Äôt know the answer, that‚Äôs fine. You do not have to respond to my comments regarding this. Name the statute or fuck off. Simple as that.I understand you‚Äôre some random little leftist attacking me for rejecting the claim that there‚Äôs a statute in the impeachment articles. Prove me wrong. Lazy troll. Just name the statute included in the impeachment articles since you know it. How hard is that? Cite the statute you little leftist. Cite the specific statute used in the impeachment articles then you little leftist. I mean you all are wrong about pretty much everything these days, this is another one of those things. >Contempt of Congress is a misdemeanor crime under U.S. law, which defines the offense as willfully failing to provide testimony or documents to Congress. A different crime, obstruction of justice, more broadly prohibits ‚Äúinterference with the orderly administration of law and justice.‚Äùhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment-charges-factbox-idUSKBN1ZK0GDThe above are both statutory crimes. Obstruction of Congress is not. I encourage you to read more into this topic and perhaps you can be convicted that Obstruction of Congress is not a statutory crime. Lmao, you‚Äôre an idiot. So Obstruction of Congress is a statutory crime, correct? So wait, they don‚Äôt cite specific statutes? The Democrats did not cite a specific statute in the impeachment articles.You are full of shit. Why didn‚Äôt the Democrats cite the statute‚Äôs code, 18 USC 1505? I understand no specific crimes have to be included in impeachment articles. /u/retardican_president is claiming that specific statutes were included in the impeachment articles. We both know that is not true, but why should he be able to spread lies and have his community buddies rush to attack me for calling it out?Let‚Äôs just be honest with one another, even with the ones that are on our ‚Äúside.‚Äù >They wrote the articles of impeachment to be easy for the average voter to understand. That‚Äôs why they chose not to cite a bunch of US Codes.I agree that‚Äôs partially why. Another reason was to dampen the defense‚Äôs ability to combat the  charges due to the overall vagueness. You are a liar. The 2nd article is called Obstruction of Congress, not Obstruction of proceedings before departments, agencies, and committees. Source: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/20/what-are-trump-articles-of-impeachment There is no crime specifically called Obstruction of Congress. You are spreading more lies to save face. 18 U.S.C 1505 - Obstruction of proceedings before departments, agencies, and committees, is not called Obstruction of Congress. It is also not cited in the Article of Impeachment. How you follow politics but aren‚Äôt aware the impeachment articles include no specific statutory crimes is beyond me. This has been covered extensively because you actually don‚Äôt need to include specific crimes.You likely have realized it by now, but refuse to admit it because you‚Äôre a piece of shit and a liar. That 10 year old article addresses **obstruction of justice.** The current Articles of Impeachment do not include obstruction of justice. You are mistaking Trump‚Äôs impeachment with Bill Clinton‚Äôs. Quote the section from the **current** articles of impeachment that cites a statutory crime, or concede you are a liar. No, that 10 year old article addresses obstruction of justice. Read your own quote. The Articles of Impeachment do not include obstruction of justice. You are mistaking Trump‚Äôs impeachment with Bill Clinton‚Äôs. >That's been done for you, multiple timesYou have not quoted where in the Articles of Impeachment that a statutory crime is cited. Stop lying. You quoted a 10 year old article about obstruction of justice. Either quote the section from the article of impeachment that cites a statutory crime, or concede you were wrong. Abuse of power itself is not a statutory crime. Can you cite where in that article of impeachment though where a statutory crime is cited? That‚Äôs a 10 year old article that is describing **obstruction of justice.** Take your upvotes from the mindless brigade here, but Articles of Impeachment do not include obstruction of justice. You‚Äôre thinking of Bill Clinton‚Äôs impeachment. I want you to cite where in the Articles of Impeachment against Donald Trump that a statute is cited. Hahaha, I see you‚Äôre clearly the intellectual type. I‚Äôm 25 by the way, you little jabroni. What‚Äôs wrong guy? Can‚Äôt explicitly articulate your point? You must realize it‚Äôs not a strong one. Dude, can you articulate a sentence that describes what you actually mean? Required for what exactly? Removal? Explain to me what I ‚Äúheavily implied‚Äù because it‚Äôs not clear. Quote me where I said there must me a statute. You won‚Äôt, because you literally made it up. I am merely calling out all the misinformation in this sub, and the claim that statutory crimes were included in the impeachment articles is misinformation, whether you people like it or not. Again, the Articles of Impeachment themselves are not a statutory crime. You said statutory crimes are included in them. Cite the statutory law. Articles of Impeachment are not statutory laws. I want you to cite the statutory crimes that were included. Again, here is your quote:>He was, both articles or (sic) impeachment include crimesCite the statute, or concede you are wrong. Here is an exact quote from you:>He was, both articles or (sic) impeachment include crimesWhy can you not cite the statutory crimes included? Why can you not find a single source to support your assertion that the articles of impeachment contained a statutory crime? We‚Äôre actually gonna stay focused on your claim. You made the assertion that the articles of impeachment contained statutory crimes, yet you cannot cite a single source supporting that assertion. This is because you are spreading bullshit. Stop making claims you cannot backup with evidence. I am familiar with them both, and they in fact cite no statutory crime. That is an absolute fact. If you disagree, please feel free to cite the statutory crime. Can you cite the statutes of the crimes, or did the articles of impeachment just not include statutory crimes? >Wrong. Evidence will be automatically admitted unless Trump team objects. An objection from the Trump team triggers a Senate vote. No, this was changed and you‚Äôre citing dated articles. All evidence from the House record has been admitted. It‚Äôs subpoenas for witnesses and *new* documents that will rely on a vote after opening arguments.>It allows Republicans to block witnesses and evidence during the day when no one is watching.I told you your bullshit will be called out in this sub. Stop parroting the same debunked shit over and over. The process for calling witnesses is the exact same as the Clinton trial. There will be a vote to call them *after* opening arguments, just as it was during the Clinton trial. Stop claiming this is some new tactic manufactured by the GOP. Only it‚Äôs in his personal yearbook section, and he admitted to it initially. Who admits something they didn‚Äôt do? He only lied once he realized he wouldn‚Äôt be held accountable. >‚ÄùI am deeply sorry for the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo and for the hurt that decision caused then and now,‚Äù Ralph Northam, the Democratic governor, said in a statement on Friday evening.No shocker you excuse his behavior. You‚Äôre a Democrat. Democrats look after their own. >Evidence will be submitted from the House impeachment inquiry, but McConnell gave the Trump team the power to object to the admission of evidence, This is horseshit. According to ABC, all evidence from the House inquiry is automatically included in the Senate trial:>McConnell also agreed to have evidence from the House inquiry automatically admitted as evidence in the Senate trial.https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-impeachment-trial-live-updates-senate-rejects-democrats/story?id=68410003Regarding your claim on there not being witnesses, the process for calling witnesses is the exact same as the Clinton trial. There will be a vote to call witnesses after opening arguments. Each side having 24 hours for opening arguments is how it was during the Clinton trial. The difference with the period being confined to 3 days is negligible. >Cause it‚Äôs their choice to resign? You can call for their resignation, but their resignation is ultimately their choice.If the Democrats held their own accountable, actual party leaders would step up and request he step down. The DNC could disown him altogether as well. >Northam admitted that he wore blackface, he apologized for his past behavior,This is easily debunked. Northam retracted his confession and denied it was him. He did so because he knew his party would not hold him accountable. His last statement regarding his blackface picture is denial of it. >That same party is trying to prevent evidence and witnesses from being presented in the trial. They‚Äôre literally trying to get away with holding a show trial. I want you to realize the trial is being carried out under the same process as the Clinton Senate trial. If there‚Äôs a difference you can point out, I‚Äôd love to hear it! Drop your whataboutisms. You stated above the Democrats held their own accountable, but neither Ralph Northam or Justin Fairfax came close to resigning last year. Why were they not held accountable? Here‚Äôs your argument:>Democrats hold their own accountable. I called your bullshit argument out, and debunked it. That‚Äôs not whataboutism. Do you now concede that Democrats in fact do not hold their own accountable? >Democrats hold their own accountable. The Governor of Virginia, Ralph Northam wore blackface and was pictured doing so in a yearbook. Did Democrats push him to resign? No.While the above was going on, the Lieutenant Governor, Justin Fairfax was credibly accused of sexual assault. Did Democrats push him to resign? No. Your comment is false bullshit designed to shield the Democrats‚Äô true behavior and provide their supporters with false morality. This isn‚Äôt /politics. You‚Äôre going to get your bullshit called out in this sub. >Difference here is that republicans , the corrupt ones, are blocking all testimonies.I just told you that voting to call witnesses takes place after opening arguments, just as it did for the Clinton trial. That is a fact. Cite your evidence that the Senate will vote to not call any witnesses, or concede that you only talk out of your ass and are uninformed. Debunk my assertion. I‚Äôm daring you to try. You have no substance. What‚Äôs sad is uninformed individuals like you and OP actually vote. I‚Äôm not even the original commenter, look at the usernames you‚Äôre responding to. You don‚Äôt have any substance here. You‚Äôre clearly uninformed on this topic, so back down from this debate. Right, you don‚Äôt know shit. Just like OP. >He's basing his statement of the current understanding presented by most of the media.Get the fuck out of here. You guys will parrot MSNBC talking points all day but can‚Äôt back them up. Typical left-wing Redditor. The Clinton trial provided each side with 24 hours of opening arguments, which is exactly the case for the Trump trial. In the Clinton trial, votes were then cast to call certain witnesses. The Senate voted to not allow Monica Lewinsky to testify at the trial, for example. The same vote to call witnesses will happen in the Trump trial after opening arguments. Then we will have closing arguments then a vote. It‚Äôs the same schedule.Alright now, articulate how it‚Äôs different? Right on cue, too. These fuckers never disappoint. He‚Äôs the one that created the god damned post making this statement. Why should OP not have to articulate his position?The lack of common sense and partisan ignorance in this sub is too much sometimes. Have some fuckin‚Äô shame. Yes, because I‚Äôm informed and able to construct sentences to backup my assertions, unlike /u/DvaProBro.I‚Äôm also not the one that created a post on this, yet left-wingers nonetheless rush to support his ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not defending my position‚Äù statement.Anyways, the Clinton trial provided each side with 24 hours of opening arguments, which is exactly the case for the Trump trial.

It‚Äôs very real, and always amusing to see materialize in real time. > OP posts in /thenewright >Posts ‚Äúproof‚Äù showing OP made one comment there in 2018 to debunk a Sandy Hook conspiracy theory.Yup, lying sack of shit. No, I actually describe myself as a libertarian-leaning conservative. The Republican Party is the one party within our two-party system that advocates for decentralized government, free-market principles, and individualism.The Democrats advocate for collectivism and centralized government. For example, they support the banning of the private insurance industry, banning private ownership of semi-automatic firearms, and raising taxes for the purpose of ‚Äúequality.‚ÄùThe lies people like you propagate here is nothing short of amusing. That is what you support. You are the advocate for authoritarianism. You are a partisan Democrat, don‚Äôt lie.You also know you don‚Äôt support the libertarian principles I mentioned above. We see through your charade. You‚Äôre an actual authoritative leftist, much further from a pure libertarian than I am.I at least support free markets, decentralized government, and individual liberties. Your little leftist ass can‚Äôt say any of that. Yes, you are lying sack of shit. You said I post there, as in I frequent that community. I made a single comment there a while ago to debunk a Sandy Hook conspiracy theory. >But now I'm a troll because you only posted there once and deleted it, because it was so unpopular it got 34 upvotes.I didn‚Äôt delete anything. Here‚Äôs the comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheNewRight/comments/9t4l9w/just_one_example/e8tuezb?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2xYou are a despicable troll for attacking me because I called out someone for spreading a Sandy Hook conspiracy theory. Wow, I made a single comment in that sub sometime in 2018 to debunk a Sandy Hook conspiracy theory. Out of all of my comment history stretching back 3 and half years, you try to reduce me to that sub because I commented there once to debunk a Sandy Hook conspiracy theory?Comment in question: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheNewRight/comments/9t4l9w/just_one_example/e8tuezb?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2xYou are a damper on this community, and a very lazy troll. >But the default assumption should not be that it is an accurate representation of the conversation, **because with this guy it rarely is**I just don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve substantiated that claim with your Media Matters article and 11 year old New Times Article. Right, vague accusations from Media Matters and mainstream media outlets that he takes his targets out of context by selectively editing their statements. I guess you can believe this Bernie staffer was taken out of context. There‚Äôs definitely nothing wrong with being skeptical of O‚ÄôKeefe, he definitely is a partisan. Why aren‚Äôt you citing links? Those are very sketchy accusations considering you can‚Äôt even cite their source. You‚Äôre a lying sack of shit. Post a link to a comment of mine on thenewright, you little  lying leftist troll. I mean, the mainstream media makes vague accusations that he edits his undercover clips. Do you have any evidence at all that this Bernie staffer was taken out of context? Just because you‚Äôre a leftist and perhaps sympathetic towards Gulags as well, doesn‚Äôt mean this expos√© of Bernie‚Äôs campaign staffers is trash. Socialists/communists managed to take control of that sub a while ago. A lot of them will claim to be libertarian. It‚Äôs unfortunate, but speaks to how so many on the left thrive for control. Right? Freedom of expression gives people the right to criticize others for their actions. Seems many on the political left cannot grasp that. Something tells me you‚Äôre wrong and just trying to save face for them. Clearly they were not referring to farmers and defense contractors when they said ‚Äúcorporations.‚Äù When you say welfare, do you mean corporations keeping more of the money they earned?If so, you have a fundamental misunderstanding of what welfare is. I‚Äôd rate her run a success considering how much PR she received from the debates. She definitely will make a lot of money from this. They love being spoon-fed propaganda. Some are just lost causes my friend. I feel like some in this sub may living in an alternative reality. By all measures, Iranian aggression has momentarily been deterred, and the Trump administration has advocated for diplomatic talks. I can honestly say each time you comment, it only reaffirms your ineptitude. I‚Äôll gladly end this here. Do you concede that Iran preemptively alerted us of the strike in order to ensure no US casualties?>Both sides are at fault here, but we started it and they escalated.This is misinformation, but I‚Äôd like to know your response to the above before engaging any further. Iran has increasingly escalated the severity of their attacks within the past year, between attacking Saudi oil fields, attacking oil tankers in the strait of Hurmoz, and taking down a US drone. The US showed nothing but restraint in response to the above attacks, so Iran escalated further to killing a US contractor at the end of 2019. The repeated escalation above is what led to the United States targeting Soleimani for purposes of deterring their aggression. So far, it has worked. They preemptively alerted Iraqi and US forces of the strike in order to ensure no casualties. That is subsided aggression considering they had just killed an American contractor and attacked our Embassy. You‚Äôre simply arguing in bad faith by citing the downing of the commercial airline as retaliation. It was done to prevent war. Below is the definition of deterrence, since you don‚Äôt seem to grasp it:>the action of discouraging an action or event through instilling doubt or fear of the consequences.Thus far, Iranian aggression has subsided. The Administration has made it clear that targeting Soleimani was done for purposes of deterrence. So far, it‚Äôs a strategy that seems to be working. He was a uninformed General in a combat zone, and was engaged in hostilities against the US. At what point is acceptable to target him?Edit: Nvm, you don‚Äôt even believe he‚Äôs affiliated with Iran‚Äôs proxy militias. This is a pointless debate. The left mostly has to save face with regard to the Obama-era foreign policy towards Iran, but also they simply cannot concede an inch to this President under any circumstance. How does banning the private insurance industry, banning private ownership of semi-automatic firearms, and raising taxes equate more rights for us compared to the present moment?The lies people like you propagate here is nothing short of amusing. You‚Äôre a liar. All of the top comments in the r/conservative post are calling for anti-war efforts. As I became more informed of the effects of a centralized government and how historically those systems have failed, I became more libertarian. I also worked hard through college, and became an avid gym goer around the same time. Both of those led me to be placing merit as the top qualifier for success and wealth. One the favorite of this sub, AOC. This isn‚Äôt going to go over well. Yeah, you‚Äôre a great example of how informed the average response within this post is. Laughable. The current caretaker PM is still the PM that caused massive protests because of Iran‚Äôs influence over him. He has not yet stepped down from his position. Do you have any evidence that the US intelligence stating Iran‚Äôs involvement is false, outside of Iran‚Äôs public statements? The Iraqi PM is resigning over Iraqi pressure because of Iran‚Äôs explicit influence over him. You can save this Iranian propaganda horseshit for someone else. Yes, Iraq is indeed a combat zone. The total land area of Iraq has been designated a combat zone by the Unites States for many years. The United States government has stated it was Iran-backed proxy militias behind the rocket attack that killed a US contractor, and the storming of the US embassy last week. These proxy militias *were* commanded by Soleimani.How exactly have you been sold on the Iranian propaganda that Soleimani wasn‚Äôt such a bad guy, and not directly involved with these proxy militias across the region? Soleimani was a uniformed general in a conflict zone, engaged in hostilities against the United States and its interests./u/harumph, at what point does it become okay for Soleimani to be a legitimate target? >Not versus inflation it isn't, lolReal wages have been consistently rising. You should try staying more informed with current events:>From November 2018 to November 2019, real average hourly earnings increased 1.7 percent, seasonally adjusted. https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/realer.pdf Can you cite a source that shows poverty rates within the US rising?You can‚Äôt, because it‚Äôs bullshit:>The official poverty rate in 2018 was 11.8 percent, down 0.5 percentage points from 12.3 percent in 2017. This is the fourth consecutive annual decline in poverty. Since 2014, the poverty rate has fallen 3.0 percentage points, from 14.8 percent to 11.8 percent.https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2019/demo/p60-266.html Don‚Äôt you oppose the second amendment?I‚Äôm curious because most people I see making the claim that Trump opposes gun rights are actually opponents of the second amendment themselves. Wouldn‚Äôt that mean your true motive is in pursuing the facts of his alleged crimes? The two positions are pretty unambiguous considering they are framed as binary. Are the Democrats pursing impeachment in an apolitical fashion in order to find legitimate wrongdoing, or are they motivated by the partisanship in wanting Trump taken out of office by any means.The Democrats have been careful in how they describe impeachment, using words such as solemn and somber. Most people seeing through that is the essence of the above polling data. Please save these comments for r/politics. Polling data suggests most voters already believed the Democrats‚Äô motive was political, and this move by House Democrats will surely only expand that belief:>When asked about congressional Democrats' motivation, a third of Americans say they tried to follow the facts "wherever they might lead," and 59% say they were more interested in finding ways to take down Trump.https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/12/11/trump-impeachment-poll-monmouth-university/4397931002/ The Republican Senate in 2013?

My comment agreed with you. Trends is what is seemingly going right over your head. I‚Äôll explain:The labor force participation rate decreased by 2.8 points from the beginning to the end of Obama‚Äôs Presidency. This decrease was constant each year. Thus far, **it has incrementally increased each year** throughout the Trump Presidency. See the data in the page cited below. https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000 Looking at the chart, from the January 2009 starting point of 65.7, the labor force participation rate consistently decreased throughout Obama‚Äôs Presidency. It has only started it‚Äôs trend of increasing during the Trump administration. The entire facet of your argument ironically makes the Trump economy look stronger. You‚Äôre commenting in bad faith. I‚Äôve told you 3 times the number you cited was materially inaccurate. The labor participation rate hasn‚Äôt been as low as 60 percent since the 1970s.You stating it‚Äôs worse now than it was under Obama is false. The rate was at 65.7 percent in January 2009, at the start of Obama's presidency, and was at 62.7 percent the month Obama left officeThe labor participation rate today is 63.20 percent. It has **increased** since Trump took office. No, you diminishing the 50-year low unemployment rate by citing a materially understated labor force participation rate is deceptive.Especially considering the current 63.20 percent labor force participation rate is actually higher than the 50 year average. The current labor participation rate as of September 2019 is 63.20 percent, so your statistic is incorrect. The current labor participation rate is actually higher than the average of 62.99 percent from 1950 until 2019.https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/labor-force-participation-rate You will be very hard pressed to find an economist that states regulatory and fiscal policy will not have an effect on the economy until multiple years of being in place. That‚Äôs because such a statement is very ignorant and likely comes from a partisan motive. Pro-growth deregulatory and fiscal policy. Those two policy measures when done correctly are generally always going to grow the economy.

Many US allies called for the removal of Shokin and Biden actions were justifiedThere being a few other Western leaders opposed to Shokin doesn‚Äôt negate there being a conflict of interest for Joe Biden. As I said above, Viktor Shokin testified in a sworn affidavit that he was fired as a direct result of  ‚Äúintense pressure from Joe Biden and the U.S. administration.‚Äù That doesn‚Äôt prove it, but it‚Äôs ignorant to claim this is a debunked story.

I‚Äôll try to explain one last time. Paraphrasing him with ‚ÄúI need you to do me a favor and investigate Biden‚Äù manipulates the transcript by adding more significance to Trump‚Äôs Biden request. It‚Äôs just another example of shady media reporting. You could read the article.

That doesn‚Äôt signal a lack of support for minorities owning guns. Those districts still were solidly Democratic 50 years ago, and up until the 1990s. So is it a good standard to argue those districts represent who Democrats are today, just as many in this sub argue the NRA‚Äôs stances in the 1960s represent them today?You cannot have it both ways. And they are wrong to say that speaks to the contemporary stances of Democrats. So if you don‚Äôt have healthcare, you want to take my money to pay for it? That‚Äôs freedom, you little leftist? If our standards are to look to events 50 years ago in order to make a statement on contemporary politics, you‚Äôll have to also argue Democrats stand against the 1964 Civil Rights Act since most of the opposition to bill came from them. Or instead just form a bureaucracy that can point a gun at them and coerce them to do as I want. If the United States isn‚Äôt number one, the list is biased. Those are just the facts my socialist friend. They‚Äôre ranked 3 overall, and ranked higher than the United States on ‚Äúhuman freedom.‚Äù The list is flawed. Being a leftist means your interpretation of words such as freedom has little to do with the widely-agreed upon meaning. While it‚Äôs defined as an ‚Äúabsence of subjection to foreign domination or despotic government,‚Äù a leftist instead would define it as as the presence of subjection to governmental authority, for the greater good of humanity, or whatever. Hong Kong is number 3 on the list you‚Äôre referring to, so you‚Äôre right they‚Äôre not number one. They do also rank higher than us on ‚Äúhuman freedom.‚Äù He‚Äôs a leftist. You have to understand his perspective of freedom is very different from its definition. I highly encourage anyone who sees this graph‚Äôs placement of the New York Times as ‚Äúunbiased‚Äù and ‚Äúoriginal factual reporting‚Äù go check out the recent transcript of the town hall between its executive editor and their employees.The editor states they will never again make the mistake of reporting the facts of what Trump says, but rather what they believe he means in his heart. They also admit they have to shift their portrayal of the President to ‚Äúracism‚Äù now that the Mueller investigation ended without a payoff for Trump critics.It is absolutely fascinating. >All but two Democratic presidential hopefuls backed a proposal to decriminalize unauthorized border crossings on the second night of the first 2020 Democratic debatehttps://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5d15884ee4b03d6116392906?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHnQtSFVyhaTAYd0B4Wh93ezXO4exNicbbKqve9AoD6oPlontj-aYhaKY_JOvVroQD0rK6prdyGSF4Wg4KeFua397QaCHDDKrrpTPl75bXjnF7N_qAayGARxCp0KAR2q7hnpIzQsidmu-N_xgD6Fne2gJMKpS5-S7_km3eKZmz5k>Almost all of the 19 candidates who responded to a recent New York Times survey on health care positions said ‚Äúyes‚Äù to a question about whether undocumented immigrants should be covered under a ‚ÄúMedicare for all‚Äù systemhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/03/health/undocumented-immigrants-health-care.html No, many Democrats running for President support the government not having any check on those that make it into our borders, then go on to support supplying taxpayer-funded healthcare to every last one of them.That is much, much more radical.

Your link describes doxing as: >search for and publish private or identifying information about (a particular individual) on the Internet, typically with malicious intent.Notice how it says private or identifying information.

A migrant can make a claim for asylum after being caught unlawfully crossing the border, but that asylum claim does not grant immunity for their federal law violation. In fact, this is exactly what has been happening. See the Trump Administration‚Äôs zero tolerance policy for more context. Thanks for asking for more context, I‚Äôm always happy to educate. The statute is Title 8, Section 1325 of the U.S. Code if anyone is interested in further reading.>The immigration law actually uses the term "improper entry," which has a broad meaning. It‚Äôs more than just slipping across the U.S. border at an unguarded point. Improper entry can include:>entering or attempting to enter the United States at any time or place other than one designated by U.S. immigration officers (in other words, away from a border inspection point or other port of entry)https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/us-immigration/crime-enter-illegally.html >Cutting our immigration in half is not reasonable.

It seems your argument is based on emotion while labeling your opponents argument as being emotional.I really don‚Äôt think you understand what an emotional appeal is in this context. It is a fact that Democrats are campaigning on providing taxpayer-funded healthcare to all illegal immigrants:>Almost all of the 19 candidates who responded to a recent New York Times survey on health care positions said ‚Äúyes‚Äù to a question about whether undocumented immigrants should be covered under a ‚ÄúMedicare for all‚Äù systemhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/03/health/undocumented-immigrants-health-care.htmlMedicare for all is already a expensive entitlement plan. Adding all illegal immigrants as beneficiaries to that entitlement will only make it more so, especially while advocating for decriminalizing unlawful border crossings and pledging to only deport illegal immigrants that commit crimes.These policy measures are not sustainable because taxing the rich and middle class can only get you so far. That‚Äôs referring to his ‚ÄúBORING‚Äù tweet during the first Democratic debate. It‚Äôs a stretch to claim that was in reference to dying migrants. Here‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs response in that Reuter‚Äôs link:>‚ÄùIf they fixed the laws you wouldn't have that. People are coming up, they're running through the Rio Grande," he said, referring to the river known as the Rio Bravo in Mexico that forms a large part of the border between the two countries.>‚ÄùThey can change it very easily so people don't come up, and people won't get killed," Trump told reporters.‚ÄúBoring‚Äù isn‚Äôt mentioned, so were you confused? Try providing the link yourself where he calls this boring. I honestly believe you are reading fake news. Can you source where he called ‚Äúdying, detained people‚Äù boring? Emotionally, we should. Logically, there has to be a reasonable cap. It‚Äôs also an emotional appeal when Democrats campaign on providing taxpayer-funded healthcare to all illegal immigrants.In a world where economic stability doesn‚Äôt matter, I agree with all of that. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Source? Can you name one single country on the planet that takes in more immigrants per year than the United States? No, you cannot. Be glad we take in so many immigrants, more than any country in the world, but keep in mind we have to be logical about it as well. According to Title 8, Section 1325 of the U.S. Code, crossing our border between ports of entry is unlawful. While Democrats are actively campaigning on decriminalizing it, right now it is indeed unlawful. Laws are also made by Congress. Trump is not the one that made unlawful border crossings a thing. For the sake of informing others, I‚Äôm going to cite sources for every last statement in my previous comment.‚ÄúDemocrats are now advocates of de facto open borders by decriminalizing illegal immigration‚Äù>All but two Democratic presidential hopefuls backed a proposal to decriminalize unauthorized border crossings on the second night of the first 2020 Democratic debatehttps://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5d15884ee4b03d6116392906?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHnQtSFVyhaTAYd0B4Wh93ezXO4exNicbbKqve9AoD6oPlontj-aYhaKY_JOvVroQD0rK6prdyGSF4Wg4KeFua397QaCHDDKrrpTPl75bXjnF7N_qAayGARxCp0KAR2q7hnpIzQsidmu-N_xgD6Fne2gJMKpS5-S7_km3eKZmz5k‚Äúsupport tax payer funded healthcare for illegal immigrants‚Äù>Almost all of the 19 candidates who responded to a recent New York Times survey on health care positions said ‚Äúyes‚Äù to a question about whether undocumented immigrants should be covered under a ‚ÄúMedicare for all‚Äù systemhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/03/health/undocumented-immigrants-health-care.html‚Äúpro slavery reparations‚Äù>So far, several candidates have expressed some level of support for reparations: Sens.

This information also really isn‚Äôt for you, it‚Äôs for the open-minded that want to be informed on the current political landscape.For fun you can try to cite sources that back up your statements. We both know by now that isn‚Äôt going to happen though. You need to keep up with the debates and stay informed. Democrats are now advocates of de facto open borders by decriminalizing illegal immigration, support tax payer funded healthcare for illegal immigrants, pro slavery reparations, and support the governmental banning of private insurance companies.These are all radical positions that have without question been responsible for Trump reaching his highest polling numbers yet this week. What did you literally watch him say? That‚Äôs about the level of intellect I expected. Thanks for the response. There‚Äôs a discrepancy between what the YT reporter claims Trump said, versus what was actually said.Rewatch the gif, and tell me if you can recognize it. The Trump supporter is correct. Trump didn‚Äôt say he could get away with it. He said he wouldn‚Äôt lose any voters. Do you understand the difference? Why can‚Äôt anybody vote for you? The Constitution doesn‚Äôt prohibit the incarcerated from running for office. I‚Äôm glad you at least tried using logic, but the YT reporter is nonetheless lying about what was said. The Trump supporter is correct. Trump didn‚Äôt say he could get away with it. He said he wouldn‚Äôt lose voters over it. Do you understand the difference? It‚Äôs really sad that Trump detractors cannot help themselves.This only feeds into the fake news narrative. The media would also be asking every Republican whether they condemn it. This particular one was not because the injury was caused deliberately. You left out the officer being criminally charged with battery for breaking his arms. Easy detail to miss, I know. It‚Äôs much faster is what it really comes down to. Agreed. They have a  modern look. Cayman is better looking. Not the better sports car. Kudos to you then, but I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre so defensive of the ‚Äúliving, breathing document‚Äù terminology. Do you support a constitutionalist judiciary that will interpret legislation in the manner it was originally intended?Judging by your defensive response, you do not. Let‚Äôs say what it really is. It‚Äôs specifically language used by leftists to justify the bypassing of the strenuous legislative process to alter the Constitution, and thereby legislating through the judiciary instead. Mueller has said there was insufficient evidence of coordination. Trump critics will beat the drum of Trump obstructing the investigation, but all his supporters have to point is:>‚Äùthe investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities"The above quote from the Mueller report is why impeachment is a bad move. There was way too much emphasis put on coordination by the Democrats for them to proceed with this now. Mueller has said there was insufficient evidence of coordination. Trump critics can beat the drum of there being tons of evidence of it, but all his supporters have to do is point to:>‚Äùthe investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities"The above quote from the Mueller report is why impeachment is a bad move. Nancy Pelosi is going to change the country‚Äôs mind? Clearing someone is not the job of a prosecutor, nor is that the legal standard we operate under. It‚Äôs honestly baffling seeing the left and media eat that line up. You‚Äôll learn about it in your freshman poli sci class. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Constitution Which political ideology is it again that uses the courts to make legislative-like changes to our Republic? They justify this shortcut by saying something along the lines of living, breathing document. This is packing the courts: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_Procedures_Reform_Bill_of_1937>The Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937[1] (frequently called the "court-packing plan")[2] was a legislative initiative proposed by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt to add more justices to the U.S. Supreme Court. Roosevelt's purpose was to obtain favorable rulings regarding New Deal legislation that the court had ruled unconstitutional.You all are employing deceptive language to try to blur the lines between the above and filling a vacancy. It‚Äôs nothing short of lazy propaganda. I‚Äôm always stumped with the ever-changing diction employed by the political left. How is filling a vacancy packing the courts? I‚Äôd be careful with the Washington Post, they are highly agenda-driven. I‚Äôm not surprised they omitted this from their story.  His Twitter bio says he is a columnist at Time, and his Wikipedia page elaborates that he is their foreign affairs columnist and editor-at-large. ‚ÄúTrump tweets a montage of Pelosi stumbling her words, but it only included instances of her stumbling her words.‚ÄùSomeone should explain to this person what a montage is. Webster‚Äôs definition of a montage:>the production of a rapid succession of images in a motion picture to illustrate an association of ideasDisregarding the absurdity of that statement, at least they were honest regarding the validity of Pelosi‚Äôs verbal stumbles. The majority of the left/media are either outright claiming those instances were doctored, or blurring the tweet with a separate, actual doctored video of Pelosi tweeted by a random person on the internet. What an ignorant comment. They‚Äôve come a long way since their first restaurant opened on college years ago. Well deserved too, because like you said their chicken is good.I also really like the artwork. They might be looking for a graphic designer, you should throw your name in the hat! Looks like it‚Äôs his wife. Still somewhat funny, but there‚Äôs really nothing to see here. >When the product being offered is necessary for you to live there is no incentive for those selling to do anything but raise prices.Unless there‚Äôs providers of said product offering it at a lower price in order to expand their market share.I honestly highly recommend reconsidering your stance towards the economic laws of supply and demand and how it relates to the implementation of subsidies and price controls.I understand you have your entrenched positions, but if we can‚Äôt establish a common ground with an agreement on basic facts there‚Äôs little reason to have a discussion. I recommend reading the article linked below. You‚Äôll get so much more out of your discussions with libertarians by doing so. https://www.investopedia.com/university/economics/economics3.asp There are more solutions outside of government subsidies and price controls. Whoever told you those are the only 2 solutions to people‚Äôs financial problems has limited your thinking. For one, there are economic laws that state subsidizes inevitably lead to a rise in prices, and price controls will inevitably lead to shortages. These are absolutes, as I said earlier. I understand the appeal to price controls and subsidies. It makes things simple to ignore economics and allocate power to the state because you want a quick fix, but you have to consider looking into these so-called solutions further. Once you apply just a little scrutiny, they fall apart. I like how I ask for a policy measure outside of subsidies and price controls, and you name subsidies and price controls. Who are the ones out of ideas again? What policy measures do you propose to mitigate financial problems of the average American that aren‚Äôt subsidies and price controls? I know it‚Äôs simple to think governmental force in those markets will solve those issues ‚Äî if we just had more decisions in the hands of the state then we could fix housing and education costs. The problem with that thinking is subsidizes inevitably lead to a rise in prices, compounding the issue further and price controls will inevitably lead to shortages. Those are absolutes. Capitalism also isn‚Äôt in ruins my friend. The US economy is thriving as a result of recent free market policy measures in regard to fiscal and regulatory policy. Socialism is ruins, as evidenced by the most recent failed state to embrace it. I love these memes on the sole basis they bring all the communists and socialists out. You guys are so mad. Check out the place on the corner of Garland and North. One bedroom apartment‚Äôs rent is $485. It‚Äôs just pointing out you are part of the brigade. It‚Äôs also absolutely hilarious the bot called you a commie based on your Reddit activity. More the reason why I sometimes consider the national media a more daunting political opposition than Democrats. They arguably carry more influence and hold no shame displaying their partisan double standards. Giving a Democrat defeat at the ballot box in my mind is synonymous with giving the national media defeat. u/userleansbot I just looked into those two by watching a few of their clips from back when the Mueller investigation ended. Expectingly, they were having a meltdown and just oozing TDS. Thanks for the laugh. Was impressed with Brooks though. It is interesting seeing a somewhat legitimate podcast show on the left with a resemblance to what Ben is doing. I imperiously assumed Pod Save America was pretty much it for you all. It‚Äôs a partisan brigade from those that have been foaming at the mouth and waiting in the wings to seize on a poor performance from Ben. Clearly, they fear him and his influence. You‚Äôve cleared missed my point because that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been saying. Partisan critics are seizing on this as a poor debate performance, but the journalist refused to let the interaction become a debate. He only wanted a one-sides grilling as he hurled derogatory statements such as ‚Äúyou support stone-age policies‚Äù and ‚Äúthe Republican Party can‚Äôt come up with ideas.‚Äù I live in the NWA area. Democrats here are generally progressives and social justice warriors. They have marches and protests quite a bit around town. Those people unequivocally oppose all of those positions you cited, minus separation of church and state. You honestly have a warped view of politics here. Your comment literally read as if it was determined by RNG. This guy‚Äôs an actual commie. Lmao. Are you a NPC? What‚Äôs nonsense is your inability to distinguish between a question and a statement guised as a question. If the BBC journalist asks Ben how he can support Stone Age pro-life policies, why can‚Äôt the Republican Party come up with ideas, he is making a statement that Ben‚Äôs held positions are objectively wrong. Him then hiding behind journalism when faced with questions about his own positions only makes him a coward. >Sorry that's outside your ken, but Shapiro is a feeble-minded shithead with nothing to say, and this interview made that glaringly clear to the entire planet, minus limp-dicked fanboys who share his alt right fake indignation and pettiness.You are oozing projection with this sort of petty drivel. Also, your assertion that Ben is alt-right immediately outs you as a very ignorant person just parroting the latest Vox article you read on Shapiro. You‚Äôre a troll. Don‚Äôt have anything better to do? >It really brought home how petulant Shapiro is, how tactless, how lacking in intellectual rigor or debate, his petty tactics of attacking his opposition personally rather than the arguments at handDid you even read your comment after typing it?It‚Äôs a compilation of empty snubs. Have some self-awareness. Partisan critics of Ben have been waiting to seize on a poor performance. We get that, but your claim of this being evidence that Ben is a poor debater is desperate. The BBC journalist attacked Ben‚Äôs pro life positions as being objectively wrong, but refused to answer for his own beliefs under the guise of being an objective journalist. He didn‚Äôt want an actual debate, he wanted a one-sided grilling. That‚Äôs not to say Ben couldn‚Äôt have handled answering for his past comments better. He knows he has a big target on his back, and should always be prepared to be hit with that. >If Ben lived in Arkansas,  his stated views would make him a Democrat.Which views are you referring to? When you‚Äôre attempting to paint someone as being objectively wrong on a particular subject, you should have to answer for your own beliefs. He hides behind the guise of being an objective journalist. The journalist intended to disparage Ben and asked loaded questions. ‚ÄúWhy do you support barbaric policies?‚Äù Anytime Ben asked a question of his own, we heard ‚Äúwhy sir, I‚Äôm just a journalist asking questions.‚Äù Not an even playing field, but that of course won‚Äôt stop partisan critics from pouncing on this as evidence Ben is a poor debater. The report was released weeks ago. You can literally go read it yourself. The findings were:>‚Äùthe investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities‚ÄùThat is a direct quote from the Mueller report. The Democrats are not happy with the conclusions, and are now trying push this manufactured cover up narrative to save face. 82 percent of people making between 50k and 75k got tax cuts totaling 1,000 according to the Tax Policy Center.Perhaps read into the studies of the TCJA before declaring the relevant facts aren‚Äôt even possible. 82 percent of people making between 50k and 75k got tax cuts totaling 1,000 according to the Tax Policy Center. It was much more than just a few dollars for the majority of Americans. You‚Äôre off the mark. This strictly pertains to the start of the investigation in mid 2016 and includes the actions taken throughout the election cycle. He won 304 electoral votes. He could have gone without Ohio‚Äôs 18. He didn‚Äôt even publicly address it until October of 2016. Remember when Obama told Romney his aggressive foreign policy stance against Russia was something from the 1980s? He had no intention of standing up against Russia until he was on his way out. >The report specifically doesn't exonerate Trump on the Russian issueNo where in the report does it say that. You‚Äôre thinking of volume 2, which deals with obstruction.The report rather specifically says this:>‚Äùthe investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities". Alright, you‚Äôre full of it guy. I‚Äôve read the most material parts to know that section 1 provided us with virtually no new information. Section 2 is by far the more damning. I did enjoy your response to me asking you to back up your claims, being you essentially making the claim again. Actually enjoyed this debate because of that. Great strategy. >The truth is while there is a mountain load of evidence for many elements of criminal conspiracy and coordination, there is missing evidence of a key piece of the crime (intent).This is clearly not true. Please dude, for the 4th time, briefly summarize what this is. You just repeating this claim over and over gets you no where. Back it up! So you‚Äôre saying the Mueller investigation did uncover a coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia. That is a bold claim. Can you just briefly summarize what it was? I understand the hesitation in accepting the truth and admitting wrong. You were spoon fed this narrative everyday of your life for years on end. >It's pretty clear you didn't read the report though since pages 55-174 lay out he evidence they did find. This is delusional. Quote me where in the report it claims evidence of this agreement is. But don‚Äôt you think if this really existed, media headlines and Congressional Democrats would be hammering it nonstop? The reason they aren‚Äôt is because it doesn‚Äôt say what you‚Äôve convinced yourself it says.  >We understood coordination to require an agreement ‚Äî tacit or express ‚Äî between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. **That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other‚Äôs actions or interests.** We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.‚ÄúCould not establish‚Äù means they could not find the evidence for it. Does that disappoint you? And yet it‚Äôs become a popular policy again among Democrats. Obvious troll, but it‚Äôs a false equivalency. It‚Äôs the role of the executive to enforce existing immigration laws. There‚Äôs also no constitutional amendment ensuring unlawful border crossings. No, she actually said during CNN‚Äôs town hall last night that current prisoners having a right to vote is a ‚Äúconversation that needs to be had.‚Äù Say it with me: **Mueller couldn‚Äôt establish coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.** >This investigation is looking into Conspiracy and Treason. Straight up. And Trump actively attempted to hinder that.Are you unaware to the fact the investigation has ended? It‚Äôs been over for a month.Mueller couldn‚Äôt establish any coordination between Trump‚Äôs campaign and Russia. I know being reminded of it triggers all the brigading statists here. He was a darling of the national media for quite a while, and also loved by the leftists over at r/politics. So we really don‚Äôt know how serious he could have been taken by the left as a candidate. Yet he was never scrutinized by the journalists that are supposed to hold government accountable. On the contrary, they laughed it up. >The report specifically said that don Jr conspiredCan you provide a quote of this? Seems like language such as that would be plastered across the airwaves. Where is the evidence of collusion in the report?This claim also contradicts with Mueller conclusion of:> ‚Äúthe investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.">Did they not make the judgment because they don't think they had the evidence, or **did they do it because they didn't feel it was their place to try?** Not in regard to collusion or coordination, but yes that‚Äôs arguable regarding their obstruction punt. I see this talking point a lot, but left-wing media in fact did begin using the term collusion before Trump ever did. Let‚Äôs not revise history here, no matter how tempting it might be. The media started using it throughout the 2016 election. Trump on the other hand didn‚Äôt start using it until after the election. Can you quote in the Mueller report where it says this? Are you willing to accept Mueller‚Äôs findings of there being no coordination between the campaign and Russia?Coordination is synonymous with collusion, but for the sake of this debate I‚Äôll use coordination. Collusion is synonymous with conspiracy or coordination. From Mueller:>‚Äùdid not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities,‚ÄùHow google defines collusion:>secret or illegal cooperation or conspiracy, especially in order to cheat or deceive others. What I quoted above isn‚Äôt Barr‚Äôs interpretation. That‚Äôs a direct quote from the Mueller report. >‚Äùdid not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities,‚ÄùHere‚Äôs how google defines collusion, since I know this is where you were going with this:>secret or illegal cooperation or conspiracy, especially in order to cheat or deceive others. If collusion had actually taken place, why did Mueller‚Äôs report conclude that it could not be established?Seems to me that for the most part, Democrats are focusing on Obstruction because it actually has teeth. Though they won‚Äôt move to impeach since collusion was the true end game, and the public isn‚Äôt ignorant to that. Democrats simply do not have the political capital to proceed with impeachment considering the results of this investigation. Now if someone like a Don Jr or Kushner had been indicted for conspiring with a foreign government, Democrats would absolutely have that political capital.Obviously that‚Äôs not the case and this ends up being a PR battle as you said. It will also stick around the next 2 years at minimum. Regarding Trump firing Comey, he had the constitutional authority to fire his FBI director. You could still argue it was obstruction of justice, but you would have to prove corrupt intent. I still think the Democrats should pursue this into 2020. Impeach him for obstruction, and see what happens. 2020 isn‚Äôt a guarantee for Democrats, so it might be a viable alternative for getting rid of Trump. Could he not indict Don Jr or Kushner for conspiring with a foreign government? He had that authority and those are the ones who presumably would have negotiated it directly. Are they not going to be hard pressed to remove him for something a 2 year Special Counsel investigation could not establish?I‚Äôm also dubious to congressional investigations having better resources than Mueller‚Äôs team for when they prove collusion. Could it be time to give up and wait until an election? Doesn‚Äôt it fall on Mueller? Him not indicting anyone for conspiring with a foreign government is the reason why Republicans won‚Äôt remove the President. It‚Äôs different with telling witnesses to lie, but regarding his request to fire Mueller or firing Comey, Trump has the Constitutional authority to do that. You would have to prove corrupt intent in that case. I‚Äôm in favor of Congress now pursuing impeachment for obstruction of justice. So many of the Democrats‚Äô constituents believe there‚Äôs an arguable case. Therefore they absolutely should listen to their constituents and impeach him. >The corrupt intent has to apply to the obstruction- not the underlying crimeI explained that very clearly in my comment. I‚Äôll reiterate:Obstruction requires corrupt intent. Since the Mueller report explicitly states an underlying crime of conspiracy with a foreign government could not be established, Trump‚Äôs motive with regard to obstruction was never corrupt in that he was trying to cover up a crime. Are you implying because Mueller is a Republican he didn‚Äôt want to indict for conspiracy with a foreign government? I know you just want anything to stick, but obstruction is an intent crime. This means to legitimately pursue Trump for Obstruction of Justice, there must be probable corrupt intent.But since the Mueller report explicitly states an underlying crime of conspiracy with a foreign government could not be established, Trump‚Äôs motive was never corrupt in that he was trying to cover up something. This is the biggest roadblock for obstruction. Perhaps there is another timeline where the Mueller investigation turned out differently, and established crimes committed by the President.We are not in that timeline. I hope you can one day come to grips with that fact. I know you just want anything to stick, but obstruction is an intent crime. This means to legitimately pursue Trump for Obstruction of Justice, there must be probable corrupt intent. But since the Mueller report explicitly states an underlying crime of conspiracy with a foreign government could not be established, Trump‚Äôs motive was never corrupt in that he was trying to cover up something. This is the biggest roadblock for his critics.Still, I encourage them to nonetheless pursue it. One thing about obstruction, there has to be corrupt intent. Since the Mueller report explicitly states an underlying crime of conspiracy with a foreign government could not be established, Trump‚Äôs motive was never corrupt in that he was trying to cover up something. This is why the lack of an underlying crime is so important and relevant to the obstruction allegation. I think this rule of law shtick is nothing but a charade. If the left was truly concerned about the rule of law, they wouldn‚Äôt be still pushing the collusion angle even after a two year Special Counsel investigation couldn‚Äôt undercover it. The Mueller probe is over. Is there a criminal charge of conspiring with a foreign government? No. If it existed, someone like Don Jr or Kushner would have gone down for it. If you really want to hope a congressional investigation is going to undercover collusion, after a two year special counsel with unlimited resources couldn‚Äôt, go for it. I encourage more like you to keep beating this dead horse. A flimsy obstruction allegation where the underlying crime is nonexistent? Under those circumstances, I actually want the Democrats to pursue impeachment. But sure, I‚Äôm smart enough to realize it won‚Äôt go anywhere. >that our leaders, regardless of party, are held to account when they break the law?Where in my comment did I give any indication of seeing this as non-important? I‚Äôm just not understanding why you asked this. From day one, absolutely. As someone who wants the Democrat party to perform poorly in elections, nothing would be sweeter than them pursuing impeachment for obstruction after collusion didn‚Äôt materialize from the special counsel investigation. They‚Äôre smarter than that, unfortunately. Look, collusion never materialized after years of a special counsel investigating it. Are you so rabidly partisan, you still think Trump is going down for this?Democrats aren‚Äôt as dumb as their hysterical base. They wouldn‚Äôt dare pursue obstruction when there was no collusion. I‚Äôm definitely not arguing Bill Clinton raped her. I oppose the ‚Äúguilty until proven innocent‚Äù mantra that is so popular these days. >Right, she paid the market value for it. That is by definition not a contribution and perfectly legal. Are you arguing that if Trump paid Russians for opposition research, it would be perfectly legal? The ‚Äúbabies in cages‚Äù thing, obviously. I had no expectation of you answering that honestly anyways. Just curious to see how you would go from such a strong condemnation to excusing it. > Yeah, that's the part that takes Trump voters from "not-respectable" to inhuman monsters for me.When it happened under the Obama Administration, did it make you conclude the  same thing about Obama supporters?(I ironically assume you yourself support Obama.) >Even if you assume that every single thing that every Clinton accuser ever said is true, the worst thing he ever did was expose himself to Paula Jones in a hotel room. (The affairs with Lewinsky and Flowers were, by their own admission, 100% consensual)He‚Äôs been hit with accusations of rape. One of which is well known, especially if you followed the 2016 election. >YES! 52 U.S. Code ¬ß 30121 makes it a crime for a foreign national to contribute any thing of value to a political campaign, or for an American to solicit it.We do know the Hillary Campaign paid for opposition research from a foreign national, so there‚Äôs that. >Not sure I follow. When someone puts forth a few axioms, such as "you forgot 9/11 because you elected omar", and then the next week say, "Muslims are taking over the country", and then the president showing video of terrorism along with her...All of these are clearly legal statements. >What if I were to say (and people listened to me, millions listened that is) that u/lookupmystats94 is a terrorist, hates America, and someone needs to do something, maybe 2a people could take care of it.This is arguably a call for someone to attack me. There may be some ambiguity, but it‚Äôs pretty direct when you say someone needs to do something to this terrorist. >Personally I reject that, I find both the president and my paragraph to be calls to action of violence. Maybe not criminal, but morally. Anyone who is against calls to violence should be against what the president is doing.The first one is not. Quoting Omar downplaying a terrorist attack that killed 3,000 people is not the same as calling for people to attack her. Stop equating speech to violence. Seems like so many people are craving for a legal line to be crossed, it disrupts their thinking for what constitutes criminality. Lawfare is the new political strategy for too many. >I mean, how obvious does it need to be? Does it need to be a direct call to action?On the contrary, at what point in your mind does criticism not warrant criminal proceedings from the state? You aren‚Äôt calling for violence unless you call for violence, if that makes sense. >In the case of Trump alluding to his rather-well-known-for-thinking-all-muslims-are-terrorists base that Ilhan Omar is a terrorist, is this a case of going too far, or someone just not fully considering their actions?That‚Äôs a partisan interpretation. All Trump did was quote her and show news coverage of 9/11. My interpretation is that she downplayed a horrific attack on the country. Even if he did outright say she is a terrorist, he isn‚Äôt calling for people to attack her. He would have to call for people to attack her to do that. There‚Äôs a New York Times headline right now that states Trump criticizing her description of 9/11 is indicative of him being anti-Islam. Some of these people are legitimately insane. If Trump described it as such, there would be so much blowback from the media and Democrats. It‚Äôd be warranted too. It‚Äôs frustrating. Words apparently don‚Äôt have meaning to them. That potential tax revenue belonged to the collective society, comrade./s Right. I just don‚Äôt see how someone as interested in politics as he seemingly is has such a misunderstanding of current events. I don‚Äôt see how anyone could read your comments and decide they‚Äôre worthy of a rational discussion. Dwayne Johnson won it back in 1998. Additionally he won it when it was the only heavyweight title. >I can also find you 20 videos of dogs getting pooped on by humans. Sounds like you can really deliver on this. Like you‚Äôve got 20 bookmarks ready to go.  >And yet- Mueller filed evidence about sharing campaign data with Russia. That evidence was sealed, and only came out because of a screw up. That evidence points directly at collusion. And that evidence would support the same kind of charge- conspiracy/ foreign agent, because he was literally acting as a foreign agent of Russia.Again, more misinformation. That piece of information didn‚Äôt pertain to the failure to register as a foreign agent charge, it pertained to his charge of lying to federal prosecutors. >Mr. Manafort‚Äôs lawyers made the disclosure by accident, through a formatting error in a document filed to respond to charges that he had lied to prosecutors working for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, after agreeing to cooperate with their investigation into Russian interference in the election.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/us/politics/manafort-trump-campaign-data-kilimnik.htmlI have enjoyed this exchange. I definitely would recommend better news sources though. Good luck to you on taking down Trump.  Does your comment really strike you as a meaningful contribution to this discussion?  No, it‚Äôs widely known the charge of failing to register as a foreign agent pertains strictly to his lobbying work with the Ukraine ten years ago:>In a criminal trial scheduled to begin Monday, federal prosecutors planned to argue that for nine years starting in 2005, Mr. Manafort ran a lobbying campaign in Washington on behalf of pro-Russia political forces in Ukraine without disclosing his activities to the Justice Department as required. When confronted, the indictment alleges, he lied to department officials.https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/13/us/politics/paul-manafort-fara-foreign-lobbying-law.htmlYou‚Äôre connecting dots that aren‚Äôt there, and using misinformation to do so. I‚Äôm just curious, what is your main source of information? As a Dem, do you accept Mueller‚Äôs findings with regard to collusion? Failing to register as a foreign agent for his work with the Ukraine in 2012 is different from criminally conspiring with a foreign actor during the 2016 campaign, don‚Äôt you think? Can you link me to just one? No mainstream media source has covered Manafort pleading guilty to conspiring with a foreign actor. You clearly have information that no else does. This would also contradict Barr‚Äôs summary of Mueller‚Äôs findings, meaning impeachment goes into full swing.  The left wing base needed that information debunked immediately, or it would reach point where they would never disbelieve it and subsequently push conspiracy theories over the matter. Mueller didn‚Äôt want that to materialize, so he refuted it immediately.  >He pled guilty to that charge. The charge was not sealed.Manafort pled guilty to the charge of criminally conspiring with a foreign actor, got it.Except there are no news articles on it and no public information relative to it. Honestly, why haven‚Äôt you gone to the media with this bombshell?  Not even a scratch on the surface, but it such a material piece of misinformation that Mueller felt an obligation to refute it.  Where‚Äôs Manafort‚Äôs charge for criminal conspiracy with a foreign agent? You implied it existed, but was sealed. Or are you backing away now that the facts say otherwise? >It wasn‚Äôt covered in the trial, however, it was a guilty plea, to a charge Mueller raised as a requirement for lenience based on cooperation. What exactly the details were- were sealed.No, we know exactly what the charge was. You simply have bad information:>In short, says Mateja, this means that Manafort and Gates simply agreed to take illegal action. In this case, the illegal action Manafort and Gates are alleged to have taken, according to the indictment, includes failing to report their foreign bank account reports, failing to register as foreign agents and providing false statements about their lobbying work with Ukrainian government over the course of 11 years.http://time.com/5002415/paul-manafort-was-just-indicted-for-conspiracy-against-the-united-states-whats-that/>Is trump not colluding...  but surrounded by people who were/ are? People he appointed?This information was released last Sunday concerning the findings of the 2 year Special Counsel investigation:>The Special Counsel‚Äôs investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities." People are also forgetting that Mueller explicitly refuted a Buzzfeed story that was misinformation about his investigation. I personally believe that no matter what the facts are, the left will still believe there was a conspiracy.  >They both were? And manafort convicted of conspiracy against the US... Was that Conspiracy against the US charge actually just tax evasion, or conspiring with foreign actors as you are implying? The latter would be huge, but I think more people besides you would know about it if true.  Doing God‚Äôs work!  What you left out of your comment was that statement strictly pertaining to Obstruction. The findings of the investigation that pertained to collusion were this: >The Special Counsel investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. >He didn‚Äôt. He simply said there isn‚Äôt enough evidence to indict. There is almost certainly some evidence or else this investigation wouldn‚Äôt have taken this long.You‚Äôre being disingenuous. That phrasing pertained strictly to Obstruction. We know that even though Trump acted in inappropriately at times, the Special Counsel‚Äôs investigation into Russian collusion was allowed to conclude. The findings of the investigation that pertained to collusion were this: >The Special Counsel investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.Is it a hard pill to swallow? Sure, but you need to starting being honest about it.  Leftists still alleging the duly elected President conspired with Russia after a 2 year Special Counsel investigation could not establish it, is indeed a partisan circle jerk.  Good point. When do you think the walls will finally close in for Trump and Russian collusion? Surely with how clear it is that shady stuff went down, Mueller had exposure to it with the vast resources of the Special Counsel investigation. Yet he still decided collusion was never established. Don‚Äôt you think that perhaps Mueller has been compromised by the Russians? Which he walked back. Doesn‚Äôt excuse that instance, but to say he has never conceded the interference is false. I just hope some of you can have closure and move on from the obsession with the 2016 election. Russia‚Äôs main goal was always to sow division, and the left made sure they overdelivered on that.  It‚Äôs not worthy of acknowledgement because it‚Äôs not factual. You can find public statements of Trump conceding Russian interference dating back to January of 2017:>President-elect Donald J. Trump on Wednesday conceded for the first time that Russia had carried out cyberattacks against the two major political parties during the presidential election, but he angrily rejected unsubstantiated reports that Moscow had gathered compromising personal and financial information about him that could be used for extortion.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/us/politics/trumps-press-conference-highlights-russia.htmlSome of you are just so knee deep in misinformation that it‚Äôs difficult to entrainment it.  To pretend the intention of the Special Counsel was to confirm Russian interference is nothing short of idiocy. The goal post of the investigation was criminal conspiracy of colluding with a foreign government. That‚Äôs what was investigated by Mueller with all the resources of the Special Counsel. Trying to claim anything but that now that the findings are out is extremely insincere.  >The Special Counsel‚Äôs investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.I know it‚Äôs a tough pill to swallow. It‚Äôs honestly unfair how so many of you were led on for years.  Do you honestly believe Trump was refuted by Mueller‚Äôs findings?  Interesting example of how we interpret things differently based on the person speaking. You‚Äôre clearly wrong, perhaps remove Sarah Sanders from the statement and you‚Äôll understand.  It really is. 10/10 glorious day.  Badass, right? Clearly a partisan like me viewing this as advantageous should tell you everything you need to know as far as the pettiness of subsequent investigations. Keep it up.  Mueller wasn‚Äôt the accuser, he was the special prosecutor investigating the accusation. The accusations stem from the GOP‚Äôs political opposition in the Democrats and national media. How we basically know it was false at this point is because no one was charged with criminally conspiring with a foreign government. The 2 year investigation is now ended, with no subsequent indictments.  This is one of the biggest political stories of my life. The political ramifications of this will extend into the 2020 election as well. Overall, this seems to have gone well for the GOP.  Credit to /u/olliegarkey! Im with it, I‚Äôm legit subscribed to the_SDNY. Let‚Äôs get the new movement growing! You‚Äôre either a liar or just haven‚Äôt followed this story until like last week. >‚ÄùHis eagerness to sell out America proves that Russians must have something personally, politically or financially on President Trump," Pelosi said Tuesday at a press conference.https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/democrats-say-putin-has-kompromat-on-trump-gop-says-no-wayMore examples:https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/03/mark-warner-trump-russia-collusion-1200571https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/03/schiff-direct-evidence-trump-collusion-russia.amphttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pelosi-schumer-trumps-news-conference-suggests-putin-has-something-on-him/2018/07/16/a83a7fba-891a-11e8-8aea-86e88ae760d8_story.html?utm_term=.a79dbe5f7a44https://dailycaller.com/2019/02/14/bob-menendez-trump-russia/Polling data on Democratic voters:>Every time respondents were asked about the investigation, about 8 in 10 Democrats said they thought the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, while 7 in 10 Republicans said they did not.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-poll/on-trumps-ties-to-russia-americans-have-made-up-their-minds-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKCN1QP1E5 There‚Äôs some credence in that, you personally may have taken a more reserved position. It‚Äôs just when I see people like you claim the Democrats also took reserved positions and didn‚Äôt outright accuse Trump of collusion for years that I legitimately laugh out loud. Have some shame man.  Defense against taking accountability for accusing the duly elected President of being a Russian agent for the past 3 years, remember?Reread your previous comment. It‚Äôs a good example of it. Well, one of the active members here just created The_SDNY. You can‚Äôt make this shit up.You should go subscribe right now.  I know, this well funded, well resourced, multiple year spanning special counsel investigation was always second tiered to the Southern District of New York. Are you all going to start a new sub now, the_SDNY? >I do think that most Dems, regardless of what they think or hope for, have been good about not making finite statements about Trump colluding with Russia. Especially party leadership - Pelosi, Schumer, Obama, etc. - have been pretty quiet about the whole thing.This is gold, and is exactly what I expect more and more going forward.‚ÄúWe never accused Trump of collusion, we just wanted to make sure there was none. We always presumed Trump was innocent.‚ÄùGive us a freaking break. Conservative media outlets are going to compile ample amounts of finite accusations from top Dems and top national media outlets over the years alleging Trump was a Russian agent. This line of defense is not going to work. I applaud the attempt, though.  Indictments are done, meaning the Russian investigation resulted in no charges of criminal conspiring with a foreign government. The investigation was well funded, well resourced, and lasted 2 years.This mean allegations of collusion were unfounded, and that so many of you were falsely led on by your media and politicians. My expectation is that many on the left will not respond in good faith. Many will now claim they never alleged collusion or even heard of the word. I‚Äôve seen one news article already claim Trump in fact started using the word collusion first. Some will take accountability, and admit they were overzealous with these allegations.Media narrative will likely lay the blame at Trump for making them suspicious, and take the position that there‚Äôs no need to apologize for alleging for years the duly elected President was a foreign agent.  This sub is a little awkward all of a sudden. RIP. Really reminds me of that meltdown sub-reddit made by the left to compile Trump supporters‚Äô ensuing meltdowns after Trump‚Äôs expected loss in 2016. After Election Day, the sub was essentially taken over by gloating Trump supporters for a while.  Why weren‚Äôt there any charges of it then? This investigation was well funded, well resourced, and lasted for 2 years.No more excuses. You people have to eventually admit this conspiracy never took place as you all were led on to believe by the national media and Democrats.  >You‚Äôre last part is the best, that collusion isn‚Äôt a crime.  You‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs the colloquial name for it.  It‚Äôs like saying ‚Äústabbing someone isn‚Äôt a crime!‚Äù, you‚Äôd be technically correct that there‚Äôs no stabbing statute, it‚Äôs assault with a deadly weapon.Can you even read? My comment never said that. What‚Äôs missing from the Russia investigation are charges of criminal conspiracy to collude with a foreign government.Your initial comment alleged someone was incorrect for saying there were no charges of criminal conspiring with a foreign government. He was clearly correct, and you were not informed enough on the investigation. Don‚Äôt even pretend that charges of criminal conspiring with a foreign government wasn‚Äôt the end goal here, either. That‚Äôs always been the end goal, not charges of lying to the FBI.  Be smarter than that. He told Russia to hack Hillary‚Äôs private email server. That email server only existed when she was SOS, 4 years at minimum prior to that 2016 comment. Logic would consequently tell you that he was not serious, and that painting his comment as anything otherwise is either deceptive or simply idiotic.  Your biggest logical flaw is believing that money earned by the individual belongs to the collective society rather than that individual. When the state decreases my personal tax burden, I am not being given more money. I am keeping more of the money I have earned. Understanding this distinction and knowing why it‚Äôs significant is a good first step in understanding free-market economics.  On the flip side, there‚Äôs nothing that the report might say to exonerate him in the eyes of partisan Democrats, the national media, and their base. Someone like you will still be convinced there was Russian collusion, even if Mueller‚Äôs report concludes there was not.  There‚Äôs some credence in that, but it also demonstrates the outright savagery of our national media and Democratic Party to push allegations of treason against a democratically elected President for years, only for those allegations to be unfounded.  No, you‚Äôre misinformed. Flynn was charged for lying to the FBI, not Congress. There were also never any subsequent charges for colluding with Russia, despite the implication of your comment.There have been zero charges for collusion. Anyone telling you otherwise is either uninformed like you initially were, or purposely misleading you. Yep, February‚Äôs jobs report shows the highest wage growth in a decade. I‚Äôd bet my bottom dollar the user above hasn‚Äôt even thought to read those reports.  Right. I‚Äôm not arguing the guy wasn‚Äôt a scumbag or that it couldn‚Äôt have escalated to a situation where deadly force was warranted. It just seems like the officer was not in the vehicle‚Äôs path until he decided to get a clear shot of the suspect.  >they‚Äôre still not mainstream despite ratings, viewership and influence.Which still pales in comparison to the mainstream press. It‚Äôs more instructive to compare the 5 p.m. viewership of Fox to the collective of NBC, ABC, CBS, CNN, and MSNBC. Fox‚Äôs alternative viewpoint reaches a fraction of the people that the mainstream press‚Äôs does.  Yep, hands down the most balanced debate of the 2016 general election.  Then the IRS released data showing refunds were up from last year, and the media never spoke of it again.  They contrast with the apparatus of the national news media, 90 percent of which is left-leaning. They‚Äôre more of an alternative than mainstream.  Not paying taxes doesn‚Äôt make you a traitor to your country. Unless you‚Äôre intentionally being misleading and attempting to lump his tax crimes into the Trump-Russia allegations.  The quote isn‚Äôt as fallacious as you make it out to. Here‚Äôs the exact quote and underlying context:‚ÄúThere's a lot of people more concerned about being precisely, factually, and semantically correct than about being morally right.‚Äù >But that $21 trillion estimate isn‚Äôt necessarily waste; it‚Äôs just sloppily accounted for, according to that study. It‚Äôs also not just money the Pentagon spends; it includes money coming into the Pentagon. And that $32 trillion price tag is an estimate for the first 10 years of Medicare-for-all, while the Pentagon number accounts for a 17-year period. Ocasio-Cortez‚Äôs numbers weren‚Äôt just wrong on the margins; her conclusion made no logical sense in light of the actual facts. What‚Äôs more, this isn‚Äôt the only claim she‚Äôs made that has been debunked; The Post‚Äôs team documented five false claims she made during an August media blitz following her primary upset of Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.).https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/01/07/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-very-bad-defense-her-falsehoods/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.ad3e9a1ead4e Car was idling forward at maybe 3 mph. The officer shouldn‚Äôt have resorted to deadly force in that moment. I still doubt this reaches criminal charges but a civil lawsuit is a guarantee.  Obvious trolling.  This is how the left is going to rationalize the years worth of hysteria once Mueller‚Äôs report comes out and doesn‚Äôt say what they want it to. I‚Äôve heard the same talking point thrown on CNN lately. People like me have seen this coming a thousand miles away.  I have a job that I chose voluntarily and live in a house I bought voluntarily.Hearing a statist complain about having to work for a living is always amusing, though.  Journalists are trained in word choice and framing; and the ones that can utilize these tricks well enough are the ones writing for propaganda rags such as the New York Times. Just don‚Äôt let them ever deter you from ‚Äúpouncing.‚Äù ‚ÄúPounce‚Äù every time the opportunity presents itself.  Since when does leftism not advocate the nationalization of industries, top-down economic planning, or redistributionist policy measures?  Imagine being obsessed with making voluntary decisions throughout your life. How vile.  Other way being a below the line deduction, meaning you could only utilize it if you opt against the standard deduction and itemize.  I‚Äôve been explaining that a proposal isn‚Äôt law. The student loan interest deduction is and has always been available since it first became law. You seem to want to argue, out of boredom. Find a better hobby.  Ok, the student loan interest deduction has been tax law since 1997. We‚Äôre obviously not communicating on the same page, so I‚Äôll end this on that note.  Do you not believe this post is misleading? Think about how many people read this, and now believe the student loan interest deduction is removed. That proposal never became law, so the deduction was always in place. People incorrectly stating the student loan interest deduction is removed are misinformed. Simple as that.  It was never ‚Äúnot there‚Äù though.  Either way, the student loan interest deduction is still available. It went unchanged, as opposed to what this post propagates you to think.  Yup, you can still deduct student loan interest as an above the line deduction. Nothing changed with regard to that, but you still see this misconception repeated often.  They most certainly are not. Yeah, this is one of the most Orwellian talking-points I see these days. A CNN article I read a few days ago just casually claimed that tax cuts were a form of big government spending. It‚Äôs just mind numbing sometimes.  So what happens when most of the people don‚Äôt want to give away their shit? Is the commune going to just accept it? Yup. He‚Äôs banned.  Pointing out political bias in media does not equate opposition to free speech. You‚Äôre letting your emotion spill over into your arguments. She defeated a white incumbent in a minority-majority district. Her win was not an impressive one, especially when you consider how much of her rhetoric consists of intersectional politics.  I specifically said without an underlying crime. Emphasis on ‚Äúunderlying.‚Äù That‚Äôs an optimistic outlook, but I think you‚Äôre giving the ideological left way too much credit.  Unskilled, non-English speaking illegal immigrant families are not going to be voting for the party that advocates individualism and free market policy measures. Especially as we progress more into an automated economy.  The whole ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt get it then I won‚Äôt explain it‚Äù excuse is becoming a prominent meme on liberals. Hopefully it will eventually dissuade them from using that response.  The deputy DNC chair has publicly advocated for open borders. This is easily accessible information.  I believe the charges consist of obstruction and false statements, all without an underlying crime. Same as usual.  You‚Äôre good, I was referring to the user that you initially replied to.  Yup. Here‚Äôs even some polling regarding the matter:>The NBPC‚Äôs survey, of more than 600 agents in two of the Border Patrol‚Äôs busiest sectors, found just the opposite: A stunning 89 percent of line agents say a ‚Äúwall system in strategic locations is necessary to securing the border.‚Äù Just 7 percent disagreed.>https://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/apr/2/border-patrol-agents-back-trump-wall-survey-finds/For someone to have the gall to come here claiming no border agent wants a wall, while all evidence says the contrary is really bemusing. I can guarantee it‚Äôs their last comment. Leftist organizations got the machine in gear, people just didn‚Äôt buy into it. You can read more into it on Wikipedia. The left had a failed attempt at taking down Chick fil A many years ago. Their efforts actually spurred a very successful counter-boycott.  https://twitter.com/Harlan/status/1087764544364126208?s=20Here‚Äôs a video of a CNN host claiming the Black Israelites were just 4 young black men preaching about the Bible and oppression. It then cuts to the group of Black Israelites condemning gay people and the MAGA kids booing them.  But then you‚Äôd have talk of hate speech and a much more coordinated backlash. The legality would be brought into question and that‚Äôs an important distinction as far as a libertarian perspective goes.  Buck Sexton and Ben Shapiro are among the best. They‚Äôre highly informed, articulate, and leftists are generally afraid to debate them.You can‚Äôt go wrong listening to either of them.  It was really just one that did so during the Civil Rights era. From what you hear in academia and media you‚Äôd think dozens switched.  The deputy chair of the DNC has openly advocated for open borders. This is easily accessible information.  Lots of Chapo trolls. More arguably.  All were born while she was at a minimum engaged. Don‚Äôt come into our sub clutching your pearls, you dirty liberal.  No, because it‚Äôs a binary choice with regard to how illegal immigration happens.You either cross the border unlawfully or do so legally then overstay the visa. What other method do you think there is? Of course these are economic opportunists. We all know they don‚Äôt meet the actual standards of asylum. That actually could change once the next Democrat President takes over. There‚Äôs a particular course of asylum that is controlled by the executive, and they can tweak the qualifications.  Because of the social services offered to them by our government. It‚Äôs really just common sense for them to bypass Mexico.  >They did support it in the past, when there were still parts that had high crossing rates. These easy to cross border sections have been fenced off now with something like 90% effectiveness. Where are you getting this information? I follow this topic strongly and hear what experts that patrol the border everyday have to say about it.Democrats supported massive funding of border security in 2013. What measures of border security have passed since then that resulted in 90% effectiveness? There aren‚Äôt any. He is talking from his ass.  The argument being made is that most are overstays. Most illegal immigrants have arrived through unlawful border crossings according to every estimate out there.  Your own source says that 55 percent of illegal immigrants arrived through unlawful border crossings, yet you claim most have arrived through visa overstays. Liberals come to this sub by the week and make this misrepresentation while citing data that debunks it. It‚Äôs bizarre and of course always their last post here.  Advocating for immigration and the advocation of unlawful immigration are two very different things.  Is this a joke? We would curb the millions of tax revenue spent on social services for illegal immigrant families each year. Unskilled labor is also becoming more and more obsolete as we progress into an automated economy.  Your own source estimates that most illegal immigrants arrived through unlawful border crossings. Why are you continuously making misrepresentations about this throughout this post? Estimates say the majority of illegal immigrants arrived through unlawful border crossings. Don‚Äôt spread misinformation in this sub.  Right, which they arguably should do because it‚Äôs merely a matter of time until Democrats do it. Especially considering the cover they‚Äôll receive from the national media after doing so. Republicans won‚Äôt do it though for the sake of public relations as well as the permanent damage it‚Äôd do to the legislative process. I can‚Äôt fault them for either choice.  It‚Äôs 60 votes because the number of votes to end debate for legislation is 60. Until that rule is changed to a mere simple majority, spending bills will require 60 votes pass in the Senate.  Yes, Congress can‚Äôt just utilize reconciliation whenever. It doesn‚Äôt apply to short term spending bills, and there are various rules that make it difficult to utilize successfully. The spending bill that passed in the House last week couldn‚Äôt have passed with reconciliation in the Senate. If it were that simple, the GOP would have rammed through the bill.  >Never. It‚Äôs just a straw man argument. No one supports open borders, and no one will in our lifetime as a legitimate candidate.This is misinformation. Top officials within the Democratic Party support open borders. For example, the DNC deputy chair has publicly advocated for open borders. >We control all 3 branches of government, and we can‚Äôt even keep the government open.You‚Äôre demonstrating an inadequate understanding of how our federal government works. For spending bills to pass in the upper chamber of Congress, they must obtain a filibuster-proof 60 votes rather than a simple majority. If Republicans had a 60 seat majority, or legislation required a 51 vote threshold to pass, you‚Äôd have a point. Obviously, none of that is the case.  No you didn‚Äôt.  No shit. This is common sense. Research is cool but pretty damn unnecessary.  >And here's one that talks about how 65% of illegal immigrants are from overstaying Visas (Which is something a wall can not prevent)https://www.factcheck.org/2018/06/illegal-immigration-statistics/Clever, making a misleading claim and just linking a source as to create the illusion it‚Äôs a fact. Your link in fact does not say 65% of illegal immigrants in the United States are from visa overstays. It cites a recent estimate that puts it at 44%. That‚Äôs a material misrepresentation, so I felt clarification was necessary:>A Center for Migration Studies report estimates that 44 percent of those in living in the U.S. illegally in 2015 were visa overstays. That‚Äôs up from an estimated 41 percent in 2008. It‚Äôs not a clever comment, and the context isn‚Äôt as applicable to just any post as you seem to think it is. This post is about John Bolton being a warmonger. Your pasted comment isn‚Äôt really relevant to it. It‚Äôs just bizarre.  You‚Äôve copied and pasted this exact comment in multiple threads. Stop spamming it as if people aren‚Äôt noticing.  Weinstein is accused of rape by multiple women, and has been criminally charged. O‚ÄôReilly is accused of sexual harassment, and settled in civil court. This is a false equivalence. The fact that this study shows liberals equally view jail time as justified for both men paints them as biased against their out group. Conservatives are in the right for not equally viewing jail time justified for both men. **Edit:** I just realized study doesn‚Äôt actually mention Weinstein‚Äôs criminal charges of rape. It claims he‚Äôs only been accused of harassment. This study refutes itself.  18th century liberalism is actually much more aligned with modern day libertarianism than modern day liberalism. It‚Äôs certainly no coincidence.  First of all, I‚Äôm not a nigga. Get your terminology right because talking like you‚Äôre a little gangbanger makes you come off as a moron. Don‚Äôt defeat yourself like that, even though your argument doesn‚Äôt do you any better. You also haven‚Äôt dismantled anything. All your argument consists of is repeating the same incorrect definition of a compromise.You wanting something major from me, but proposing only taking half is not a compromise. No, I don‚Äôt want you to take half, therefore I‚Äôm not going to be accepting that. A compromise is inherently something both sides agree to. Democrats don‚Äôt have a monopoly on the federal government. They have to compromise with the other side, as in give them something of legislative value. It‚Äôs a trade-off. You want to go through my post history like a little creeper and mock my Porsche, as if are driving around something better. Maybe you are, but I would bet money at 24 years old you didn‚Äôt own a house and two vehicles. All while paying off student loans. Even then you little internet hood rat, I likely make more money at 24 than you do at 30 or however old your ass is.  Let‚Äôs say you had 10 dollars, and wanted to buy lunch. I had an extra sandwich, and wanted some cash. I take half of your money, so that I have cash and you still have 5 dollars to possibly buy some lunch. That‚Äôs a compromise, according to you. If you were business minded, and somehow in a business meeting explaining your version of a compromise, you would rightfully be laughed out of the room. Good riddance, you little statist.  Yeah, I‚Äôm done explaining middle school concepts to you like as if you were a fucking child. You‚Äôre a retard.  Awesome, was definitely the right call.  The gold is honestly pretty ugly. Go with silver. A compromise involves two parties with each giving a concession of which the other sees as valuable. Statists not getting everything they want with regard to gun control is not the same as giving up a concession. A concession would be something such as national CCL, which gun rights advocates want. All this tells me is that you‚Äôre intellectually inadequate to even be having this debate. I can say with full confidence that you‚Äôre an idiot.  >Its a compromise between the two sides, which is ultimately what we should be striving for.That isn‚Äôt a what a compromise is. A compromise would be each side giving up concessions to the other. Gun rights advocates only losing some of their rights isn‚Äôt an actual concession from the left. The left has to concede something gun rights advocates want. Understand now? You can get charges from your criminal record expunged after a year or two. Most people determined to have successful careers do just that after slip ups with the law.  >They do not pay their taxes from their own pockets in case you didn't know companies (and yes at times their own companies) help pay their taxes with the money they make from selling goods to the "bottom 90%".... The phrase ‚Äútop 1 percent‚Äù of earners is strictly pertinent to individual tax filers. Everyone that works for a company receives that company‚Äôs revenue in compensation. How do you not know this?I‚Äôm actually 24 years old, with my own house and my first Porsche. I‚Äôve worked my ass off for the career I have and I‚Äôm sure you can‚Äôt say the same you little statist. Only reason I say you seem young is because you come off as a 16 year old kid that‚Äôs never held a job over 6 months. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong, but that‚Äôs just my impression with the rhetoric you use.  >In 2014, the top 1 percent of taxpayers accounted for more income taxes paid than the bottom 90 percent combined. The top 1 percent of taxpayers paid $543 billion, or 39.48 percent of all income taxes, while the bottom 90 percent paid $400 billion, or 29.12 percent of all income taxeshttps://taxfoundation.org/summary-latest-federal-income-tax-data-2016-update/I know you‚Äôre probably young, and your kind definitely worries me for our future. We need less partisan idiots.  Just to reiterate, the debate at hand is that where you work is in fact voluntary. Someone above claimed you don‚Äôt get to choose where you work, then you chimed in defending that position. So, try to grasp what voluntary means. It can be summed up as doing something without being forced to. Just because there are limitations with regard to where people can be hired and the positions they are qualified for, doesn‚Äôt mean they have no options other than their current situation. I understand the defeatist mentality you‚Äôre depicting. It‚Äôs the mindset of people who aren‚Äôt willing to make changes in life and stay complacent with their minimum wage paycheck. That‚Äôs entirely different from involuntarily working a particular job.  >Which is funny, because many of such places are currently plagued by anarcho-capitalism, like the USA. The U.S. is not one of these places where it‚Äôs difficult to voluntarily switch jobs. If you think it is in comparison to a country such as Rwanda, you are warped.If you want to speak to the facts, countries ranked highest on the economic freedom index are the richest and most prosperous countries in the world. Unsurprisingly, countries ranked low with regard to economic freedom are among the poorest:https://imgur.com/gallery/kOtyyf2Source: https://www.cato.org/blog/new-economic-freedom-index-us-returns-top-10-0 >Most of our money also goes to them as we pay more in taxes than those in the "1%" Do you have a source for this? Only because I would love to know where I can read more of this sort of nonsense.  Ironically, many of the places in the world where it‚Äôs more difficult to switch career paths or jobs are countries that are/were plagued by Marxism at one point in time.  >But on the flip side, I don't think it's an unreasonable stance to say that a civilized society should rise above nature and our primitive states. There‚Äôs nothing primitive about being a productive society. Productivity is synonymous with happiness and satisfaction. Someone engaged in a sedentary lifestyle will not be living an overall happy life. >Especially since the next logical leap from that is "okay, if the rich are going to hoard wealth, I am going to go murder them and take it from them because it's just nature bro." This of course already takes place. There‚Äôs always been home invaders and robbers. What I take issue with here is your characterization of these actions as logical.  The ones indulged in this sort of behavior are not logical thinkers. The logical course of action rather would be joining the ranks of productive members of society and providing for oneself through your own merit.  I am capable of realizing you‚Äôre not worth a valid discussion.  With regard to? >a bunch of social tatists?A bunch of what? Control. Statists by design seek control of others, so naturally they brigade right-leaning communities to steer discussions in their favor.  >I‚Äôm not sure how the requirement of ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù got dragged into this. Then you failed to understand the premise of this thread. Sowell‚Äôs quote references the alarming rate that a particular ideology writes off any of its criticisms as deviousness. A perfect example I found yesterday, from a mainstream voice among the left: https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nate-silver-blasted-for-claiming-ocasio-cortez-criticism-rooted-in-sexism-racismThis is the gut reaction among the mainstream left when faced with what is usually legitimate criticism. They get urged to simply scream allegations of sexism, racism, bigotry, homophobia, xenophobia, etc.There isn‚Äôt an equivalent aggregate of buzzwords used at a similar scale among the mainstream right. Most of your examples are terms used on r/thedonald. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm inclined to believe you don‚Äôt have a realistic perception of mainstream conservative figures.  Leftist and snowflake are arguable, but the rest of those are not things you hear mainstream conservatives call their partisan opposition. Do any of you ever listen to mainstream conservatives? They‚Äôre nothing how you‚Äôve been conditioned to perceive them.  Is there an equivalent aggregate of zingers that mainstream conservatives use? You honestly come off as the sort of statist that cheers for an economic crash, just so you can finally be right.  And here come the statists.. What‚Äôs he ever said that‚Äôs racist? I‚Äôm disappointed none of them accused him of being a racist.  That‚Äôs a bad look, but even if this November 2015 contact did arrange a meeting between Trump and Putin it would only amount to more circumstantial evidence of collusion. Hard evidence is going to be difficult to find.Honestly, most of the smarter critics of Trump are putting more hope in the 2016 NDA and alleged election fraud surrounding it having more of a chance to implicate Trump than the collusion theory.  You honestly come off as very unintelligent after engaging with you. Low-effort trolling is what this reminds me of, which speaks poorly of you if this is how you genuinely discourse.  Cohen‚Äôs sentencing pertains to the NDA made prior to the election. As far as I‚Äôm aware, it has nothing to do with Trump-Russia collusion. If there‚Äôs evidence of Trump colluding with Russia in there, cite it. Why don‚Äôt you try being civil, and engage their curiosity with this wealth of information you know of with regard to Trump committing treason? You‚Äôre not contributing anything of value to this sub with your smart ass, passive aggressive comments. >like the tax bill or general deregulation.Ironically, these are at times very unpopular here in r/libertarian. An active mod team is much needed here.  No, there‚Äôs not a lot of evidence. There‚Äôs the circumstantial evidence of Don Jr. meeting with the Russian lobbyist, but that‚Äôs the extent of it so far. The so called ‚Äúevidence of treason‚Äù consisting of when Trump publicly called for the Russians to hack Hillary‚Äôs private server only appeals to lowbrow liberals. Don‚Äôt be one of them.  Economists widely agree that price controls lead to shortages. They are not a good mechanism, because they buck the basic laws of supply and demand. A model example of this was the effect of Venezuela‚Äôs most extreme price controls introduced in 2014, the Fair Prices Act:>Venezuela on Friday decreed a new price control law that sets limits on company profits and establishes prison terms for those charged with hoarding or over-charging, part of socialist President Nicolas Maduro‚Äôs efforts to tame inflation.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-economy/venezuela-decrees-new-price-controls-to-fight-inflation-idUSBREA0N1GL20140124It was only shortly after this Venezuela began to cease releasing data on poverty, and their famine began materializing.  The real collapse stemmed from the governmental response to its hyper-inflation. Venezuela responded to its inflation by implementing widespread price controls. Price controls inevitably lead to shortages, which is precisely what happened in Venezuela.The resulting famine has actually been so bad, the average Venezuelan lost 24 pounds in 2017 according to [this](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-food/venezuelans-report-big-weight-losses-in-2017-as-hunger-hits-idUSKCN1G52HA) study. You‚Äôre a rabid leftist, yet you think you speak for actual conservatives?You‚Äôre done.  Same as the reason news media has a leftist bias being that conservatives self-select to not go into journalism. Some leftists will still even refer to the news media bias as a conspiracy, but the smarter ones have conceded on that front in light of relevant studies and evidence.  Some places are much more expensive than others. Are you in a high COL area? Good financial advice I received was putting back 10 percent of every paycheck. Even if you can manage half of that, you‚Äôre much better off.  That‚Äôs rough, I would not be complacent with that at all. Hope you can make some moves and have things work out.  What‚Äôs your degree in? No, illegal immigrants file tax returns. It‚Äôs estimated that about half of our illegal immigrant population does so.This report is pertinent to welfare consumption by illegal immigrants. It says as much in the article:> Non-citizens in the data include illegal immigrants, long-term temporary visitors like guest workers, and permanent residents who have not naturalized. I‚Äôm just saying your comment is misleading by stating there were multiple Democrats that switched over to the GOP when LBJ took over the party. There was only one. The rest stayed Democrats.  Could you direct me to which era the Democrats favored lowered business taxes? Would it be post-FDR? This is misinformation, widespread by academia. The solid Democratic South stayed Democrat up until the 1990‚Äôs.Scholars will argue that voters decided 30 years after the fact to turn against Democrats for LBJ signing the CRA, but that‚Äôs a highly illogical argument. Voters don‚Äôt wait 30 years to punish a party. There were other factors involved with regard to the south turning against Democrats in the 1990‚Äôs.  >Nearly unanimous approval from *Northern* Democrats and nearly unanimous **dis**approval from *Southern* Democrats. Now (totally coincidentally, apparently) the same region that voted very strongly against the CRA is deep red. It only started to become red 30 years after the fact. Those congressional Democrats that opposed the Civil Rights Act stayed Democrats and dominated the South up until the 1990‚Äôs.  >So Southern dems split, some staying with the national party (and now getting the advantage of black voters) while some left and joined the GOP, which was happy to have themWho were some of the southern Democrats that left and joined the GOP after LBJ took over? If we were to be historically accurate, it was only one Democrat that did so. The mass majority actually stayed Democrats, and dominated in the South as Democrats up until the 1990‚Äôs. Then the switch occurred.  >Southern conservatives clearly moved from the democrats in presidential elections after the civil rights act. If anything Carters election is the exception that proves the rule.The Presidential elections that Republicans won during that 30 year period consisted of massive landslides. Nixon won 49 of 50 states in 72‚Äô. Reagan won 49 out of 50 states in his re-election bid. Of course these candidates were going to win the South under those circumstances. >And as I said with regards to Congress, this was not a vote for the national Democratic Party but for individual southern conservative Dixiecrats - the move to the republicans was part of the same shift, it just took longer to filter down to a local level.We‚Äôre talking about Senators and House Representatives, not local level positions. No one is denying a shift happened with Democrats and the South. Just clearly there were other factors involved since it took 30 years after the Civil Rights Act passed. 30 years is just a long time for voters to look back and point to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for their switch in party affiliation. >The shift clearly happened after Civil Rights Congressional Democrats dominating the entirety of the South for 30 years after the Civil Rights Act passed contradicts this. Consider how long 30 years is. The Soviet Union existed 30 years ago. You wouldn‚Äôt say Trump won the U.S. Presidency after the Soviet Union fell. With regard to Presidential elections, Democrat Jimmy Carter won the entire South in a Presidential election in 1976. That was 12 years after the Civil Rights Legislation. Still, my entire point is that historically, it wasn‚Äôt until the 1990‚Äôs that Congressional Democrats lost their stronghold on the South.   >still simple way to look at it is that the constituency of southern conservatives used to be Democrats but moved to the Republicans after the Democrats embraced Civil Rights legislation.Congressional Democrats actually dominated in the South up until the 1990s. Not to mention, 80 percent of Congressional Republicans supported the 1964 Civil Rights Act compared to just 63 percent of Congressional Democrats. People like to point to the Civil Rights Legislation as a turning point for simplicity, but it‚Äôs not so black and white.  2. Banned.  Provided a good laugh. Strong slant against the protesters, and they even managed to find someone to quote that blames Trump for the protests. Gotta love CNN.  Where are you now, and after how long? Do you think if Trump publicly opposed the bill, it would still have as high of chance to pass in Congress as it does now? After any sort of physical altercation, sure.  Ah, I didn‚Äôt have the volume very high when I watched it last night.Even then, we still don‚Äôt 100 percent know that‚Äôs what took place but it‚Äôs definitely a fair assumption.  We really don‚Äôt know what took place prior. These headlines are usually nothing but clickbait.  I never said that all liberals want open borders.  My point is it isn‚Äôt accurate to argue there isn‚Äôt some significant support for it among the left.  The DNC Deputy Chair recently wore a t-shirt to a political event that said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe in borders.‚Äù This is common knowledge throughout conservative media, but you wouldn‚Äôt know it if you only listened to left-wing media.  There are advocates of open borders in top positions within the Democratic Party. It‚Äôs not just something conservative media claims.  Honestly only because the media will turn against him.  You need teeth or something mimicking teeth in the space to preserve the bone. The best scenario is having a large enough jaw for your wisdom teeth to grow into to. Having too little space or impacted wisdom teeth can cause bone loss and gum disease so getting yours removed was likely for the best long-term.  Yup. Mostly in the maxilla, moving towards the back of the jaw. Nothing crazy though.Go look at pictures of people that have lost multiple teeth and never received treatment. They experience major bone loss throughout the jaw. That‚Äôs the extreme, of course.  The x-rays of my mouth before vs after getting all four wisdom teeth removed shows some bone loss in the surrounding area that they were. More so on the top.  I loved all those great snow days back in early ‚Äò15, which was my first year here in Fayetteville. Really hoping we get it again this year.  Who is they? I have a job.  There‚Äôs only two Republican Senators up for re-election in 2020 from states that Clinton won in 2016.I‚Äôm not trying to scare you or anything. No need to insult people for stating observable facts.  Who thought the Dems had a chance at the Senate following the 2016 results? Gerrymandering won‚Äôt affect the electoral college, or any statewide races for that matter. The Democrats also not being able win statewide in Florida during a so called ‚Äúblue wave‚Äù election makes people like me think last night showed why Republicans will likely win on 2020.  I‚Äôm with you. As a partisan of the right, I actually feel good about last night. Senate map looks great for the GOP in 2020 as well.  >Unfortunately a wall would do nothing to change that. Just understand this is your opinion. Border patrol agents overwhelmingly say a wall is needed to reduce unlawful border crossings. It‚Äôs fully your right to believe they‚Äôre ignorant and uninformed for their stance. That goes both ways, though.  Cite the relevant section of the CBO report that says *illegal* immigrants contribute more in tax revenue than they take out. That‚Äôs all I want, and this debate can be over.  >Calm down. I'm not an authority, neither are you. I'm just presenting what real authorities and statistics say. What you‚Äôre failing to comprehend is that the authorities on border security, as I just sourced. say a wall is needed to secure the border. This means your argument that a wall isn‚Äôt needed is contradicts what our experts say. Since you‚Äôre an advocate of illegal immigration, including tax revenue from *legal* immigrants dilutes the results as to whether illegal immigrants take in less than they put in.I realize that being a leftist, you have trouble distinguishing between legal and illegal immigration. There is indeed a difference. As I said, estimates say only about half of illegal immigrants pay a federal income tax. For those that do, their general annual earnings only barely exceed the standard deduction. Their tax liability is generally low and they subsequently pay very little in income taxes. It‚Äôs fine that you‚Äôre an advocate for illegal immigration. I just think it‚Äôs important to understand the implications, and to not muddy the waters by including data pertaining to legal immigrants when determining illegal immigrants‚Äô contributions in tax revenue.  >Many of the rest are just smuggled through the normal entry places(via trucks, planes, and boats) although many also use ladders or walking which a wall would slow but not stop.The implication being that most of unlawful border crossings stem from this. Do you have any evidence at all of this, or are you just making this up?>So there are plenty of other avenues for people to enter the country that the wall doesn't stop and that are even more expensive to address if you are trying to stop all illegal entry.[Border patrol agents overwhelmingly support building a wall.](https://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/apr/2/border-patrol-agents-back-trump-wall-survey-finds/) They are the ones who‚Äôs everyday job it is to keep the border secure.What in the hell makes you think you‚Äôre more qualified on this issue than them? >[‚Äúin aggregate and over the long term, tax revenues of all types generated by immigrants‚Äîboth legal and unauthorized‚Äîexceed the cost of the services they use."](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/110th-congress-2007-2008/reports/12-6-immigration.pdf) Now you‚Äôre justifying 50 percent of legal and illegal immigrants being on welfare. Not a good look.Illegal immigrants also do not pay more taxes than they take out. [Source.](https://fairus.org/issue/publications-resources/fiscal-burden-illegal-immigration-united-states-taxpayers) It‚Äôs estimated that only about half even pay federal income taxes. The fact that you justify them being on welfare shows your true colors, and true leftist intentions. >And the point you make is unequivocally false. The entire country is desperate for unskilled workers and has been for a while. [Source](https://globalriskinsights.com/2017/09/labor-shortage-united-states-dire-issue/). Not to say that won't change but currently you are very much wrong and there is no clear indication that that will change anytime soon.It is not unequivocally false that we‚Äòre moving into an automated economy. This isn‚Äôt 1960 communist Soviet Union. We have a highly industrialized economy that will be heavily automated within the next 20 years and thus moved well on from relying on an unskilled workforce. The fact that you‚Äôre lying to not only me but yourself about widespread automation not being real is just laughable. Autonomous cars are already a thing. Drop the propaganda angle. Automation is real.  I‚Äôll give you a quick rundown. Most illegal immigrants came from unlawfully crossing the border. [Source. ](https://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2018/aug/24/kevin-mccarthy/mostly-true-visa-overstays-account-half-all-people/) The talking point you‚Äôve invoked of most having arrived from visa overstays isn‚Äôt back up by any estimates. You‚Äôre advocating giving 25 billion to poor and corrupt socialist governments. That‚Äôs a joke. We already give those countries millions in aid each year. It hasn‚Äôt helped. Ending birthright citizenship will end birth tourism. It would also decrease the number of legal and illegal immigrants currently on welfare. Current estimates say about 50 percent of legal and illegal immigrants are on some sort of welfare. [Source.](https://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2017/aug/14/david-perdue/sen-david-perdue-half-immigrant-households-benefit/) This stems from the exploitation of birthright citizenship. They become eligible for welfare after having children who automatically get citizenship. We already take in a million immigrants each year. I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about when you say we have to increase our quotas, but no other country on the planet comes close to us with regard to annual immigration numbers. That is a fact.We also don‚Äôt need more unskilled laborers. I know you all want the votes, but as we move into a more automated economy, their labor becomes more obsolete.  >And "every single midterm election since 2006" is literally two midterm elections, 2010 and 2014.Every midterm election since the year 2006 is 4 midterms. I know it‚Äôs getting late, but lmao. Democrats underperformed the average in 2006. I mistakenly thought Republicans over performed the average in 2010, but they did over performed the average generic ballot in 2014. I‚Äôm not sure if the GOP over performed the average generic ballot tonight, but there‚Äôs a good chance.  I feel like I‚Äôm reading something from a high school intern working on a Democrat campaign. Maybe if I‚Äôm up to it tomorrow I‚Äôll respond and correct you on basically all of this nonsense.  I don‚Äôt believe that talking point is true. Last estimate I looked at showed that around 40 percent of illegal immigrants in the United States overstayed their visas.  I don‚Äôt know how it would be the opposite. Prospective amnesty is an incentive for illegal immigration. If you were planning to illegally immigrate to the United States, knowing amnesty was soon to be passed would incentivize you to make the trip sooner than later.  It‚Äôs not a talking point. It‚Äôs an inconvenient fact for proponents of polling but it‚Äôs stood true in every single midterm since 2006. Every single average of generic ballot polling for midterms since 2006 oversampled Democrats. You‚Äôre not a pollster. Neither am I, but I at least understand there‚Äôs a methodology in sampling. Sampling errors are presumably what causes this. Biased pollsters are a possibility as well.  Compare the RCP average to the final results. Blackburn‚Äôs margin ended up being 5 points greater than what the RCP average showed, for example. Compare the numbers for all the races I mentioned above, and you‚Äôll understand what I‚Äôm saying better.  You‚Äôre forgetting about a lot of races. Blackburn‚Äôs Senate victory in Tennessee, Donnely‚Äôs defeat, Stacy Abrams got trounced, and every other GOP gain in the Senate.  Getting the border secured would drop unlawful border crossings substantially. Ending amnesty plans and birthright citizenship would also kill much of the incentives illegal immigrants have in coming here. Democrats (since the last decade) oppose all of that, essentially because ‚Äúdemographics are destiny.‚Äù  It would be glorious. I‚Äôm not getting my hopes up yet but it‚Äôs clear that the polls were heavily oversampling Democrats. This isn‚Äôt anything new, of course. The GOP would have a mandate if this happens, and hopefully it leads to an illegal immigration solution. Still, not getting my hopes up.  That needle was an absolute roller coaster last election.  >Subsequently, Munri-Leighton recanted her charge and admitted she had never met Kavanaugh. "I was angry, and I sent it out," she said.She admitted she made it up. It‚Äôs right in the article. Either you didn‚Äôt actually read it or have problems with comprehension. Take your pick.  It wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it is by far the best system of governance ever crafted.  As I just said above to your identical comment, he wasn‚Äôt ideal, but certainly a ton better than a liberal activist on the Court. Don‚Äôt pretend the Patriot Act is an issue on just one side of aisle.  Why not just read articles before commenting on them? Things would make so much more sense for you.  If you believe interpreting the Constitution and legal statutes in the manner they were originally intended makes one an activist on the bench, sure. It‚Äôs never been Originalists who‚Äôve made the argument the Constitution is a living, breathing document. He wasn‚Äôt ideal, but certainly a ton better than a liberal activist on the Court.  >I guess the main difference is, none of the examples you listed above used their positions in the media to actively and blatantly promote a candidate. It‚Äôs actually really hard not to feel bad for someone who actually believes this. Maybe you‚Äôre really young, and just started following politics this year?The national media actively promoted and covered for Obama throughout his entire tenure as Presidential candidate and President. https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/rich-noyes/2018/11/04/flashback-obamas-first-midterm-media-resisted-end-one-party-ruleThe link addresses media coverage prior to the  2010 midterms, before Democrats were slated to lose many seats in Congress. It includes quotes from journalists and even reporters promoting Obama and in some cases criticizing voters for not approving of Obama better. Examples:> ‚ÄùThe public panned it. Republicans obstructed it. Many Democrats fled from it. Even so, the session of Congress now drawing to a close was the most productive in nearly half a century.

Voting as soon as I get out of class today. Can not wait.  Just an FYI, Republicans are expected to gain additional seats in the Senate. This increases the odds of them getting another Originalist on the Supreme Court within the next two years. It‚Äôs certainly not all doom and gloom for them if they lose the House majority by a few seats.  Did Ford admit to making false rape allegations, which is what this article addresses? You should read it first before blindly commenting.  What I want to happen: Democrats win 20 seats in the House. Republicans pick up an additional 4 seats in the Senate.What I think will happen: Democrats win ~28 seats. Republicans gain an additional seat in the Senate. If the election were 3 weeks ago, I believe the former would happen. Democrats and the media turned the narrative around against the GOP and Trump since then.  False rape allegations are one of the most deplorable ways to end someone‚Äôs life. I think it‚Äôs fully justified to cite them while addressing the importance of due process.If you read the title through partisan lenses, that‚Äôs your issue. Not Reason‚Äôs.  Getting angry about the kill is one thing. The gunshot is what‚Äôs entirely illogical. >Just 3 in 10 voters, 30 percent, said Trump has done more to unite the country, compared with 56 percent who said he‚Äôs done more to divide it. Even more voters, 64 percent, said the media have done more to divide the country, while only 17 percent say they have done more to unite it.It‚Äôs not complicated. 64 percent of voters say the media have done more to divide the country vs unite it; compared to 56 who say Trump has more to divide vs unite it. This means more voters say the media is divisive compared to the President.  Trump is a citizen. This dude is a moron.  My quote above actually includes 3 studies total, not sure why you felt the need to lie about that.Obama was referencing shootings when he claimed there was systemic racism in our police. I‚Äôm just saying *most* studies show it does not exist. It‚Äôs a partisan narrative used by Democrats and the national media for electoral purposes. I still don‚Äôt agree that you can put the death of those 5 officer‚Äôs at their feet though. Individuals make their own decisions when they kill. Unless national figures directly call for the murders of certain groups, you can‚Äôt blame them. Also, 2 more studies showing systemic racial profiling does not exist:>But aren't blacks routinely "racially profiled" by cops? Not according to the Police-Public Contact Survey. Produced every three years by the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics, the survey asks more than 60,000 people about their interactions with the police. It asks respondents' to provide age, race and gender. It asks them whether they had any contact with the police in the last year; what was the experience like; how were your treated; was there a use of force and so on. Turns out, according to a September 2017 National Review article, black men and white men are about equally likely to have a contact with a cop in a given year. >There's also the National Crime Victimization Survey, which questions victims of crimes, whether or not the criminal was captured, as to the race and ethnicity of the suspect. It turns out that the race of the arrested matches the percentage given by victims. So unless victims are lying about the race of their assailant, unconcerned about whether he gets caught, blacks are not being "overarrested."https://www.creators.com/read/larry-elder/06/18/criminal-behavior-not-racism-explains-racial-disparities-in-crime-stats Most studies conclude the disparity stems from criminal behavior, not racism.> In the study "Is There Evidence of Racial Disparity in Police Use of Deadly Force?" professors from Michigan State and Arizona State universities analyzed officer-involved fatal shootings in 2015 and 2016. The report's abstract says: "We benchmark two years of fatal shooting data on 16 crime rate estimates. When adjusting for crime, we find no systematic evidence of anti-black disparities in fatal shootings, fatal shootings of unarmed citizens, or fatal shootings involving misidentification of harmless objects. ... Exposure to police given crime rate differences likely accounts for the higher per capita rate of fatal police shootings for blacks, at least when analyzing all shootings. For unarmed shootings or misidentification shootings, data are too uncertain to be conclusive.">Two recent studies found cops more reluctant to use deadly force against blacks, including one by a black Harvard economist. Professor Roland G. Fryer Jr. concluded: "On the most extreme use of force ‚Äî officer-involved shootings ‚Äî we find no racial differences in either the raw data or when contextual factors are taken into account."https://www.creators.com/read/larry-elder/06/18/criminal-behavior-not-racism-explains-racial-disparities-in-crime-statsI also do not blame Obama for those 5 officers‚Äô deaths. I just find it appalling that partisans like to blame their political opposition in similar circumstances but never their own when the shoe is on the other foot. >However there is an obvious difference when an unhinged person snaps and commits a crime that is motivated by actual problems, than one who does so from motivation based on pure fantasy. Wouldn't you agree?Again, most studies disprove the notion that police are systematically racist. Your opinion articles from Vox and the Washington Post don‚Äôt carry much weight. I also find your subtle justification here not surprising, considering what team you‚Äôre on.  That definitely counts. Very poor statement to make, and I can see why his opposition would pounce on it.  What do you not understand about this? Where has he said ‚Äúall negative coverage of me is fake news.‚ÄùRead it a couple of times before responding. Do what you have to do. This really isn‚Äôt complicated.  You mean after Obama claimed our police were systemically racist, a claim not backed up by evidence, and a BLM supporter soon after went on to murder 5 Dallas police officers?  I‚Äôm questioning the dubious claim by the left that Trump claims all negative coverage of him is fake news.I‚Äôm questioning it because I believe the left is full of it when they make it. I‚Äôm open to being proved wrong, though. Cite the evidence.  Where does he say that all negative coverage of him is fake news? It‚Äôs a simple question. He doesn‚Äôt say it in that quote, in case you were wondering.  >very obvious examples of acts of violence and terror from the right, in a three day period, most of which can easily be traced back to rhetoric promoted by Trump. When has Trump called for mail bombings against Democrats? Cite evidence if you‚Äôre going to make such a hysterical claim. A Bernie supporter also nearly killed the House majority whip. He was put in critical condition. By your flawed logic, the mail bombings are a false equivalence, as no Democrat politicians were injured. Both sides are not the same here.  >Or is all negative coverage worthy of being called ‚Äúfake news‚Äù as Trump has said in the past?Do you have any evidence that Trump has actually said this? My gut feeling is that you literally made this up, and are ironically spreading fake news about the President.  Your preconceived conclusion that people exploiting birth tourism are generally rich is not derived from evidence. I‚Äôm sure there are some who come legally from other continents that are wealthy, but there are also many that come illegally from our southern border. [The latter is why it‚Äôs estimated that 50 percent of illegal and legal immigrant households receive some kind of welfare benefit.](https://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2017/aug/14/david-perdue/sen-david-perdue-half-immigrant-households-benefit/) They are indeed exploiting our system and costing our tax payers millions.  The reason virtually no right-leaning hosts exist on MSNBC or CNN is because their audience has alternatives to flip to and would therefore not tolerate it. Fox News viewers are generally more tolerable of divergent hosts because they have less alternatives. Shep probably pisses off much of the audience, but they aren‚Äôt going to flip to CNN when they get tired of him. You completely missed my point. Conservatives would be more willing to compromise on welfare state policies if we could end issues like birth tourism. Ending birth tourism would free up a significant amount of funds we allocate towards the welfare of illegal immigrant households.  >Diplomats? They were Erdogan‚Äôs bodyguards.Could they be granted diplomatic immunity or security immunity?>And, I didn‚Äôt say they‚Äôre never liable. I said *as long as they‚Äôre shielded by their country*.That‚Äôs all my point is. They can still be subject to U.S. jurisdiction, but they are not ‚Äúsubject to the jurisdiction thereof‚Äù as defined in the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment. I‚Äôm not even saying illegal immigrants are definitively not subject to birthright citizenship. My point is it‚Äôs ignorant to argue there is no gray area in the matter.  More conservatives with be more willing to compromise on those sort of policies if we could put an end to birth tourism here in the U.S.  They are obviously two different people. Even with these low-res shots, you can tell their chins are very different. This is idiotic.  Where do you think these exceptions for foreign diplomats and enemies are articulated in the birthright citizenship clause? You‚Äôre apparently claiming that the exceptions are not from the phrase ‚Äúsubject to the jurisdiction thereof.‚Äù This is of course historically inaccurate and very ignorant. In reality, that phrase wasn‚Äôt added for shits and giggles, and does indicate exceptions for birthright citizenship. Where in the text are these exceptions mentioned? Back up your argument.  In the text, the exceptions for birthright citizenship that exists at a minimum for foreign diplomats strictly derives from the phrase ‚Äúsubject to the jurisdiction thereof.‚Äù You do understand that, correct?>Foreign diplomats and families enjoy diplomatic immunity and are not held under US jurisdiction as long as they‚Äôre shielded by their country.You‚Äôre also misinformed if you think foreign diplomats are never liable for breaking US laws. [For example, the United States recently charged 15 Turkish Diplomats for breaking US laws.](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-turkey-erdogan-indictments-20170829-story.html)  ‚ÄúSubject to the jurisdiction thereof‚Äù wasn‚Äôt added to the text for shits and giggles. Senator Jacob Howard, the author of the text, clarified that it exempted foreigners, aliens and diplomats, and this is your response:>Which is nice, but that's not in the text of the amendment itself that was ratified by 2/3s of congress, so it's also kind of irreleventWhat a joke.  It‚Äôs already settled law that ‚Äúsubject to the jurisdiction thereof‚Äù excludes foreign diplomats and foreign enemies. Are foreign diplomats and enemies subject to U.S. laws? Of course, but they are not ‚Äúsubject to the jurisdiction thereof‚Äù as defined in the 14th Amendment. The author of the 14th Amendment‚Äôs Citizenship Clause himself said this:>This will not, of course, include persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the Government of the United States, but will include every other class of persons. It‚Äôs not unconditional because this isn‚Äôt settled law. His EO will force the matter to the Supreme Court.  It‚Äôs already settled law that ‚Äúsubject to the jurisdiction thereof‚Äù excludes foreign diplomats and foreign enemies. Are foreign diplomats and enemies subject to U.S. laws? Of course, but they are not ‚Äúsubject to the jurisdiction thereof‚Äù as defined in the 14th Amendment.

It‚Äôs already settled that ‚Äúsubject to the jurisdiction thereof‚Äù excludes foreign diplomats and enemies. Are foreign diplomats and enemies subject to U.S. laws? Of course, but they are not ‚Äúsubject to the jurisdiction thereof‚Äù as defined in the 14th Amendment. To not understand this off the bat makes me question your claims of having a law degree. The author of the 14th Amendment‚Äôs Citizenship Clause himself said this:>This will not, of course, include persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the Government of the United States, but will include every other class of persons. I genuinely love debating leftists. I just think it‚Äôs a shame when they derive a community of its identity through their superior numbers here on Reddit.  I love debating you leftists. I just think it‚Äôs a shame when you all derive a host community of its identity through brigades.  Banning brigade efforts on an Internet forum does not violate free speech.  There are legal scholars, with likely more experience in law than you, who do in fact believe it is a legal gray area. The argument is the phrase ‚Äúsubject to the legal jurisdiction‚Äù in the 14th Amendment dictates a particular legal threshold. > One scholar who supports Paul‚Äôs view is John C. Eastman, a law professor at Chapman University.>Without getting too far into the weeds, Eastman and others who share his view see the 14th Amendment phrase "subject to the jurisdiction" of the United States as pivotal.

Trump can do this, and there will be lawsuits filed. Then it goes to the Supreme Court.  >Imagine being so fucking stupid to believe that anything but a Constitutional Amendment could change constitutionally established requirements for citizenship.Imaging being ‚Äúso fucking stupid‚Äù you make this comment without understanding the issue of birthright citizenship applying to illegal immigrants was in fact a legal gray area, and had yet to be adjudicated by the Supreme Court. We don‚Äôt have to imagine. We just have to read your comment.  What makes you think you‚Äôre the adjudicator of that? It should be up to the Constitution, and the Supreme Court.  Ron Paul opposes birthright citizenship:>RAMOS: As you know, children of undocumented immigrants who are born in the United States are citizens Is that ok?>PAUL: I just think the mere fact of stepping across the border and having a child‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand I‚Äôm an O.B. doctor and I‚Äôve had to take a lot emergency deliveries and people came for the sole purpose of that. No, I don‚Äôt think that should be automatic.

What does ‚Äúunder the jurisdiction‚Äù mean? If you‚Äôre illegal, you might not be considered under the jurisdiction of the U.S. government.I‚Äôd really enjoy seeing the leftists who‚Äôve taken over this sub argue Ron Paul isn‚Äôt a real libertarian. What do you leftists say? So then you‚Äôre openly part of the brigade. Congrats you little leftist, you all have decisively taken over this sub.  Well to be fair, you‚Äôre a leftist parading as a libertarian. Your comment should be dully noted.  >Obama was NOT encouraging  his supporters to beat up people Yes he did. You‚Äôre either a liar, or uninformed. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RYM6UjwwP90 I agree with all of those except the CATO study. There‚Äôs been conflicting studies but I believe supply and demand holds true even in unskilled labor markets. Here‚Äôs the results from a conflicting study:>The regression equations indicate that even after controlling for a variety of factors, immigrants exert a downward pressure on both the weekly and hourly wages of natives. When all natives are considered together, the wage effects of immigration appear to be relatively modest. However, when the results are disaggregated and lowskilled occupations are examined separately, the results indicate that immigrants have a significant negative effect on the wages of natives in these occupations, while having no such effect on natives employed in higher-skilled occupations. (For the purposes of this study, low-skilled occupations are defined as those performed on average by workers with no more than a high school degree.)https://cis.org/Report/Wages-Immigration I‚Äôm actually referring to unskilled workers. If you have any information that claims an influx of unskilled workers is good for the U.S. economy, paste the relevant section. I‚Äôm honestly not just clicking through multiple links.  >Because I think you‚Äôre lying. It‚Äôs very transparent to me. If you weren‚Äôt lying, and you were banned simply for saying that quoted comment, you would post the screenshot, and I would believe you.https://i.imgur.com/YCLp9An.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/sceYOE9.png So will you concede that r/politics unjustly bans people for criticizing the left if I post it, and not immediately backpedal on my comment unjustly deserving a ban? As industrialization progresses further, we will move more into an automated economy. Automation will replace more unskilled positions. Automated processes will indeed also replace human workers in many service sectors. Adding a massive influx of unskilled workers to our economy also drives down wages for current unskilled workers. This is basic supply and demand. As you rapidly increase the supply of something while demand remains relatively stable, the price decreases. The price in this case is the wage rate paid to workers. This is why I believe letting them all in is an economically illiterate thing to do. I still do sympathize with them of course, and understand why others may want to give them a chance at the so called American dream. It is important to understand the economic implications, though.  I respect your sincerity. I may not agree with letting into our country a large group of unskilled workers that can‚Äôt speak English, but you being upfront about your honest position is honorable. I wish more in the Democratic Party and national media would do the same.  >I‚Äôm not gullible for thinking humans can overcome great obstacles, you‚Äôre just a giant pussy who can‚Äôt fathom having to sustain oneself without money to give you purchasing power.You‚Äôre someone that calls people ‚Äúgiant pussy‚Äù on the internet. Grow the fuck up.  I‚Äôm just going to copy and paste my previous comment. Problems reading today?> This is true. The trail of tears come to mind, because it‚Äôs a similar distance traveled. It‚Äôs estimated that up to half of the 16,000 participants died along the way. Most from starvation.  That poll is over a month old. The one I posted is from this week. You said recently polling shows unequivocally the number one issue with Americans is not the economy. So which recent polling were you referring to? Your disbelief that that comment would justify a ban says it all. I‚Äôm not taking the time to upload a screenshot to imgur. It‚Äôs really not that important.This sub is also not r/politics. Obviously, since I was perma-banned from there for the above comment.  Just went through my messages. This r/politics mod said this comment was why I was banned:>I just don't understand how the left takes all these L's continuously. Why do you guys keeps losing? Bullshit. If you criticize the left on r/politics, you will be banned.  According to the [NBC poll](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/nbc-wsj-poll-democrats-hold-nine-point-advantage-midterm-elections-n922266) released this week, the economy is in fact the number one issue for voters right now:>Asked which one or two issues would be the most important factor in deciding their vote, 38 percent said the economy and jobs; 31 percent said health care, 23 percent said changing how things work; and 22 percent each said looking out for the middle class and immigration. Voters also overwhelmingly trust Republicans to handle the economy over Democrats:>The poll also finds Republicans with a 15-point advantage on the question of which party better deals with the economy ‚Äî their biggest lead on this question in the poll‚Äôs history.>Forty-three percent of registered voters say the GOP better handles the economy, while 28 percent pick the Democrats; the GOP held a 14-point edge on this question in August.https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/nbc-wsj-poll-democrats-hold-nine-point-advantage-midterm-elections-n922266 >I AM saying walking long distances without financial backing is %100 possible and has been done before. And I just told you that while it has been done, most usually die from starvation and disease. Read my prior comment again.  >Thinking logically- does one need hiking shoes to walk? You need shoes to walk 1,000 miles, yes. Do you believe you can walk 1,000 miles in sandals? >I‚Äôm making a point that this is not as impossible as lazy Americans are making it out to be.Speak for yourself. Gullible liberals under the impression that 7,500 impoverished Central Americans can afford traveling 3 months on foot without any income are nothing short of laughable. Logic should be telling you that many would die from starvation if that were the case.  >I mean, people have gone on long pilgrimages through out history without billionaires backing them.This is true. The trail of tears come to mind, because it‚Äôs a similar distance traveled. It‚Äôs estimated that up to half of the 16,000 participants died along the way. Most from starvation. >Costs of food and water- Savings- these ppl could‚Äôve saved food for months to prepare. They could possibly forage or hunt. Kind strangers could feed them, churches could feed them, They probably are extremely hungry.This caravan includes up to 7,500 impoverished people from Central America. Churches are not feeding 7,500 people. Many do not have hiking shoes or even luggage. To assume each person has saved up nearly 1,000 equivalent U.S. dollars to afford making this 3 month trip is ludicrous.  Did you really just go weeks back in my comment history in order to refute my argument? Meaning your gut reaction after reading my post was to scroll though my comment history?>I had a real response formulatedNo you didn‚Äôt. You‚Äôve essentially said you‚Äôd rather just change the subject now.  The economy is the most considerable metric to use when determining whether a country is declining. The only reason you find it funny for others to point it out is because there‚Äôs virtually no argument to propagate indicating a downtown. Speaking of Obama, he was the first U.S. President to not reach 3 percent annual GDP growth. Trump is projected to hit over 3 percent annual GDP growth this fiscal year. It‚Äôll be the first time for the U.S. to reach it in over 13 years.There‚Äôs a reason Democrats don‚Äôt even argue the country is in decline. It‚Äôs a very ignorant argument to make right now. This is a new boom period.  Why is a days old NBC article from their Latino section more credible than the United States‚Äô Department of Homeland Security? You have to consider expenses for food and water. Walking on foot for 75 consecutive days would be exhausting. The costs of food for that amount time without working is not something just anyone could afford. That‚Äôs the broader point you seem to be missing.  Under which economic metric is the country getting worse? For example, the current 3.7 unemployment rate is the lowest on record in 50 years.  So you believe the 5,000 asylum seekers have self-funded their 3 month hike to the U.S.? Try to think about how much money one person would need, and the economic status of these people. For example, many couldn‚Äôt afford hiking shoes or even luggage. Think logically about this.  Thousands of people aren‚Äôt able to just leave their jobs and travel on foot for 3 months without someone funding the expenses. It‚Äôs very obvious that big money is being funneled into this caravan circus.  Of course there are legitimate stories. There‚Äôs also a selection bias of which stories to focus on. There‚Äôs word choice bias that deliberately makes the audience react a certain way. Then there‚Äôs the misleading stories, and of course outright fake news stories. Do you genuinely believe the mainstream media doesn‚Äôt engage in reporting of false news stories against Trump and conservatives in general? >Statements like "don't believe what you see" and "enemy of the people" are detrimental to representative democracy. I wouldn't call that mindless hysteriaTelling his constituents not to believe what they see on cable news is a very fair statement considering 90 percent of his coverage by the mainstream news is negative, yet 47 percent of Americans approve of his performance as President. That‚Äôs an astonishing disparity, don‚Äôt you think?This is the root of the hysteria. What leftists see and hear from their news outlets, and what actually materializes in real life are so disparate that they can‚Äôt rationalize it.[This is why we have leftists protesters pounding on the doors of the Supreme Court. ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8q-v7eCZCN4)  >determination is made largely by judges, not bureaucrats. An asylum officer, who works for DHS, usually makes the initial determination for who qualifies for asylum. Then it moves to a judge. Though there is also a process called Affirmative Asylum, where DHS grants asylum to applicants outright. Just so you understand the process here. >It must be a terrifying world for you. Speak for yourself. Leftists like you operate under the mindset that the United States is ran by a dictator. You people thrive off of mindless hysteria. It's not as concerning knowing who's in power right now. The majority of the caravan will not be permitted into the country, because of who controls the Executive Branch.  &#x200B;Once the pendulum swings, and leftists get into power, all of this changes. The definition of asylum could very well change from "fleeing persecution" to "wanting to achieve the American Dream." Take note of how leftists in this thread are justifying the caravan. They realize it's mostly economic incentives driving them here, and they are fine with that.  A top-ranking national Democrat publicly saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe in borders‚Äù is as explicit as it gets. Nice propagandist spin though. Reminds me of something CNN would muster up.  There‚Äôs substantial evidence he is. He literally wore a t-shirt to a political event that said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe in borders.‚ÄùHow does someone like you, with the argument you‚Äôve made that you‚Äôre so sure of, rationalize that fact? I believe the DNC deputy chair is an open advocate of open borders.  I literally laughed out loud at their comment.  >So it's not data about illegal immigrants. The first source is government data showing the percentage of both legal and illegal immigrant households that use welfare. I also provided explanations as to how they use welfare services. It‚Äôs all very clear and comprehensible. Are you still confused at this point? >Using data from the Census Bureau‚Äôs Survey of Income and Program Participation, the study found that in 2012, 51 percent of immigrant-headed households **(living here legally or illegally)** reported having used at least one welfare program during the year, compared with 30 percent of native-born households.http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2017/aug/14/david-perdue/sen-david-perdue-half-immigrant-households-benefit/Illegal immigrant households receive welfare support such as SNAP so long as they have children born here. [Illegal immigrants receive access to federal emergency Medicaid, to the amount of 5 billion dollars a year, regardless of their children‚Äôs or spouses‚Äôs citizenship.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2018/02/26/how-american-citizens-finance-health-care-for-undocumented-immigrants/#1dce7f5f12c4) State-funded benefits can also indiscriminately be eligible to illegal immigrants.  Which part of my comment specifically do you believe is mistaken? That illegal immigrants are generally unskilled low-income workers? Try being specific. If you‚Äôre tempted to argue they‚Äôre doctors and lawyers, be a man and make that argument. I‚Äôm always up for a good laugh.  Estimates say only about half of illegal immigrants in the United States pay an income tax. For those that do contribute in paying an income tax instead of getting compensated under the table, they aren‚Äôt contributing much.Illegal immigrants are generally unskilled low-income earners. If their annual income does exceed the standard deduction, it‚Äôs not by much. It‚Äôs simply not realistic to say illegal immigrants are middle to upper class and earning high incomes that subsequently contribute large amounts of tax revenue.  >I'm afraid to file for all of these storied welfare entitlements lest anyone take notice that I'm in the country "illegally".Many do get welfare entitlements. Ditch this idea that they don‚Äôt, because it‚Äôs a misinformed position. > I don't know anything about Honduras but I'm pretty sure they just want that welfare they won't ever be eligible for.You‚Äôre highly uninformed if you think illegal immigrants aren‚Äôt eligible for welfare. They‚Äôre eligible in an array of ways. > I don't know anythingYou could have just ended your comment right here and been fine.  I do live in a small college town, and it is usually younger people that do this to me when I‚Äôm driving my Cayman. I‚Äôve been here for 5 years though, and never experienced this at this scale until I bought my Cayman last month.In fact the only reason I‚Äôve decided against selling my truck is because of this. I can‚Äôt deal with the anxiety of road enraged drivers bluffing to wreck into my Porsche on a daily basis. With my truck, this behavior just doesn‚Äôt happen often.  You‚Äôd have a point if I didn‚Äôt drive both vehicles in the same city, and both at the speed limit.  This bill only adds increased penalties for illegal acts committed while wearing masks, such as injuring or threatening people. It doesn‚Äôt touch freedom of assembly.  Has it really been all fantasy these past couple of years? You generally can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs like the old saying; to anger a conservative, lie to them. To anger a liberal, tell them the truth.  Triggering liberals is what keeps politics entertaining. It‚Äôs actually rather crucial considering how stressful following the news cycle everyday can be.  If Democrats were upfront with their actual political intentions, they would never win elections outside of the coasts. Whether it‚Äôs raising taxes, opposing immigration laws, banning firearms, impeaching the President; they always try to keep quiet in regard to their policy goals. It‚Äôs also unfortunate we have a national media that‚Äôs too corrupt and partisan to press them on these issues.  That painting is badass. Would love to get one for myself honestly.  Don‚Äôt play fucking stupid. They cover their faces for purposes of avoiding criminal liability towards the unlawful tactics they engage in.  I‚Äôm talking about assets in general being seized. As I said before, I‚Äôm only inquiring where you draw the line with regard to when taking one‚Äôs assets is no longer is considered theft. Not trying to be confusing, and I tried to construct my previous comment in the most straight-forward manner possible to get a clear answer from you. Instead, I got a series of questions. >...again, do you think taxes are redistributed amongst the tax payers like some sort of dividend check? If you want to get technical, sure. They can be. First of all, I‚Äôm an accountant. It is actually possible to qualify for certain tax credits that will give you a negative tax liability, of which the government pays you in cash.  >Further, you seem to want to ignore that the community doesn't only take. They also give. That would true, if you completely ignore my previous comment where I said this:>**Presumably everyone in the community has had their physical goods or signs seized at one point or another.**>Are you under the impression that tax money is given back to each individual at an even level? Like a dividend or something? This sign wasn't distributed evenly. Half of it was taken by one person from another. Half was taken and the sign was damaged and, presumably, one other person has half a sign. I‚Äôm only trying to come to understanding where you draw the line with regard to when taking one‚Äôs assets is no longer is considered theft.So far the conditions you‚Äôve laid out are it must be the collective community that seizes the assets, it must redistributed among said community, and the assets must be currency. I understand your point, and am only trying to get your perspective. Perhaps make you think somewhat as well. Let me know if I‚Äôm missing anything else.  I see what you‚Äôre saying. The underlying condition that absolves the concept of theft from the scenario is if the collective community takes currency rather than physical goods.>Further, this is a scenario where the individual takes something to enrich themselves with part of a damaged good. With taxation, that isn't the case. They're not taking it simply to enrich themselves or others without adding a benefit that gets to those that have paid taxes.This still applies in my hypothetical sign scenario. Presumably everyone in the community has had their physical goods or signs seized at one point or another. The fact that it‚Äôs distributed evenly also suggests it‚Äôs not enriching one individual.  >Because this is an individual taking something from someone for themselves. So what you‚Äôre arguing is so long as this was the collective community taking the sign rather than one individual person, and they shared the sign among each other, it‚Äôs no longer theft? Can you articulate what exactly makes this theft rather than redistribution? Is it because the original sign owner didn‚Äôt consent to having someone take half? Yeah, I agree with you. Redistributing what I acquired on my accord is theft.  You‚Äôve gone through OP‚Äôs and now mine. Why else would you randomly call me a ‚ÄúTrumpette‚Äù when I haven‚Äôt discussed Trump whatsoever in this thread.Maybe you‚Äôre not a leftist, but you‚Äôre definitely a piss-poor liar.  Swarming through people‚Äôs comment history in an attempt to defeat their argument is a philosophical leftist tactic. If you don‚Äôt want to get called out for acting like a leftist, I suggest you drop that petty shit.  You sound like a cliche leftist. Arguments such as yours here are precisely why the left is losing.  You aren‚Äôt thinking critically. You‚Äôre rather engaging in the fallacy of personal attacks. You‚Äôre declaring the study is flawed because of who posted it on this sub-Reddit. It‚Äôs laughable.  If you have criticisms towards the study, feel free to articulate them. What you‚Äôre doing is petty and reflects poorly on your intellectualism.  If you don‚Äôt want to read the study, don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs that simple. Don‚Äôt get pissed on the apparent sole basis that others are being exposed to it. I just really don‚Äôt understand why people like you are clutching your pearls so hard in this thread. Aren‚Äôt there about 100 other things you should be mad about right now? Does this study upset you? Chill the fuck out, this was big news of the day. It relates to the economic policies their home countries embody, along the general economic status that illegal immigrants hold. It was merely fate that they would go on to vote for the economically left-wing political party.  Reddit isn‚Äôt an accurate representation of normal people.  Of course demographics matter when it comes to a conservative state voting for a leftist candidate.  It‚Äôs gonna be glorious.  They contacted everyone Ford claims was at the party. None had any recollection of it.  Not at all. Two different users made this exact comment to me:> innocent until proven guilty>This is a principle in the court of law, when it comes to applying criminal penalty. Why do you ignore this distinction, making generalized statements in the process? Even if he is stripped of his nomination, he is innocent. It has little bearing on the discussion.>**It's a job interview**Their formatting varied but the exact wording was used. Are these guys typing from a script? My argument is that in reality, the FBI investigation wasn‚Äôt prevented. It‚Äôs active right now. Are aware there is currently an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh accusations?  Leftists in the media and in the Democrat party lost the election, across the board. They don‚Äôt make that call. Do you agree with that, or believe otherwise? Are you a bot? You and someone else that responded to my above comments made the exact same response, word for word.Or are you guys typing from a script? We know for a fact she lied about a ‚Äúcorroborating‚Äù witness having lived in Washington and being told about the events as they took place. The so called witness had moved from Washington a year before Anita started working for Thomas.So it is a fact she was lying during her testimony. Don‚Äôt let revisionist, leftist media tell you otherwise.  All parties are innocent until proven guilty. Why is that such a foreign concept for you to understand? You can start with corroborating evidence from actual witnesses.  Leftists who push the idea of guilty until proven innocent are a disgrace to this country and its founding philosophy. This is why I believe the left may very well destroy this country one day. I‚Äôm with Lindsey Graham 100%. I hope to god you people never get power.  People who think the Republicans and White House have prevented the FBI from investigating the Kavanaugh accusations, do not live in reality. That‚Äôs simply an observable fact. You do understand the FBI is in fact investigating the accusations because of the White House and Republicans, right? It‚Äôs hilarious but also pretty damn sad because these uncorroborated accusations are not going to stop him from getting confirmed. People on your side are going to have the biggest meltdown once this is over, with many likely yelling to sky about Republicans supporting gang rapes. It‚Äôs also a disgrace how the left has pushed the idea of guilty until proven innocent. You seemingly made the disclaimer that you differ from the left in that regard, but you are in the minority my friend. Didn‚Äôt Trump have like 15 that suddenly came out just a few weeks before his general election before he went on to win? I‚Äôm not limiting it to just two. Don‚Äôt put words in my mouth.I‚Äôm attempting to help you understand why this may be backfiring against Democrats. If you want to be a passive-aggressive about it, don‚Äôt even both responding.  If you ignore the revisionist efforts from leftist establishment media, the Anita Hill accusations were thought to be non-credible by a majority of Americans after the hearings. Of course that‚Äôs not reported by so-called ‚Äújournalists‚Äù today, but many people realized it then just as many realize it now.  Kavanaugh is a much smarter lawyer than any of these leftist journalists you‚Äôre relying on for this story. Once you get specific in regards to what the questions were that he allegedly answered dishonestly asked under oath, it‚Äôll derail all the hype you currently have about stopping his nomination under these grounds. If he heard she was shopping around for witnesses, and asked some of his peers to defend him, that doesn‚Äôt mean he necessarily knew about the specific accusation she was going to come up with; which was that he thrusted his penis into her face at a dorm party. Let‚Äôs say he‚Äôs innocent until proven guilty, a very foreign concept to the left. (At least when it suits them.) This means the accusation is false, and he wouldn‚Äôt have known about what she was specifically accusing him of until he read the New Yorker article.  I can‚Äôt even tell if this is Sarcasm. The Republicans just delayed the vote for a second time, and the White House just ordered the FBI to investigate the Kavanaugh allegations. Yet Republicans and the White House are trying to prevent an investigation into the Kavanaugh allegations?I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs your media sources and just word of mouth, but some of you live in such a different reality than me and others.I cannot imagine how you‚Äôre going to feel or what you‚Äôre going to believe once Kavanaugh gets confirmed. Russian involvement, I mean who really knows? The media has depicted him as a ‚Äúrager‚Äù and womanizer during his high school years.  Hillary might be in the news once a month. Trump lives rent free in these people‚Äôs heads every single day.  >The seat has been empty for over two years; if Kavanaugh is innocent of these claims, how could delaying the confirmation vote for a couple of weeks to carry out an investigation and a hearing matter?The seat has not been empty for over 2 years. Kennedy only retired back in the summer.  Any day now it‚Äôll happen bud.  How about you elaborate as to what you‚Äôre on about? She went from claiming "the incident DID happen, many of us heard about it in school‚Äù to ‚Äúthat it happened or not, I have no idea.‚ÄùWhat is fake newsy about this headline, exactly? Zero indictments from the Mueller probe pertain to Trump-Russian collusion. That is an absolute fact. One you should accept.  Let‚Äôs be honest here. You‚Äôve seen just as I have accusations such as ‚Äúsell out‚Äù or ‚ÄúUncle Tom‚Äù hurled towards conservative-leaning African Americans. This isn‚Äôt some unheard of phenomenon.  Her opting not to testify completely diminishes the credibility on this accusation. The FBI has even already stated they won‚Äôt investigate this. She either testifies as to what happened next week, or Kavanaugh gets his vote.  >What needs to be clarified here for the claim to be credible?This has been explained to you. Go back and read my previous comments if you want. I‚Äôm not holding your hand and typing them again for you.  Safe from vague and unverified allegations of misconduct. What do you not understand about it being so vague, it‚Äôs not even possible for him to disprove it? I‚Äôm skeptical of an allegation that is not only extremely vague and lacking of any corroboration by witnesses, but one that already includes some inconsistencies. The Democrats clearly found the allegation to be dubious too, as they opted against coming forward with this information back in July when they first received it.  Without going into too much detail, I graduated with my BA in Accounting and went into private accounting. Very happy where I‚Äôm at right now.  I got a great job post-graduation, and just bought my first Porsche at 24 years old.  Democrats clearly didn‚Äôt see it as being very credible, since they opted against coming forward with this information back in July when they first received it. Instead, knowing it likely isn‚Äôt credible enough to prevent Kavanaugh‚Äôs confirmation, they waited until the 11th hour to strictly delay the confirmation vote. As I just said, that explanation doesn‚Äôt mean rational people are going to immediately forgo their skepticism. She doesn‚Äôt even remember when and where it took place. It‚Äôs a very shaky and unverified story that details something that allegedly took place 35 years ago. It would be outright irresponsible if we allowed such a thing to derail a SC nomination. No male in the country would be safe from something like this.  Her explanation for the inconsistency is that the therapist wrote down the wrong number, but that still does very little in deterring the skepticism it induces.   There‚Äôs also a critical inconsistency in the therapist notes from the story we‚Äôre being told now. These are all questions that deserve attention, especially with such a damning allegation.  I just purchased my first Porsche last week and I‚Äôm 24 years old. I can identify with many of the reasons mentioned in wanting to make the purchase, but I‚Äôve wanted a sports car since I started driving 8 years ago. While I‚Äôm willing to admit it easily wasn‚Äôt the most financially responsible move to make, I don‚Äôt plan on losing that much in value by the time I sell it in a few years. I also didn‚Äôt buy as new of a car. Mine is a 2009 Porsche Cayman, that I bought for $25,000.  Her explanation for the inconsistency is that the therapist wrote down the wrong number, but that still does very little in deterring the skepticism it induces.   The inconsistency is at least worth mentioning when holding up the notes as evidence. It at a very minimum diminishes the value of the notes as evidence, regardless of her explanation that the therapist made the error.  So far it‚Äôs two people‚Äôs word against hers. Her therapist notes being inconsistent with the story being told now is also a little suspect. >She has no personal interest in defaming Kavanaugh, and everything to lose if her claims are proven falseShe‚Äôs more politically active than the average person, and supportive of the Democratic Party. Democrats are describing Kavanaugh‚Äôs appointment to the court as having life or death ramifications. This SC seat could easily motivate someone to make these allegations.  The therapist notes from 2012 are also inconsistent with the story being told now.  The doctor‚Äôs notes from 2012 being inconsistent with the story being told now may not be the kind of evidence you‚Äôre alluding towards.  I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs intellectually poor to not apply skepticism towards an accusation like this. Even if it‚Äôs towards an individual you consider to be political opposition.  Did she claim it was Kavanaugh or just a some vague person that become prominent in Washington?The answer to this is critical.  What has the alt-right successfully implemented? The previous owner had it done, but I believe around $1,500. Definitely worth it if you get a good enough job.  Yeah, I can see that.  I already have 18‚Äù wheels now. What do you think about 19‚Äùs? It‚Äôs Ceramic coated, did the paint wonders for sure. Preciate‚Äô it!  Right now my top priority is getting 20‚Äù Porsche wheels and new tires. There‚Äôs definitely a little too much clearance up front.  It‚Äôs actually a 2009! It has the BiXenon headlights which really does the front end justice. I‚Äôm in love to say the least.  You did tell him to fact check before making the claim that Obama‚Äôs never hit 3 percent annual growth. Do you understand how you were confused, and ironically were the one that needed to fact check? [This ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/9f9cfm/comment/e5uunuh?st=JM0RSH6M&sh=14d23b62) was the comment that was misinterpreted.A NS above was demanding OP fact check before making claims that Obama never hit 3 percent annual GDP growth. He/she was merely confused and didn‚Äôt understand the comment.  What? That‚Äôs not the comment we‚Äôre referring to. Why are you randomly quoting Trump? If you didn‚Äôt realize those states were referred to as blue states for decades, that‚Äôs your fault for not paying attention. This is not an argument. It‚Äôs merely a fact I‚Äôm trying to explain to you as colorfully as possible.  Statewide elections are most relevant, but Scott Walker‚Äôs victory was a narrow one. Liberals in the state actually protested by trying to block off the capital building after his recall victory.  They were referred to as the ‚Äúblue wall‚Äù by the media. Most of them hadn‚Äôt gone for Republicans since the 1980s.  You‚Äôve still failed to comprehend his comment. Go back and read it again. He didn‚Äôt say Trump had already hit 3% annual GDP growth. He said it was a wait and see, albeit likely this year.  I don‚Äôt believe he has a conservative political bias as much as he is an Originalist - which gets misconstrued as a political bias by leftists/media who prefer legislating from the bench. Ideally we would have a court full of originalists or textualists on the Supreme Court. The court‚Äôs role is to interpret what the Constitution says, not what we would like it to say. If certain laws become outdated and there is a political will to change those laws, there‚Äôs a legislative process to do just that. That‚Äôs the intended process put forth by the Constitution. Kavanaugh and other Originalists represent these principles; and our Constitution and country would be better served to have more of them on the Supreme Court. Ideally we wouldn‚Äôt even be a balance between textualists and judicial activists.  Their endorsement only paints the Democrats/media as partisan actors in regards to Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination. Which anyone paying attention already knows by now. It would reflect poorly on moderate Democrats in Trump states that vote against Kavanaugh. The endorsement could be featured in attack ads to argue their no vote was purely political and not based on Kavanaugh‚Äôs qualifications.  >The alleged victim, Rudy Peters, who is running for the 15th Congressional District of California, told the San Francisco Chronicle a man walked up to his booth at the festival and made a series of "disparaging remarks" about Republicans and some of the party's leadership, including President Donald Trump. >‚ÄùAll of a sudden we hear someone screaming, '(expletive) Trump, (expletive) Trump!'" Peters told the newspaper, adding the man also held up his middle finger. If the parties were reversed, this would be a national news story that be receiving extensive coverage right about now. Since it happened to a Republican, the media couldn‚Äôt give a damn. No mention of it on ABC, CBS, or NBC yesterday evening. They not only don‚Äôt care, some are probably sympathetic to the attacker.  As small as a chance you see him not getting confirmed, it‚Äôs even smaller that the American Bar Association retracts their endorsement over these baseless perjury allegations. Democrats are just flinging anything they can to the wall to keep the base riled up. It‚Äôs all grandstanding and political theater.  Do you really think Kavanaugh isn‚Äôt getting confirmed? Just curious.  I‚Äôm sure they have followed the hearings of the judge they endorsed to some extent. These partisan allegations have just fallen on deaf ears outside of ‚Äúresistance‚Äù circles.  As for job growth, the unemployment rate has dropped so low it only makes logical sense that hiring isn‚Äôt increasing at a growing rate. We are currently at an 18 year low. The key takeaway is that layoffs aren‚Äôt occurring. Trump also inherited a 4.8 percent unemployment rate, and it‚Äôs dropped nearly a full percentage point since his time in office. Economic growth is measured by GDP growth, don‚Äôt know where the confusion came from above. GDP growth is what I wanted to zero in on. As someone stated above, Obama‚Äôs last 6 quarters average to 1.48 percent growth, while Trump‚Äôs first 6 quarters average to 2.7 percent growth. The trajectory as it relates to economic growth in fact did change. [Most economists agree Trump‚Äôs policies have grown the economy. ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/economists-credit-trump-as-tailwind-for-u-s-growth-hiring-and-stocks-1515682893) I‚Äôm open to more comparisons in GDP growth. As you already pointed out, Trump is set to reach 3 percent annual GDP growth his second year in office. Obama never hit it once throughout his 8 years. That‚Äôs even more remarkable when you consider where we are in the current business cycle.  Do you have any evidence the American Bar Association sees these partisan and unfounded allegations as serious and would retract their rating? >I'm not so sure?  More private-sector jobs created in Obama's last 18 months vs. Trump's first 18 months. Full-time wage growth included benefits was very slightly higher in Obama's last 18 months vs. Trump's first 18 months.My argument is that GDP growth under Trump is undisputedly higher than it was under a Obama. It stems from his pro-growth tax policy as well as deregulatory policy. Those are all facts. We can compare averages or raw numbers. I‚Äôm game for whatever. So even though my statement was in regards to GDP growth, I am interested in the data you‚Äôre referring to above. What are you sources for this? The American Bar Association gave Kavanaugh its top rating of ‚ÄúWell Qualified" to serve as a Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.How do you coincide that with what the media is telling you in regards to his qualifications? Don‚Äôt you believe one opinion is more informed/less partisan compared to the other? There is no measure where the economic growth under Obama rivals Trump‚Äôs thus far. That‚Äôs a battle you‚Äôre better off staying away from.  Really would love them on my 987.2. Looks incredible.  If someone wore a shirt depicting multiple minorities as Jim Crow, would you staunchly argue just as you are now that they‚Äôre only referring to some minorities, rather than all? This is a huge blow to the left‚Äôs ambitions of removing Trump from office. We already know Russian collusion isn‚Äôt going to materialize, now perjury is a lost cause too.We can expect the left to only dig its heels in deeper in regards to removing Trump. [Their Banana Republic-like tactics are going to pick up.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/trump-white-house-anonymous-resistance.html)  How can you read past the headline and not have that answered already?> Kaepernick made prior statement with police-as-pigs socks Did you read the article I linked? >In one poll, which was conducted by Reuters, 72 percent of Americans said that they thought Kaepernick's behavior was unpatriotic. Another 61 percent said that they do not "support the stance Colin Kaepernick is taking and his decision not to stand during the national anthem."https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/poll-majority-of-americans-disagree-with-colin-kaepernicks-protest/ https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/49ers/kaepernick-made-prior-statement-police-pigs-socks Clothing is a form of protest, but you are being dishonest by claiming his socks are not depicting police as pigs. I have no intention of wasting my time with dishonest people. Probably the guy that started doing what the mass majority of the country disagrees with.  If you want a legitimate discussion, try to avoid off topic straw men. Ask questions about the topic at hand.  I know he depicted all police officers as pigs because he did so with clothing. If you followed the news better back when he first start sitting during the anthem, you would too.https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2016/9/1/12751038/colin-kaepernick-wore-some-police-pig-socks-49ers-camp It‚Äôs just a condescending conclusion to reach. Obviously him sitting during the anthem isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôm talking about. It takes two seconds to google ‚ÄúKaepernick police officers pigs‚Äù to inform yourself before asking that bad of a question. https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2016/9/1/12751038/colin-kaepernick-wore-some-police-pig-socks-49ers-camp Instead of asking that question, why not just use google first?  Don‚Äôt revise history. He was a 3rd string quarterback by the time he started sitting during the national anthem. I‚Äôll definitely avoid purchasing their products. With Kaepernick now as their spokesperson, they‚Äôve condoned all of his polarizing positions, such as equating all police officers with pigs. I personally hope Nike suffers financially, but so many in this country identify with Kaep‚Äôs messages.  One that didn‚Äôt depict all police officers as pigs, for starters.Many of us won‚Äôt see eye to eye on that, but try to understand where I‚Äôm coming from as someone who grew up with police officers in my family.  It‚Äôs only been extremely polarizing for the country. His intended messaged was drowned out entirely by the ensuing drama.  Originalist.  Of course there are flaws and it‚Äôs important to make changes over time. That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs a legislative process to do just that.  I find it highly amusing that leftists consider Originalist Justices who interpret the Constitution as it is written are somehow limiting freedoms. Do you really believe holding up the Constitution as it is limits our freedoms? He should have known better. Anything remotely resembling racism is going to be blown to extreme portions by the media/left. That‚Äôs the game they play, and an experienced politician has to know this. Granted the comment was in reference to his socialist policies, but that‚Äôs been glossed over entirely.  >‚ÄùLet‚Äôs be clear also about what‚Äôs going on here,‚Äù CNN‚Äôs Jeffrey Toobin said in a panel discussion with Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday evening.>‚ÄùThe theme here is, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm Donald Trump and I‚Äôll protect you from the scary black people.‚Äô Antifa is widely perceived as an African-American organization, and this is just part of the same story of LeBron James and Don Lemon and Maxine Waters and the NFL players and the UCLA basketball players,‚Äù he added.Jeffrey Toobin is a moron. ANTIFA is a black organization? What an ignorant comment. It‚Äôs all basement-dwelling white millennials that look like they‚Äôve tried meth a few times. Of course it goes uncorrected on CNN.  Yeah.

They receive federal emergency Medicaid, along with state-funded social welfare. If they have children here, they can receive federal food stamps such as SNAP.  Puerto Ricans don‚Äôt typically support Republicans though.

The American public has known about his character shortcomings for years, they aren‚Äôt suddenly going to turn against him on the basis that he paid off a porn star to keep their affair from the previous decade quiet.The Manafort stuff has nothing to do with the 2016 election or Trump. We shouldn‚Äôt be surprised it hasn‚Äôt moved the needle in any way.  So as I understand it, the Super Delegates do still exist. The main question I have is will this prevent the national media from tallying the super delegate votes prior to the actual primaries taking place? That‚Äôs the only way this move will have an effect in evening the playing field. As for the Republican Party adopting such a reform, they don‚Äôt have Super Delegates. If it did, Trump probably wouldn‚Äôt be President right now.  Okay, you actually have no clue what I‚Äôm talking about. Nothing wrong with that, and I‚Äôll gladly elaborate on it:>On November 21, 2013, the Senate voted 52‚Äì48, with all Republicans and three Democrats voting against, to rule that "the vote on cloture under Rule XXII for all nominations other than for the Supreme Court of the United States is by majority vote,"[30] even though the text of the rule requires "three-fifths of the senators duly chosen and sworn" to end debate.[31] This ruling's precedent eliminated the 60-vote requirement to end a filibuster against all executive branch nominees and judicial nominees other than to the Supreme Court.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_option >Originalist judges are an enemy of people without means adhering strictly to a document written by slave owners over 200 years ago I don‚Äôt have a problem with anyone disagreeing with parts of the Constitution. That‚Äôs entirely your prerogative, and you‚Äôre certainly entitled to your opinion. The Constitution ironically necessitates it. It‚Äôs just important to understand that there‚Äôs a legislative process in regards to changing what the Constitution says. That‚Äôs the intended process, not the judiciary.  You said it was time for Democrats to catch up with Republicans in regards to changing precedence. I just want you to understand that Democrats took a major step in changing precedence when they changed that rule.  Garland was a leftist judge. I‚Äôll never understand why well intended people wouldn‚Äôt want an Originalist Justice on the Supreme Court. Some are at least forward in that they disagree with parts of the Constitution and see the judiciary as a means of shortcut in regards to changing it. For those that respect our Constitution as it is, we should want Originalists on the court.  Didn‚Äôt Democrats remove the super majority threshold for the confirmation of federal judges? Let‚Äôs not be disingenuous.  As I said elsewhere in this thread: While the questions seem similar, the answers are not. Illegal immigration isn‚Äôt a constitutional right, while ownership of firearms is.  What you‚Äôre failing to understand is it‚Äôs intolerable for us to encounter crime from illegal immigrants on the sole basis that they‚Äôre only here as a result of governmental failure in regards to our immigration system. It‚Äôs not that someone simply being an illegal immigrant makes them commit a murder. It‚Äôs that any murder committed by them should have never been able to occur in the first place.  Yes, I‚Äôm familiar with those two other charges as well. Those are what I believe the prosecution has used to squeeze Cohen in order to get him to flip in regards to the NDA or even Russian collusion. Yeah, no problem.  >Why would any murder have happened *because* the murderer was undocumented? Especially when the murderer and the victim don't even know each other? If not for the failures of our immigration system, the hypothetical illegal immigrant is never given the chance to murder their American victim inside our borders. For example, Mollie Tibbets would be alive if our immigration system prevented Rivera from unlawfully entering the country as it was intended to.  Urban crime rates inflate that number. Also arguing that not all illegal immigrants commit crime after the fact they already break our immigration laws is not a sound justification for future illegal immigration.  >Last I checked, his place of employment also says he was in the US legally. Not saying DHS is wrong, but they _could_ be wrong.This is misinformation. Recent reports have already cleared up this talking point. The man‚Äôs father even gave an interview yesterday where he says the man entered the country illegally about 8 years ago.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/08/23/an-iowa-student-went-missing-now-her-death-is-at-the-center-of-the-immigration-debate/ That‚Äôs only one of his charges. Even if he paid it directly out of pocket, he‚Äôs still charged for an excessive campaign contribution. If the NDA can‚Äôt be proven to have been a campaign contribution, the charges from an unlawful corporate contribution and excessive campaign contribution both become invalid.  >Paying hush money from your campaign funds is legal (probably).  No, you‚Äôre definitely not supposed to do that. The initial defense from the Trump legal team in the beginning was that the NDA did not come from campaign funds. Cohen is getting squeezed and is likely trying to say whatever it takes to get handed lighter sentencing. >You could make the argument that he is making this up, but in doing so, he's making up the one fact that will send him to prisonYou‚Äôre forgetting about his other charges of tax fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. Many are not going to agree with you and Trump‚Äôs harshest critics that because he paid off a porn star to keep an affair from the previous decade quiet, there are now grounds for impeachment. Think about it this way: How many Democrats are calling for impeachment this week? There‚Äôs legal ambiguity if merely paying for a non-disclosure agreement is a campaign contribution. Trump may have paid for this NDA regardless of whether he was campaigning to win an election, which would make it a personal contribution. In regard‚Äôs to John Edwards‚Äôs case, he had actually used funds from his political donors to pay for his NDA. Even then, he walked.  I agree that most aren‚Äôt. This is clearly on the minds of many right now. It‚Äôs why impeachment is being prematurely discussed by Trump critics ‚Äî it‚Äôs the easiest route that completely bypasses this issue.  She gave an interview last week on how traumatic the entire experience has been.  There‚Äôs some legal ambiguity if merely paying for a non-disclosure agreement is a campaign contribution. People like to cite John Edwards‚Äôs case, but he had actually used funds from his political donors to pay for his NDA. Even then, he got off.  Can we at least agree that the goal posts were originally Russian-Trump collusion? Supporters of his have known about his character shortcomings for years, they aren‚Äôt suddenly going to want him removed from office on the basis that he paid off a porn star to keep their affair from the previous decade quiet.Just trying to give you some perspective. This widespread talk of impeachment among his critics is way too premature.  You‚Äôre forgetting that a specific candidate has to actually defeat Trump. It‚Äôs not like he just loses on the basis of his own shortcomings alone. Democrats have to put up not only a good candidate, but one that has appeal outside of the coasts and throughout Middle America.  His average approval is sitting at 43.5% on RCP right now. >Maybe if we treated illegals better, Mollie would still be alive? > He lived and worked here for 4 to 7 with no record, but all of a sudden he kills her *because* he's an illegal? If you think he killed her because we treat illegal immigrants badly, why are you rhetorically asking if he killed her because of his status as an illegal immigrant? At least get your logic in order. My position is clear. If our immigration system wasn‚Äôt broken and he never unlawfully entered the country, Mollie Tibbets would be alive.  I specifically said that in regards to this instance. That PAC ad came out a while back. Now I know it‚Äôs been said before, and it‚Äôs not helpful or productive. That‚Äôs why I said I wish we all could reframe from using that sort of rhetoric. This thread isn‚Äôt about gun control; but while the questions are similar, the answers are not. Illegal immigration is not a constitutional right, while ownership of firearms is.  Many parents of victims killed by illegal immigrants take part in activism, too. Some parents of the Parkland shooting victims also argued the solution wasn‚Äôt more gun control. In the specific case of Mollie Tibbetts, we haven‚Äôt heard her parents‚Äô input yet. CNN only ran an article on Mollie‚Äôs apparent aunt and a distant cousin.  This is mostly the type of issue that keeps Trump‚Äôs supporters throughout Middle America and key swing states engaged and ready to vote.  The argument that her murder isn‚Äôt indicative of the failures of our immigration laws is the equivalent to a career criminal with prior murder convictions being released on parole only to quickly commit murder again; and people proclaiming it has nothing to do with the failures of the criminal justice system. Of course this has everything to do with the failures of our immigration system. If it weren‚Äôt for these failures, Mollie Tibbetts would be alive. On a side note, I want to point out a significant contrast in that the right‚Äôs general response has not been ‚Äúthe Democrats have blood on their hands!‚Äù Obviously that kind of rhetoric is never productive or helpful in any meaningful capacity. In the immediate aftermath of mass shootings, we routinely hear from prominent figures on the American left and mainstream media that the NRA has either blood on their hands or is a terrorist organization. This is widespread. As far as I know, no member of the NRA has ever carried out a mass shooting. I really just wish we could all reframe from this type of rhetoric.  ‚ÄúThis has nothing to do with illegal immigration!‚ÄùThis logic is just like a career criminal with prior murder convictions being released on parole only to commit murder and liberals proclaiming it has nothing to do with the failures of our criminal justice system. Of course this has everything to do with the failures of our immigration system. These are things only idiots or liars can say at this point  For those that haven‚Äôt seen it, her social media paints her as anti-Trump and pretty far-left on the political spectrum. It‚Äôs crazy to think that the Democrat party she supported so much will now try to make her memory fade as quickly as possible.  Various mainstream media reports are still describing his legal status as disputed, implying the USCIS could be lying when they say there‚Äôe no record of him in their system. There is no low the media isn‚Äôt willing to sink to when it comes to protecting the narrative.  I definitely agree the Democrats answering that they‚Äôre socialists are uniformed. They understood the question, they just don‚Äôt know what socialism even is.  Socialist policies ‚â† socialist economy. The United States operates under private ownership of industry. Profit motive drives the economy. This poll is clear in that it asks a binary choice between capitalism and socialism.  Manafort should get pardoned towards the end of Trump‚Äôs Presidency, for sure after the Russia investigation wraps up.  The truth right here.  A college education is an investment. You can‚Äôt expect to benefit from one without sacrificing your own capital of some form or another. We should honestly only chalk up support for socialism over capitalism to ignorance or misinformation. Countries that have legitimately ditched capitalism in favor of socialism are the ones where [the average citizen lost an average of 24 pounds last year. ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-food/venezuelans-report-big-weight-losses-in-2017-as-hunger-hits-idUSKCN1G52HA)  Not their voters, at least. According to polling data, registered Democrats now view socialism more favorably than capitalism. https://news.gallup.com/poll/240725/democrats-positive-socialism-capitalism.aspx You‚Äôre going to have some major disappointment coming your way. Hopefully you have it in you to go about it the right way.  Honestly, it‚Äôs hateful people like you ordering others how to vote that brought us here in the first place. Hope you‚Äôve enjoyed the first year and a half you little leftist.  Manafort getting off would be a first major blow to the Mueller probe. Even though it doesn‚Äôt pertain to actions taken in the 2016 election, it would put a lot of credibility towards the witch hunt narrative.Mainstream media outlets are threatening to go public with the jurors‚Äô names and home addresses. This could hold them firm towards conviction. Time will tell.  I absolutely agree the scale of threats would be tenfold in the event they acquit, but risks still exist in both scenarios.  Yup. Regardless of which direction the jury goes, they could be targeted.  >Still, the importance of even a slight shift in African-American voter sentiment shouldn't be underestimated. They make up greater than 10% of the US electorate, and more in key swing states like Florida, Michigan and Virginia.>If you were to apply the changes we see in Trump's approval rating among blacks compared with his vote share in 2016 and all other groups voted the same, it would mean a shift in the national margin of about 1 percentage point toward him. In these swing states mentioned, it could be even greater.I‚Äôd argue this increase in support stems from our economic gains since Trump‚Äôs election. It‚Äòs going to be extremely advantageous for Trump and other Republicans to continuously hammer home the ‚Äúlowest African-American unemployment rate in history‚Äù statistical point. Especially since no one else will.  Very interesting. My main thought is how prevalent this mentality might be among the left. Odds are it‚Äôs decently high.  Gotcha. I have just one more question. Have there been any indictments against former-Trump officials that pertain to illegal dealings with the Russians? So Trump and the GOP are all traitors to their country. What about the people who voted for them? Thanks for reminding how poor of a news source Vox is. I skimmed through the article, and what they declared as evidence of collusion amounted to contacts with Russians. I believe they also threw in Trump‚Äôs presser where he sarcastically asked the Russians to hack Hillary‚Äôs private sever that had been inoperable for 4 years at that point. I‚Äôd say the likes of Vox and their hopeful readers are in for a major letdown.  Are you sure it‚Äôs not because ‚Äòthere‚Äôs substantiated evidence the President is a traitor‚Äô is bullshit? What are you going to do if Trump is cleared by Mueller‚Äôs investigation? If that were true, wouldn‚Äôt Democrats be actively campaigning on impeaching a President that was a verified traitor?Why do you think there‚Äôs a disconnect there, and they aren‚Äôt talking about impeachment? Where is the evidence that Trump is a traitor then? For those unaware, the jury sent a letter to the judge asking the meaning of beyond a reasonable doubt. Apparently this is a strong sign Manafort might be getting off. There would be major implications if that were to happen. Doxxing threats from CNN are nothing new, but this suit includes essentially all left-wing media: New York Times, Washington Post, Buzzfeed, NBC, etc. Can you explain how it‚Äôs true?  The fact that you can‚Äôt understand these relatively-basic current events says a lot. That on top of your childish insults.  If I lie to federal investigators in saying I didn‚Äôt wake up at 7 a.m. this morning, it doesn‚Äôt mean that waking up at 7 a.m. was an illegal act. Lying to federal investigators is. Most cases it‚Äôs just the opposition to the living breathing document argument. How so? You bet. See my comment [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/981r8q/comment/e4cy3zx?st=JKYGGEB1&sh=6c7d42c3)  That‚Äôs not an illegal dealing with the Russians. Lying to federal investigators was illegal. Understand the difference? This is a strong point. Although many laughed at the thought, he always persisted he was the one Republican that could win the electoral college. This was one of his go-to selling points.  An even better example was Justice Souter. Appointed by H.W. Bush and originally thought to be an originalist, he eventually came to vote reliably with the liberal side of the court. He went on to retire under President Obama.  Okay? Can you name a single indictment that pertains to? I‚Äôm interested in factual discussion. That‚Äôs where we aren‚Äôt seeing eye to eye. Just because you want there to be a Russia-related indictment against former-Trump campaign officials, doesn‚Äôt mean my statement pointing out there haven‚Äôt been any yet is disingenuous or misleading.  That‚Äôs not an illegal act with Russia. If I lie to federal investigators in saying I didn‚Äôt wake up at 7 a.m. this morning, it doesn‚Äôt mean that waking up at 7 a.m. was an illegal act. Lying to federal investigators is. Is that clear enough for you? >no former-Trump campaign officials have pled guilty for illegal acts with Russia.Which part of this statement is false?  You are going full Orwell on this. Why even choose this hill to die on? Well, your opinion is obviously a biased one. Others might argue getting your clearance revoked harms your credibility. >In my opinion, Brennan has earned the right to complain, whether you like it or not. More strawmen? You can‚Äôt help yourself. Where have I argued Brennan doesn‚Äôt have the right to complain?  >And yes, you are being somewhat disingenuous, or else you are genuinely misinformed or deliberately not telling the truth.I‚Äôm misinformed for making the objective statement that no former-Trump campaign officials have pled guilty for illegal acts with Russia? So objective facts are now misinformation. What other Orwellian sentiments do you have for me?  I‚Äôm not mixing up a thing. There have been zero indictments against former-Trump campaign officials on illegal dealings with Russia. That is an objective fact, whether you like it or not.  I‚Äôm the one being disingenuous? He just said this:>So far a lot of people close to Trump have pled guilty and admitted to having illegal dealings with the Russians This is objectively false. The indictments aren‚Äôt ambiguous. We know exactly what they are for, and it‚Äôs not illegal acts with Russia. Stop propagating this claim.  No one from the Trump campaign has pled guilty to illegal dealings with Russia. Rick Gates‚Äò conspiracy charge is money laundering from his time lobbying for the Ukraine. So why are you lying? Polling shows so many Democrats believe what you are trying to push. Were you genuinely misinformed on this, or deliberately not telling the truth? I‚Äôm not arguing he was still receiving classified information. You‚Äôve decided to attack a strawman rather the crux of my argument.You think he still has the same credibility now that he has been stripped of his security clearance? Answer that honestly.  >So far a lot of people close to Trump have pled guilty and admitted to having illegal dealings with the Russians Can you elaborate on this? It is false, but I‚Äôm curious how you rationalize this statement. Oh yeah the downvotes here are radical. I can lose hundreds of karma points within just 2 to 3 comments. It‚Äôs honestly a lot worse than r/politics.  The fact that your comment is so heavily downvoted gets me bummed. Really wish both sides could at least agree America isn‚Äôt a bad country.  It shouldn‚Äôt be this hard to figure out. The media was capitalizing on Brennan‚Äôs access and the credibility that comes with it when they had him on to accuse the President of illegal acts. Brennan got paid by every network he made these accusations on.  It‚Äôs only because they hold anyone that opposes Trump with the upmost respect. It‚Äôs a means to an end. [Take a look at this article about Omarosa.](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/glanton/ct-met-omarosa-black-card-dahleen-glanton-20180815-story.html) The left is now cherishing her as a black woman all of sudden. Solely because they can use her for political gain against Trump. Does the Trump Administration get fined for violating Brennan‚Äôs free speech rights, or do they have to reinstate his security clearance?  I‚Äôve only seen Clapper, who‚Äôs not exactly a legal analyst. Still, how can someone that has worked in government their entire life not even know what the First Amendment is? I lean libertarian, so your efforts of painting me as authoritarian are pretty damn humorous. Could you not find any legal analysts that share your argument? Not even a CNN legal analyst? That is nonsense. As I said, more hysterical language like this only serves to stifle bipartisan discussion. Can you cite any credible legal analyst that has made this argument? Do you think Brennan will sue, citing First Amendment violations? Do you honestly think the First Amendment protects CIA agents from having their security clearance revoked? Think that through before you respond.  Are you able to cite which law was broken by revoking Brennan of his clearance? If not, I completely understand.  We will just have to agree to disagree that making unsubstantiated claims that the President of the United States is a traitor isn‚Äôt partisan.  Revoking Brennan‚Äôs security clearance is illegal dictator-like nonsense? It‚Äôs hysterical language like yours that stifles political discussion. How do you expect anyone that doesn‚Äôt already agree with you to take you seriously? What you have to understand is officials of his position were historically seen as nonpartisan, which is why they kept clearances after leaving their posts.It‚Äôs unprecedented for these former top officials to throw claims such as treason against their White House successor. It‚Äôs a major problem, and we‚Äôre going to start seeing more clearances get revoked if this partisan behavior becomes the norm.  People of his position were historically seen as nonpartisan, which is why they kept clearances after leaving their posts.It‚Äôs unprecedented for these former top officials to throw claims like treason against their White House successor. It‚Äôs a major problem, and you‚Äôre going to start seeing more clearances get revoked if this continues.  Well, what you think obviously isn‚Äôt going to give Brennan his clearance back. >1st amendment, amigo. Unless his speech constitutes a clear and present threat of violence, it's fair game. There's nothing illegal about being provocative.Do you think the First Amendment protects your right to a security clearance? No one is making the argument that Brennan should be in jail for his treason comments.  He‚Äôs a security risk when he goes on national television and makes the unsubstantiated claim that the President is a traitor. That sort of extreme language is not only irresponsible, but dangerous. He‚Äôs using his access and the credibility that comes along with it to embolden these baseless claims. He absolutely should be disqualified from having a clearance.  Brennan using his access and the credibility that comes along it to attack the current Administration is the heart of the problem. Your comment alludes that you‚Äôve even fallen for his shtick. You also don‚Äôt think a high-ranking former Obama official making the unsubstantiated claim that the President of the United States is an outright traitor is any sort of security risk? That‚Äôs the kind of language that could easily incite some crazy person to take action against the President.  >I also don‚Äôt like the slippery slope that Trump can do this to everyone who has been critical of him, as some reports say. Brennan had been using his former position as a source of credibility while going on national television to claim the President is guilty of treason. To argue he was just being critical of the President is disingenuous.  >Having political affiliations doesn't disqualify you from having a clearanceYou‚Äôre putting words in my mouth. I said making unsubstantiated claims that the President is a traitor disqualifies you from having a security clearance.  Because he was such a high-ranking Obama official, you believe it must be substantiated?This is why he just lost his security clearance. That is your preconceived conclusion. If Mueller was in any immediate danger of getting fired, it would have happened by now.  You don‚Äôt think a high-ranking former Obama official making the unsubstantiated claim that the President of the United States is an outright traitor is any sort of national security risk? That‚Äôs the kind of language that could easily incite some crazy person to take action against the President.  Wait until the special counsel finishes its investigation. Do you not see how making that unsubstantiated claim about the President on national television is dangerous?  Brennan had been using his former position as a source of credibility while making the rounds on cable news outlets to claim the President is guilty of treason ‚Äî a crime punishable by the death penalty. To argue there‚Äôs nothing inappropriate about that behavior is disingenuous at best.  Trump‚Äôs average GDP growth thus far engulf‚Äôs Obama‚Äôs average of 1.5 percent growth:>Including the latest Commerce Department figure, the average GDP growth rate during his tenure was about 1.5%. The only president with a worse economic record since 1930 is Herbert Hoover.https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/obamas-final-economic-record-not-greatThe economy usually booms after a recession. This is what‚Äôs called the business cycle. [Obama claimed that 4 years into his Presidency, we would be seeing 4.6 percent annual GDP growth. ](https://www.weeklystandard.com/average-gdp-growth-less-than-half-of-what-obama-predicted/article/657832) He never even hit 3 percent annual GDP growth. The lack of an economic boom after the last recession is indicative of Obama‚Äôs failure on the economy.  Brennan had been using his former position as a source of credibility while making the rounds on cable news outlets to claim the President is guilty of treason ‚Äî a crime punishable by the death penalty. I honestly wouldn‚Äôt want him any where near a security clearance if I were the President.  First Amendment doesn‚Äôt protect your right to a security clearance.  Retaliate as in jail them? Strong click bait.  He‚Äôs the President of the United States. He actually needs a security clearance. John Brennan is out of government. He doesn‚Äôt need his. There are different bars for what constituents getting your clearance revoked. John Brennan‚Äôs is much lower than the POTUS.  If once Trump leaves office he calls the Democrat President a traitor, I would support him losing his security clearance. Which you guys lost first time around. Good luck with the second.  Who‚Äôs going to revoke the President‚Äôs clearance? If after he leaves office he‚Äôs calling the Democrat President a traitor, I‚Äôm sure he gets his security clearance revoked as well.  Maybe he didn‚Äôt know what the word meant? He‚Äôs been going around on tv saying the President was guilty of treason, which is punishable by the death penalty. I believe such a fringe stance strips him of his ability to properly handle a security clearance.  We never ‚Äúboomed‚Äù after the Great Recession. Obama only averaged 1.5% GDP growth throughout his Presidency. That‚Äôs not a boom.  .2 percent? I think OP is reaching pretty hard to imply that‚Äôs indicative of failure. The tax cuts also went into effect in January, so data from a full year doesn‚Äôt reflect purely on its effects.  Yes.  So were you not able to find a reputable news source arguing Trump tweeted that he fired Strzok?People don‚Äôt subject drop 2 to 3 subjects all in the same sentence. It just doesn‚Äôt happen. One is acceptable per sentence. No more than that.  I had hoped for your sake you were trolling, and decided to roll with it too to see how far you‚Äôd go. You really can never tell with liberals. They can‚Äôt stand to concede an inch in a debate. Even if they know they are wrong, as you did, they can‚Äôt say it. Not to say this doesn‚Äôt apply to both sides, I just believe liberals are much worse.  Difference being I can concede when Trump says something false. You people can‚Äôt do it, even with the Washington Post warning you not to die on the AOC hill.  Here‚Äôs the quote to clear up any confusion:>>‚ÄùThe reason that the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act is because they ruled that each of these monthly payments that everyday American make is a taxI believe the Washington Post summed up her statement perfectly:>This appears to be an example of not understanding policy nuances. Subject-verb agreement is relevant. ‚ÄúStrzok‚Äù and ‚Äúwas‚Äù being the sole subject subject-verb agreement means you can‚Äôt end the sentence after ‚ÄúJust fired agent Strzok.‚Äù You have to include the predicate of ‚Äúwas in charge of the crooked Hillary investigation.‚ÄùShow me one reputable left-wing source that makes the argument that Trump tweeted he fired Strzok. Until that happens, your and his argument are on the absolute fringe.  ‚ÄúWe just need more immigration‚Äù - Democrats, probably.  That‚Äôs a poor attempt to shift the subject. My question wasn‚Äôt inquiring Trump‚Äôs grasp of the English language, it was inquiring u/TRUMPISYOURGOD‚Äôs. >‚ÄùJust fired Agent Strzok, formerly of the FBI, was in charge of the crooked Hillary investigation.‚ÄùYou honestly read that as him saying he just fired Strzok? Are you at all familiar with subject-verb agreement? Not enough in the slightest. There are rumors his firing was so delayed because of new information revealed in Lisa Page‚Äôs closed door testimony last month.  Yup. Their partisanship is too overbearing. If the shoe was on the other foot, conservatives would at least be admitting there were sketchy intentions going on and mistakes were made. Liberals just can‚Äôt do that.  The left is losing its mind over his firing. It drastically undermines their narrative on the Russia investigation. This aspect of the story is going into the history books, and they absolutely despise that.  I‚Äôm sure the media and DNC are conspiring as we speak to push a Trump scandal in response to this shift.  That was a leftist troll. Pretty obvious one at that.  ‚ÄúTent City‚Äù as it was called actually doesn‚Äôt even exist anymore, but the bigger point I want you to understand is that it wasn‚Äôt a concentration camp.A concentration camp is where people are imprisoned without charges and therefore no trial. A jail in the United States is inherently not a concentration camp, because we do not jail people without first charging them with a crime. Misusing the term ‚Äúconcentration camp‚Äù is extremely effective for propaganda purposes and ‚Äúriling up the base.‚Äù This particular tactic is why so few even understand what a concentration camp is. The only time the United States has utilized a legitimate concentration camp was during WWII, when FDR interned all Japanese-Americans without charges or a trial.  Are you aware that video is from 2012? While his remark was extremely ill-founded, it also does not pertain to current events.  Okay, let‚Äôs pretend private businesses collect taxes for the sake of your argument. Did the Supreme Court specifically rule that monthly premiums were a tax?Either they did as she specifically said, or they didn‚Äôt. Facts aren‚Äôt fluid.  Do you know what taxation means? It‚Äôs a mandatory financial charge by a governmental entity.For your interpretation to be valid, insurance companies that collect the monthly premiums would have to be government organizations.Do you believe private insurance companies are government organizations?  No, it‚Äôs not technically right. What was ruled a tax was the penalty for not having insurance, not monthly premiums paid to insurers. Her statement is objectively false, and something I would expect to see from someone on Reddit rather than a Congressional candidate. How do you interpret it to be technically correct?(it‚Äôs not) So he is your President now?  So you‚Äôre just pulling it entirely from your ass because you have no evidence of it, is what you‚Äôre saying.  Have you actually seen all the batshit crazy things she‚Äôs been saying lately? Even the Washington Post is firing off warning signs to the left to cool it with her:https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/08/10/fact-checking-alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-media-blitz/?utm_term=.78fef196e889One of my favorites:>‚ÄùThe reason that the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act is because they ruled that each of these monthly payments that everyday American make is a tax. And so, while it may not seem like we pay that tax on April 15th, we pay it every single month or we do pay at tax season if we don‚Äôt buy, you know, these plans off of the exchange.‚Äù ‚Äî interview on CNN‚Äôs ‚ÄúCuomo Prime Time,‚Äù Aug. 8 You don‚Äôt know what a red herring is.  What?I said liberals outnumber Trump supporters 4 to 1 on that sub; and that you‚Äôre full of shit for claiming that‚Äôs the same thing as the_donald. Understand? Great counterpoint. Really showing that deep intellectual rhetoric for which leftists are known.  That‚Äôs very ignorant of what r/asktrumpsupporters is. Liberals outnumber Trump supporters there 4 to 1. The majority of the mod team is liberal. Does that sound like the_donald to you, or are you willing to admit you‚Äôre full of shit? >Literally the people that run these camps have been recorded as calling them "concentration camps"...No, they literally have not. You *literally* made that up in your head.Just like the user above saying I post in the_donald, why do you people insist on making shit up out of thin air?*Edit* - Yet this community is still upvoting your misinforming comment, likely out of partisan spite. This community is anti-intellectual.  Yeah, Trump supporters should really be taking notes from the left‚Äôs new rising star Alexandria Cortez. She certainly exemplifies the intellectualism of the modern left.  This is the epitome of leftist idiocy. We do not have concentration camps. You only yearn for them because your shit ideology is based in intersectionality. Go outside. See for yourself how far from reality your perspective of this country is. Edit: I post in the_donald? You made that up. Show me one comment I‚Äôve ever made there you little leftist.  Haven‚Äôt ever thought about this, but it does ring true. Leftist ideology is based in intersectionality, and who can take the claim to most oppressed and marginalized within a society. While white leftists will generally preach about white privilege and their structured advantage, they instinctively want to stoke the grievances of victimhood themselves, just as the notable sitting at the very top of the intersectional ladder.  Do you actually believe this absolute garbage you‚Äôre saying? Or just typing the first idiotic thing that comes to mind? >Nearly 56% of the U.S. voting-age population cast ballots in the 2016 presidential election, representing a slight uptick compared with 2012 but less than in the record year of 2008.http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/21/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/I do remember seeing a few CNN articles claiming turnout dropped in the 2016 election, which is probably why so many around Reddit say it did.  I‚Äôve always seen conflicting information on turnout. Where have you seen that turnout actually decreased? The only problem with that is sexual orientation was omitted from Title 2 of the civil rights act.  Federal tax revenue is up from last year, but spending increases compared to last year simply outpace it. This is where our deficit increase comes from. >Receipts totaled $2,539 billion during the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, CBO estimates‚Äî$31 billion more than the amount received during the same period last year.https://www.cbo.gov/system/files?file=2018-07/54126-MBR.pdf In what fantasy land has things gone in the left‚Äôs favor in the past few years? Be realistic. The ratio is horrible for you.  >Guess we will eventually find out if you‚Äôre wrong or right, right? Through these past fews years, the left has a poor track record on being right. I mean, you all have been wrong on pretty much everything up to this point. This will be another one of those.  >Wouldn't that depend on who is suspending them? Listen, we don‚Äôt live under your communist paradise. Trump doesn‚Äôt have the necessary centralized control over the economy to suspend NFL players. Only the NFL and its teams can suspend players. Why do I have to explain this? Trump can say he thinks the NFL should suspend players that kneel during the anthem. It‚Äôs within his free speech protections to do so. What do you want the government to do to Trump for expressing this viewpoint? Whatever it is, it won‚Äôt ever happen because this is within Trump‚Äôs rights. Still, do tell.  No conservative is arguing for the government to force these private tech companies to hold a platform for conservative media. This is a contrast from the uninformed liberals that believe a private organization firing you for your speech violates 1st Amendment protections. There were some in this very thread, as a matter of fact.  Show me any legal scholar that makes this ridiculous argument. There isn‚Äôt one, because they would get laughed out of their profession.  Hell no, because it‚Äôs idiotic. Trump didn‚Äôt lose his free speech rights when he became President. He can freely advocate for the NFL to adjust its policies towards players. I don‚Äôt condone him doing so but arguing it‚Äôs illegal for him to is extremely erroneous.  Do you even know what the 1st Amendment is though? It‚Äôs probably something you should brush up on before entering political discussions.Players being suspended for kneeling during the National Anthem would not violate their 1st Amendment rights. Suggesting otherwise only serves to embarrass yourself.  Couldn‚Äôt agree more. This kind of hysteria is exactly what got Trump victories throughout the GOP primaries, arguably the general as well.  Have you actually seen the things she‚Äôs been saying lately? Even the Washington Post is now firing off warning signs to the left to cool it with her:https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/08/10/fact-checking-alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-media-blitz/?utm_term=.78fef196e889 It‚Äôs amazing how much mainstream media outlets respect Antifa. Some articles I‚Äôve read don‚Äôt even mention them by name, honoring their demand of anonymity. Some also want you to think the only ones with weapons were with the Patriot Prayer, like this [ABC article.](https://abcnews.go.com/US/protesters-clash-police-dueling-rallies-held-portland-arrested/story?id=57039893) From my understanding the few that got arrested were with Antifa and it was for clashing with the cops, but no mainstream outlet has clarified this. Pretty crazy all in all. The media has elections to win, so they aren‚Äôt playing any games when it comes to painting the left as saints and the right as violent.  >The way democrats work is *country over party*, not *party over country* Is that why they strive to import unlawful migrants against our country‚Äôs interests, for the sake of their future voting block? To turn Texas blue and all that? All for country over party? Get this Orwellian shit out of here.  Post this somewhere that conservatives aren‚Äôt outnumbered 100 to 1. You‚Äôd get your ass laughed out of the forum. It compares 8 years of GOP united Gov. to I believe 36 years of Unified Dem. government. Which means it includes our years in WWII, where we were pushing ~18 percent annual GDP growth from our industry being nationalized in order to push out war equipment.  Clearly projecting your own shortcomings in life and with friends there guy. I couldn‚Äôt be more proud of the money I make, friends I have, and the car I drive.  Individual Senators still have loyalty to their national party, and their party leaders usually cater to national interests. National polling showing the majority of Americans opposing shutting down the government over DACA came out the day before Democrats caved on the issue. It was relevant. >The democrats from trump states joined the GOP because that‚Äôs what their constituents wantedI‚Äôve already said this was part of it. Just stick to a consistent argument. I get pretty sick of you all attacking from every possible angle, contradicting each other or using a point I‚Äôve already made. Don‚Äôt reply to my comments if that‚Äôs what you intend to do.  Good ones for sure.  There‚Äôs an entire thread of examples. ... You actually believe it‚Äôs possible a majority of Americans supported shutting down their own federal government for the sake of illegal immigrants? Dude, this is supposed to be a serious discussion. Get real. The majority of Democrats polled did, yeah. Not Americans, though.  This NYC district is 50 percent Hispanic. She wins by a landslide even if she doesn‚Äôt show up for a debate.  As I said, national polling showed the majority of Americans did not support shutting down the federal government over DACA. If you followed reports at the time, moderate Democrats from Trump states were behind joining the GOP in ending the filibuster and reopening the Gov. Reports claimed Schumer simply couldn‚Äôt get them to go through with it, hence the shutdown lasting only 2 days. Here‚Äôs a list of the Democrats: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/21/us/politics/bipartisan-senators-government-shutdown.html I basically prioritize high GDP growth, individual rights, and secure borders more. You have to take the good with the bad with Trump, just as plenty of you did with Hillary.  It‚Äôs great that he hits back at the media and Democrats. Republicans have wanted this in a candidate basically all millennium. Trump arguably would not be President of the United States right now if he weren‚Äôt so willing to throw bombs at those two specific groups above. I‚Äôve always opposed it when he chooses to attack private citizens, though. It never helps to punch down at people that genuinely pose no threat politically. I was close to no longer supporting him after the DNC convention where he attacked that gold star family. It was such a politically dumb move and an obvious set up by Democrats.  Him not being able to resist that really turned me and many others off from his candidacy. *Edit* - I lost 150 karma for two comments on this post. Definitely did not say anything rude, just trying to give well-thought out and genuine answers. To all that mindlessly downvote in this sub, I‚Äôm sure your lives probably suck because politics is all you think about; but downvoting supporters in this sub will not make anything better.  If you remember what happened, a chunk Democrats caved and voted for the Spending Bill right as the weekend ended against Chuck Schumer‚Äôs wishes. So this shutdown was only for a couple days. The Democrat Senators that Schumer couldn‚Äôt keep opposed to the spending bill were the ones from more moderate states whose constituents were not willing to shut down the federal government over DACA recipients. As a matter of fact, national polling showed a majority of Americans were not game for it over DACA. Hence why the shutdown only lasted a couple of days.  Nah, he gets the label ‚Äúalternative fact‚Äù instead.  Jumping the gun and publishing a story before properly verifying its accuracy doesn‚Äôt void anyone from the label of fake news.  That wouldn‚Äôt have made sense, but it‚Äôs late and mistakes happen. Don‚Äôt worry about it NS.  >Was there an article about this specific ex-girlfriend that said she was mistreated? Yeah, it‚Äôs the article he linked.  I know some prominent Democrats were spreading the claim too, but this was a long time ago so dated articles are gonna be difficult to find using the relevant keywords.*Edit* - Just look at polling around that time about TCJA. A solid portion of Americans believed it would raise taxes on the middle class. This misbelief stemmed from misleading media and Democrats.  Good find. Will never forget seeing the NYT journalists in question on CNN that morning getting soft-balls as to why they took her out of context.  >We‚Äôre a month removed from a [mass shooting at an American newspaper] (https://www-m.cnn.com/2018/07/03/us/annapolis-capital-gazette-shooter-letter/index.html?r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&rm=) This reminded me, there was fake news surrounding this shooter as well: http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/06/30/reporter-resigns-after-false-tweet-that-maryland-shooting-suspect-had-maga-hat.html What always dumbfounded me were the headlines claiming the tax cuts actually rose taxes on the middle class. So many less-informed people believed that, just from the raw reach of those misleading headlines.  One major misleading narrative that I will never forget was the one pushed during the January Gov. shutdown. The media narrative was that since Republicans had majorities in Congress, they were to blame for the shutdown. This contradicted Democrats utilizing the filibuster to kill the spending bill in the Senate. One CNN journalist was confronted about the filibuster while pushing this particular narrative, can‚Äôt remember his name but he is presented as an actual journalist on the network. His response was that it wasn‚Äôt relevant because plenty of Americans don‚Äôt understand what a filibuster even is. Dude, you‚Äôre a fucking journalist. It‚Äôs your job to inform the public of this stuff, not brag about their ignorance of it on national television.  >Firstly, the regulatory reform has not made any actual impact as of yet, like I said, and will continue not to do so in the short term. Secondly, the article you quoted said, Economists polled in the WSJ survey agreed that deregulatory policy had already made an impact. I cited this above. Feel free to cite some economists saying otherwise. Mindlessly repeating this does not make it true. >Nowhere in this article does it say anything about how a boost is already occurring and has been occurringCan you read? It clearly does:> Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal say President Donald Trump **has had** generally positive effects on U.S. economic growth, hiring and the performance of the stock market during his first year in office.This was before the tax cuts took effect, so most of this was in reference to his deregulatory policy. Still, 90 percent of the economists said the tax cuts would boost GDP growth in the next two years. This means, your laughable argument is opposed by roughly 90 percent of economists.  Here‚Äôs what economists say, from a survey done back in January that polled 68 economists:>A majority said the president had been "somewhat" or "strongly" positive for job creation, gross domestic product growth and the rising stock market.>The pros cite the White House's push for lighter regulation and the recent tax bill as critical to a pro-growth environment; more than 90 percent of the group thought the tax bill would boost GDP expansion over the next two years.https://www.wsj.com/articles/economists-credit-trump-as-tailwind-for-u-s-growth-hiring-and-stocks-1515682893At the time of this survey, economists were already saying his deregulatory policies were responsible for economic boosts. Over 90 percent of the economists said the tax bill would boost GDP over the next couple years, because that‚Äôs what expansionary fiscal policy does. Honestly, I‚Äôm pretty dumbfounded by this. I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve ever taken a college-level economics course, but this stuff is extremely basic.  ... How do you not know of any major fiscal policy changes that have taken place under the Trump Administration? Do you know what fiscal policy is? His agenda has consisted of massive overhauls to both fiscal and regulatory policy. The majority of economists say his policies have been a net positive on economic growth. The angle you‚Äôve decided to take on this is absolutely laughable.  I‚Äôm willing to bet I‚Äôm well above your understanding of this issue honestly. You think fiscal and regulatory policy have very little impact on the economy? That is embarrassingly wrong.  Trump has thus far averaged over 3 percent growth throughout his time in office. Obama never hit 3 percent annual growth once during his 2 terms as President.  >Democrats were left to grumble about the rich benefiting most, and the mainstream press pointed to farmers hurrying silos of soybeans to China ahead of looming tariffs. But others recognized the seriousness of 4.1 percent growth. The Twitter feeds of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), and potential presidential candidates like Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), were silent on the numbers ‚Äî apparently operating under the theory that if you don‚Äôt have something mean to say, don‚Äôt say anything at all.It‚Äôs really going to be difficult for the media/Democrats to paint the economy as a negative. Polling data also showing the economy as the top priory among voters is horrible for the Democrats and their messaging. So long as Trump keeps the focus on the economy, we are in good shape.  Where does Clapper claim there was collusion? That‚Äôs what you were supposed to link.  So the poll is fake news right? >The National Border Patrol Council has high hopes for President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs border security policies. >The union's president, Brandon Judd, has been advising the Trump transition team. The union, which represents Border Patrol agents and endorsed Trump for president in March, has encouraged the building of a border wall and the changing of enforcement policies put in place in the last four years.http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-san-diego-border-patrol-wall-20161118-story.html>The NBPC‚Äôs survey, of more than 600 agents in two of the Border Patrol‚Äôs busiest sectors, found just the opposite: A stunning 89 percent of line agents say a ‚Äúwall system in strategic locations is necessary to securing the border.‚Äù Just 7 percent disagreed.https://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/apr/2/border-patrol-agents-back-trump-wall-survey-finds/ Can you link it?  Ok, what ‚Äúexpert‚Äù has claimed there was collusion? I really couldn‚Äôt care what you believe. lol  When he said he thinks we should have openborders.  He literally asked for a source showing most of border patrol advocating for the wall. I provided said source.  Along the lines of ‚ÄúI would not miss the opportunity to shoot you.‚Äù  lol. So James Clapper claimed there was collusion? Pretty bold claim if true, but I doubt you‚Äôre correct on that. Also, Trump saying Russia interfered doesn‚Äôt mean collusion. Collusion is what you said, remember? [He literally wore a shirt that says he doesn‚Äôt believe in borders.](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/keith-ellison-sports-i-dont-believe-in-borders-t-shirt) It‚Äôs extremely clear where he stands on the issue.  So what about our immigration system that permits over a million legal immigrants each year is incredibly fucked up? Ok, who? >Over the past two months, Democratic National Committee Deputy Chairman and US Representative from Minnesota Keith Ellison has passionately and persistently advocated his position that national borders - specifically, the U.S. southern border - create "an injustice.">Ellison's brash statement on immigration is not far out of line with the Democratic Party as a whole. In fact, a Harvard Harris poll from June states that a striking 36 percent of Democrats support "basically open borders"-an inflammatory policy dangerously out of line with mainstream thinking.http://thehill.com/opinion/immigration/398786-calls-for-open-borders-wind-up-closing-doors-for-democrats >Can you show me a single Democratic politician who has said they want open-borders? I honestly dont think you can.I doubt I get a response, but here you go:>Over the past two months, Democratic National Committee Deputy Chairman and US Representative from Minnesota Keith Ellison has passionately and persistently advocated his position that national borders - specifically, the U.S. southern border - create "an injustice.">Ellison's brash statement on immigration is not far out of line with the Democratic Party as a whole.

Of course he thinks the wall is stupid.  I moderate over at r/Republican. Death threats are nothing new.  Democrats advocate for the parents to stay as well. It is called DAPA.  The wall specifically mitigates unlawful border crossings. No one is arguing it would deter visa overstays. Your source is garbage. U.S. Border patrol advocating for a wall: >The National Border Patrol Council has high hopes for President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs border security policies. >The union's president, Brandon Judd, has been advising the Trump transition team. The union, which represents Border Patrol agents and endorsed Trump for president in March, has encouraged the building of a border wall and the changing of enforcement policies put in place in the last four years.http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-san-diego-border-patrol-wall-20161118-story.html>The NBPC‚Äôs survey, of more than 600 agents in two of the Border Patrol‚Äôs busiest sectors, found just the opposite: A stunning 89 percent of line agents say a ‚Äúwall system in strategic locations is necessary to securing the border.‚Äù Just 7 percent disagreed.https://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/apr/2/border-patrol-agents-back-trump-wall-survey-finds/ You are saying as long as it‚Äôs a family that crosses the border unlawfully, they should be allowed to live in the country. That is an open border policy.  It‚Äôs the solution border patrol agents advocate for. Are you saying they are less informed on the matter than you? Political pundits have no bearing on our laws, as per the U.S. Constitution. CNN telling you Trump is a Russian agent doesn‚Äôt make the claim legitimate.  Way to move off topic. Diverting to ‚ÄúRussian collusion‚Äù on every issue gets old. All I will say is the media apparatus convincing you of Russian collusion has a financial incentive in doing so. Don‚Äôt be surprised when it doesn‚Äôt turn out the way you want it to.  I appreciate your honesty. I just wish more people on the left were as upfront with their positions.  Advocating for a border wall is distinct from wanting more general funding. They work along the border every day, they know what is needed and what would be waste. Much better than you do.  They probably just have a vested interest in deterring unlawful border crossings, and know what is and is not needed to do so.  Well, people who make their living securing our border every day say it is imperative. I believe their opinion is the more informed one.  So you think DACA recipients should have the right to vote? What do you have against border security? People who make a living of securing the border say a wall is imperative to stopping the problem.  >Realistically, a DACA resident is an American citizen without the papers. .... What? An illegal immigrant is not an American citizen. Doesn‚Äôt matter what age they unlawfully crossed the border. If they vote and get caught, they go to jail. Citizenship to the United States is something people spend years acquiring. We don‚Äôt just give it out to people that cut in line, regardless if it was at no fault of their own.  Illegal immigrants have no right to a U.S. work visa. Arguing otherwise is equivalent to arguing for open borders.  I would prefer him to do it after the midterms, preferably if the Republicans retain their House majority. *Edit* - I am actually receiving death threats for this comment. Never change, progressives.  Considering they were prioritizing illegal immigrants over American citizens, absolutely. They also didn‚Äôt merely threaten a shutdown, they actually went through with their filibuster and shut the government down for a few days prior to caving.  Extensive averages are inherently less volatile than their less extensive counterparts, but annual growth is more or less the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù of GDP growth.  Schools can‚Äôt even properly teach reading and math.  There‚Äôs not a single high school ‚Äúsocial studies‚Äù teacher that thinks America is a good thing, and you want to give them Econ classes? Not defending their actions, or yours. 100%.  Expect this tip is much more related to stealing than trying on shoes. Counter argument here:I‚Äôm a huge penny pincher and have tried doing taxes on my own back and TurboTax at the same time to see if there was a difference.  TurboTax was able to identify well over $1000 more on my return than I could, and for that, and the convenience of filing electronically, it‚Äôs well worth giving them a cut.Also, doing your taxes manually with their calculations is effectively stealing. It‚Äôs the education.  It‚Äôs a mainstream practice in schools from an early age to ‚Äúteach‚Äù by committee in these bull sessions with kids where everyone‚Äôs opinion is treated as sacred.  This is the result. You gonna cry? I support a war against Iran.   Now you know one. Rational people know this stuff happens, but there‚Äôs no evidence to show a systematic abuse and issue.  Crackpots usually take small amounts of facts/truth and extrapolate huge contrived conclusions based on insufficient information. That‚Äôs a slow and tasty suicide. Them‚Äôs rookie numbers...In all seriousness though, that‚Äôs the issue.   Typically it takes 100-200 applications before even a good candidate gets a job.   The reason is that there‚Äôs both a lot of jobs and candidates that have gotten more technical the last few decades, and therefore the sorting hat is rather complicated. Love David, wish he was more popular. Ok?  I‚Äôm ok with freedom.  I don‚Äôt have to work for them.  If I don‚Äôt like their rules, I can tell them to fuck off and go somewhere else.We do this even today.  My company does health screening for lifestyle and smoking.  If someone qualifies, they get $50 taken off a month their insurance for a healthy screening, and $50 for not smoking.  That extra $1200 a year was a contributing factor that got me to quit smoking 3 years ago. Single millennial dad here.   I spend on average 15 minutes a day with my dad growing up(Dinner).   Today I spend 5-12 hours a day with my daughter, work a full time job, and my daughter has no family to visit/pawn off on.       It sounds terrible to say, but I want to spend significantly less time with my kid. How are any of these things a bad thing?  (Minus the gender bias rules) My sweet summer child... Seriously, this couple‚Äôs naughty bits are the finest thing I‚Äôve seen in porn.  The guy is the perfect size, not too big and with plenty girth.  The gal has a perfect large and tan ass with a glistening pussy.   There‚Äôs no need for showmanship, just slowly enjoying each other‚Äôs pleasure parts. This is how I want to die.  Drowned by grool. It was that, or the children would starve.  The industrialists didn‚Äôt create the poverty these kids were in, they gave them the only lifeline out of it anyone could give.Fuck you. She‚Äôd be spreading the good word, and I‚Äôd rest on the 7th day, amen. This belongs in r/badhistory That‚Äôs almost identical to a quote from Ayn Rand in Galt‚Äôs speech.  I‚Äôll have to look it up later. You‚Äôre just as bad as the socialists.  Protectionist fuck. Fallout reference? Right in the kisser Sounds like a Russian super villain Were all dying by those standards. Just 10 minutes?  That‚Äôs too quick. I‚Äôm really shocked how cynical the commenters are here.At my company we never fire/layoff anyone because we‚Äôre a growing company and we understand the value of retraining tenured staff.  The hardest part about promoting people from within is training their replacement and I‚Äôve seen plenty of people lose out on promotions because anti-company mentality that drives some of the commenters in this sub to avoid documentation.  I bet these are the same people that complain they can never get promoted. I don‚Äôt understand how this is such a major issue for companies.  At my job we have several married couples at work and a few people who‚Äôve civilly dated one another.  I got my girlfriend hired there at one time and had considered dating a girl there myself. Pretty sure it‚Äôs a std Hire someone.Seriously.  Some people can do a decent job on the install, but you‚Äôre better off hiring someone to sand, stain, and seal. That‚Äôs all the do at your company?The BI Analysts should care about that, the product manager should be focused on full scale platform solutions, working with customers on their needs, and analysis of departmental data protocols for the identification of future projects. What?! That‚Äôs what your police look like?   He‚Äôs so tiny. Every ‚Äúcommunist‚Äù government has resulted in dictatorship.  It‚Äôs not a bug, it‚Äôs a feature. They both hated independence, freedom of the press, free enterprise, and murdered millions.  A hammer and sickle might have worked better here, but they‚Äôre both equally evil. Additionally, when the audience is walking in, talk to them as much as possible.  As an introvert I used to think that this ‚Äòsmall talk‚Äô was pointless, however I soon realized after giving many presentations that my performance was much better after taking 1-1 with the audience because it allowed my nerves to settle and get comfortable with that person.  Need some presentation foreplay. You missed the part where the cop rushes to the scene and shoots the kids because he ‚Äòfeared for his life‚Äô. Except the idea is if you bother and ‚Äútread‚Äù on a snake, you‚Äôll get bitten.  You need guns to bite. Because the suggestion had nothing to do with how bad off someone is. I know, but China‚Äôs not going to let them have it.   The communist party wants to maintain its control.  It‚Äôs only ever let these economic free zones exist and grow so they could harvest and rape them some day in the future. Honestly, I wish every Hong Kong protester could relocate to the US.   I know that‚Äôs never going to happy, but I‚Äôd love to have them.  It would be a win for everyone.   China would get to save face, the protesters would be more free, and Americans would benefit from the inflow of hardworking and freedom loving people. I really don‚Äôt understand why the administration has not thrown its support behind Hong Kong.  In principle, they support American values.  Pragmatically, it would help the trade dispute. No way, they‚Äôd need guns. Whoever is responsible for that needs to be smacked with a baseball bat I take poor kids off the street and clean them up. Actually, most of the leftist outlets are trying to shut down pro Hong Kong posts and material. This is pretty cool.  Keep up the good work. You‚Äôre right, nothing of importance has happened since the IPhone. .5 > 0 Same story with me and my 5 year old daughter.  Hang in there brother! I‚Äôm a single father of a 5 year old girl and my daughter has done the same thing for the last 2 years.   Hopefully someone gives you an answer here I can read as well.

I wish there was.  We all have too much to live for to risk such a thing, but as you pointed out, some people lose everything and do nothing. The kind that needs to die. I‚Äôm really hoping my work today is interrupted by everyone watching the news. No.  No one has mentioned it. I‚Äôve thought about suggesting it to someone but I‚Äôm on a high deductible plan and MRIs are expensive. Sadly, that was the first specialist I saw and I had no improvement after taking vitamin d.  He also gave me a x ray and didn‚Äôt see any issues. No? Birds aren‚Äôt real They‚Äôve been low since before he was elected. Super cool, but isn‚Äôt this illegal ? Gross We make plenty of money and the career is not in the way, however we already have one kid each from other relationships and she doesn‚Äôt want to go through pregnancy again.  Don‚Äôt really blame her there. In this economy?  Doubtful.   People have comfortable lives and have a chance of success in life if they play by the ‚Äòrules‚Äô.If we all lived in squalor and a life on the run against the state and a life obeying a corrupt system were nearly identically painful, then yeah, more people would stand up to cops because they have nothing to lose. Yeah, but the left can‚Äôt waste an opportunity to make you feel guilty for something you had no part it. Earliest to capitalism basically. To be fair, the Euro is extremely low. Actually, you can go very far at Walmart.   Their corporate payroll is massive. Bull shit.   This is terrible advice.I revived 3 promotions in 5 years and every one of them was because I was the hardest working guy on the team.  Went from $25K, to 35k, to 50k, to 75k, and I‚Äôm itching for a 4th.  Had I listened to the above that would never have happened. You suck. ‚ÄòWe‚Äô shouldn‚Äôt do a damn thing.  ‚ÄòYou‚Äô can do whatever the fuck you want. I‚Äôm an analyst and would like to include this in an infographic.  Does anyone have a source?

Is there a higher res version?  Can‚Äôt read any of it. It‚Äôs mostly libertarians and objectivists.  Republicans are a populist group and only care for ideals when it suits them. This is a death sentence for some people.Drug abusers are a real problem, but so is the politics around this issue. I‚Äôm a middle class single parent.

No fun businesses, no attractions, no greenway- but there‚Äôs some stuff about old B.B. guns and if you cross railroad tracks and a ghetto you can get you a decent park. This.  If it wasn‚Äôt so costly to build, demand wouldn‚Äôt be an issue. Gross Usually when I see a job posting for any tech/data related role, about half of the required technical skills go unused.    Additionally people with significant industry experience and proven understanding of data fundamentals are often overlooked in data roles, however on my team those individuals usually turn out to be a significantly better return on investment.    I can train people to become technical, however technical people are reluctant to learn industry knowledge and are far more likely to jump ship after two years. Same here.  His therapy stuff is still a good read though. Respected by anarchists and alt-right guys who like Ayn Rand...He‚Äôs an objectivist, an alright psychiatrist, and plenty obsessed with politics.

Fuck him Sounds like my girlfriend Bernie sucks The fact that the US, China, South Africa and Brazil are all the same color on ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù instantly makes me question this. No?  The conservatives are cheering the anti trust bullshit being taken out of the big tech companies. Welcome to left wing ideology. They died for hot dogs huh? Reminds me of the short story Anthem by Ayn Rand.  She has this really poetic 11th chapter about ‚Äúwe‚Äù. It was rushed but not that bad, people are just upset. There is no way The ending of GOT even remotely compares to Dexter leaving his kid with a killer so he can take a boat into a hurricane to drop off his sisters body and then become a lumberjack. Yeah, it‚Äôs not like there are better/worse ways of teaching or good/poor content or good/bad teachers- they‚Äôre all exactly the same. I read this is Jon's accent. Fuck you I‚Äôll bite, but how are they monetizing the data.  Who are the customers?Speaking of only their taxi model (which is the biggest) and not their other services. Industry wise, I love Uber Freight as a carrier and if they‚Äôre are profitable there then I can see a lot of merit in that model. This is terrible analytics.  Seriously, those numbers are meaningless to all viewers.   The change needs to be representative of something the end user can understand. Does he?

We also have a company Deadpool and Tableau dashboard.  I will upload ours soon. Need a real calculation on the data itself, not the table.  These calculations go into other things other than visuals. Where are all of the Dothraki? Why are they all lining up outside the walls and entrenchments? Why would you put your cavalry in the front/center? Why are their flanks so weak? Why are the leaders commanding from the front?  You have a MYSTICAL ASSASSIN who might come in handy against an enemy who kind of needs to be assassinated if there's any hope. Does that say their unsullied spearmen are 5 Cohorts deep?  Why?   They're spearmen, and your center. Are we not going to discuss counters to the zombie dragon?Nothing about their formation makes sense. Who hurt you!?Oh, wait... Sweet visual.

I love that the middle icon in the seal is an hourglass - brilliant As an independent who hates Trump, the only thing that would force me to vote for trump is Sanders. He was married prior to ever starting Amazon.  This was like a 20+ old marriage. &#x200B;The colors are offset here.   In one pie chart white represents the fill color, and the other uses red.

I‚Äôm not crying, are you crying? Yeah, I actually started with excel based reporting, then learned Tableau, then SQL.I think it‚Äôs a ton of fun in the transportation industry.  I have dashboards I‚Äôve built on saving money on auctions against DAT rate data, analysis on supplier leadtimes, carrier compliance metrics, service, operations and accounting reports, etc.... My transportation experience help out a lot because the regular BI Devs didn‚Äôt understand transportation.   Which is stupid because almost every company in the country could claim SOME benefit from the government and to nullify property rights on that basis it would kill property rights for all.  So? We have similar careers but I‚Äôve gone a different path.  I went to college for marketing but dropped out.  Then after several years of trying to stay afloat I got into transportation.  Did that 3 years and then was promoted into analytics within transportation.  Two years later I‚Äôm doing BI development with the same transpiration company. I hope a cop sees fit to force his dick down your throat, because that‚Äôs the kinda justice you deserve. Enough Bernie Spam Do you remember the name of the documentary?  Very well done Because we killed the rail industry with regulation. -- In Transportation BI Depends.   Protesting for civil rights is good.

No. Is it, because you walk into any collage classroom and many people believe this. Sure.   The big thing to note in office politics was that we were in a transition period which perfect timing for this move.  We were basically starting a new analytics department in our company and out of 12 employees, only I and another coworker stood out.   We had a new Director and the pitch was basically three fold:1) Here is evidence we‚Äôve done 200% than everyone else2) Here is what the market is paying for our skills (60% more)3) Here are the awesome things what we plan on doing for your team/the company going forwardThe new director who also wants to make a name for himself was highly motivated to get us loyal the success of this group.  It was in his best interest to get us the raises we asked for.     BI Analyst. I just got 60% from an internal raise.  Got the promotion as the top performer and I showed them what other companies were offering me.   Politely told them I had no intention of leaving the company but expected them to pay in line with the market and my contributions.The key is to be polite and not pushy or demanding.  Walking into your bosses office like you‚Äôre entitled to a raise is a great way not to get one.   After starting with my current company I went from operations, to an operations analyst, to a BI Analyst in 2 years and 9 months.Was just recently promoted to BI Analyst and am first up for the next analytics manager role.Most of it was 60 hour weeks and in the last year I‚Äôve saved/profited the company over $500,000.  The main skills we utilized was first excel, then Tableau. Fuck you It‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt really care about science, they care about ‚Äúnature‚Äù which they define as anything non-man. Yep.  Bad city governments and immigration laws keeping costs high.   No one will do it, but bet you a private utility, removal of zoning laws, and an open boarder policy would drive down costs overnight. Yeah?  Some people are bums and some people with money make bad choices financially.  Doesn‚Äôt mean the two should ever meet.  City regulations- #1 cause of inflated prices. I started saving cash to buy a home last year.  Putting away about 25k/ year.   My hope is that the bottom falls out when I reach around 100k.   Not worried about the interest rate if I can get a 30% upfront discount. To be fair, our legal process is a nightmare and should be reformed, but that‚Äôs no excuse for supporting the circumvention of the system.    Rule of law + legalize drugs.

I turn 30 next month. This is ultra stupid.  1) Anyone with any sense at all knows that businesses don‚Äôt pay taxes, people do.  Any tax on a business just gets passed onto the consumer. 3) To do this would be to penalize the most important factor in the economy - the capital markets.   This reminds me of the book Anthem. This question implies that culture and economic success have nothing to do with each other.The entire reason why China has grown is due to it adopting some western values. Almost anyone in any professional setting has to deal with this to some point.You just have to set boundaries. I have a very different view than the right and the left.I would have completely open boarders with zero minimum wage and make the path to citizenship extremely hard. Wow, that‚Äôs shitty I‚Äôm not fan of Trump but the stock market and GDP <> wages It is, but sadly most aren‚Äôt this good. I just got my 3rd promotion in 3 years.  Went from $25k to $75k doing a job I love. Wow That sub is a shitshow. Since when were they ever 1:1? You nailed my description.  Hahaha, omg it really is this word for word I didn‚Äôt realize 30% of the country was on my side.  Cool Massive Walmart pickup customer here.  I‚Äôm a single working parent of a 4 year old and never ever want to walk into a store with my kid.   I leave work, pickup the kid, Walmart drops the groceries in my trunk and I‚Äôm home.

Everyone in the valley opposed Ragnar doing what he did- not because he didn‚Äôt have the right to, but because they feared the threat to his life was too great.  Everyone in the valley was effectively acting outside of the law because there was no other way to live. Atlas Shrugged takes place in a society that has drastically diverged from a just society and legal system.  Ayn Rand wrong many essays upholding the value that is the rule of law.  It is a key theme of her essays against anarchism.The key is that the rule of law is a value to those who only suffer minor injustices due to its imperfection.    If you lived in soviet Russia, you have no reason to value what it calls law.So to answer OP‚Äôs original question-Yes, in atlas or soviet Russia.You could not say the same about our modern mixed economies. Of course.  When I was making bad life choices I still worked hard, it just got me nowhere.  Working hard is not a guarantee of success, but not thinking is a guarantee of failure.   For example, even when I was making minimum wage I lived on my own, SAVED $100/month, and invested it.   If I changed nothing else my standard rate of return would put me a millionaire at retirement- and I was a MORON back then.It takes good rational choices to make a difference, not just hard work - even then, Morons can retire millionaires in this country. Meanwhile my company is still on 10.4Ugh Promotion.Dropped out of college my first semester.  Worked tons of minimum wage jobs, had a failed marketing business, had a failed vendor business - fallback was always minimum wage and poverty.  Got into transportation and got 2 promotions in 3 years-  sales/broker, logistics specialist, then business analyst.   Now I‚Äôm about to get my 3rd promotion 5 years in.I‚Äôm 29 for a point of reference.  As you can assume, I made some dumb choices from 18-24, but I learned from them and that‚Äôs what it takes to make it in this life. Ayn Rand valued the rule of law, not vigilante justice.  I should have mentioned I left marketing for operations analytics.I still like marketing, but I like analytics for the same reasons.  Also marketing is where I got all of my beginning analytics skills using site data. Bioshock quote for those unaware.Except it doesn‚Äôt take much for a determined person to go from toilets to white collar. I did in less than 5 years and 5 years is nothing in a lifetime.  Oh how many people would gladly trade my 5 years in America against their 50 years in Soviet Russia. I have a high understanding of the business needs and data storytelling.   My primary role is to identify problems or areas of improvement for the management team.For example- let‚Äôs say a carrier is consistently failing to pickup/deliver on time.  Not only is it my job to bring that data to the attention of managers but I could also run analysis on the financial impact of said behavior.That would be typical descriptive analytics- ‚ÄúWhat is going on?‚ÄùThen there is analysis that identifies lanes to co-load, lanes that could be Back hauled, carriers to remove, prices to be paid, and much more.This is prescriptive work- ‚ÄúWhat should I do?‚ÄùThen I do other cost saving project like replacing OPs teams reporting in Tableau which saves the company time and money.Basically it‚Äôs the most fun job to me.  I get to inform and be informed without having the responsibility of management.‚ÄîFurther, this is both internal and external.  I do this work for our client and our internal leadership.  It‚Äôs 12am and I‚Äôm literally waiting on a query to finalize right now for a project due Monday for the Sr VP of Operations. I do.  I am a business analyst for a transportation company and I‚Äôm good at it.  I‚Äôm the eyes and ears of my company‚Äôs top decision makers and that‚Äôs a great place to be if you want an intellectually stimulating role with great career advancement.  My ultimate future role is technical manager and then eventually director of business intelligence. I pay $460 for a two bedroom in Arkansas.  Just me and my daughter. $300 for food.  No car payment either, but my daughter‚Äôs private school is $850 a month, so that‚Äôs where it gets me. Grocery pickup has made me a strong Walmart customer again, but I know that network isn‚Äôt national yet. That is a big mixed bag of situations you just described.   Some are illegal, some are shitty, some are good.There are no such thing as workers rights.  People have rights.   The lowest worker should have the same legal rights as the highest CEO-that‚Äôs equality.  Just as I have the right to move my property and life elsewhere, so does the owner of a company.Just as I have the right to hire or fire who I want, so does the owner of a company.Just as I have the right to make a deal with any person, so does the owner of a company.Scale doesn‚Äôt change rights.  I know it seems unfair that this large group has the ability to change people‚Äôs lives without our permission, but that‚Äôs their right because they earned their size, capital, and influence.Who knows.  This move they are making could be a mistake.  The cuts in labor could have counterproductive side effect and they could lose money from the choice.But no one protests a bankrupt company, only the ones that dare make a profit.  Sorry buddy, people don‚Äôt run business for the purpose of employing people.   They do so to make money.If you disagree with this principle then you‚Äôre more than willing to go work for free. It‚Äôs not.   People are not property.  We settled that long ago.Children do not have full rights because they do not yet have the means to sustain their own lives through rational judgement. ‚ÄúClose the education divide‚Äù by being racist and letting lower scored applicants in over higher scores applicants. This is completely true, and we know the masses are super intelligent and wise, right? You can in some US bars Yeah, 1% after college because the no one in the test sample had forsaken their careers for children yet. No.  You‚Äôre never going to make enough to pay off the first degree. Interesting move.  I‚Äôm not a fan but many people are.  Will be an interesting debate. So? Your mpg has nothing to do with consumer prices.  Fuel surcharges in transport costs do.Further, fuel costs have only accounted for a fraction of the overall cost increases YOY in the transport market.  Im in the national consumer business and transport costs have gone up 12% for a product that has the majority of its cost of goods in transport.I‚Äôll give you a hint- expect to pay more for bottled water. 100% of this atheist does too.    Thank you!I so sick of the presumption that every person‚Äôs ills are my problem.  Suck people‚Äôs lives suck because some people just suck. Because it‚Äôs law is not a reason. We should All 4 of them?Not enough to block Trump‚Äôs bad economic policies. This has nothing to do with the 4th. As a simi former fan of his, I can explain.He was right about the previous financial crisis for the right reasons, however the problem with him and permabears like him is that the principles which dictate ‚Äúxyz is a bubble!‚Äù Do not always end in crisis(economies grow at different rates, problems are fixed, etc) and if they do the timing of a crash is impossible to predict.  Finally, his ‚Äúsafer investments‚Äù are losers.Take gains in the S&P 500 vs Schiff‚Äôs recommended investments since 2006, I don‚Äôt have the number on my phone right now but my money is on S&P being the better performer. The point is to steal it, not buy it. Teachers don‚Äôt need raises This is really neat That‚Äôs because it IS a coordination when pay is not established by redditors. Simply put, I believe A) It to be financial suicide for an ISPs to give preferential treatment to certain websites and more importantly B) every ISPs has the inalienable right to give said preferential treatment.

Shut up about Net Neutrality  Yes it does. Shut the fuck up about net neutrality.  Everyone on reddit knows already Breaking news: businesses have overhead costs and need to make a profit otherwise people wouldn't bother building and maintaining them. Stuff like the OP is what is not right Not positive from whatever hippy commune you‚Äôre from, but they are positive values for life and business. I support it.  Where‚Äôs my check? You are wrong sir. - Analyst who's company does not give database access Downvoting for the Bernie Tag. Could be just fine for someone with a personal portfolio but no career experience.  I've got a friend that meets that criteria, but doesn't want to work for "The man". I do what I love, and I‚Äôve not had a day off in 2 months.   It does get a little exhausting after so long.

I am most proud of my car purchase.  I bought a 2004 chevy Malibu four years ago for $4000.  Last I checked it depreciated to $2500, so outside of gas/insurance/oil changes I've only been out about $400 a year. Average tenure at my company is 7 years.  1500 employees and rapidly growing.They exist, we just don't hire close minded assholes. Not always true.

What kind of person would not smoke?Intelligent, disciplined, self interested.What kind of person normally builds a long term career and makes more money? This is probably because they're sick of being told they're horrible human beings if they are not eating organic vegan tofu that they biked to get for a low carbon footprint. There were already plenty of bad enough headlines back then that were ignored.  Maybe people are too generous "gasp". Maybe it's a cost of living difference.  When I meal plan, everything is under $2/meal.I do use a lot of chicken/eggs/etc. People need property to live.  If we stripped you of everything you owned, it would suck. $4 a meal is kinda high for meal prep.  What's driving the cost? Could it be just the friends themselves?   I only have two friends, but they're very good friends and were very happy for me when I got my last promotion with a high salary increase. "For police use only.  Not public release " When I'm making less money I cut back on spending- republicans, not so much. You're not alone.  It took me 6 years of hard work to overcome this mindset.I still notice certain triggers but I can brush them aside now. Ouch.  This one hit home.  Well said. What?  Is there more I can read on this theory? Tried anal once 11 years ago, except instead of lube I grabbed the HOT KY back rub oil.  Things got hit in a way she did not expect and she spent the rest of the night trying to shower the oil out of her asshole. The right to your own life, liberty, and property are the prerequisites for all human existence and morality. Us capitalists of the Republican Party want to shoot Trump and these nationalists out of a cannon.   Bad.  Very bad. People, this isn't the AMA.  OP is reposting the AMA. Exactly.  Objectivity is better than beating the other guy. I'm a capitalist and believe this.  I can explain more later. I I don't recall many practicing members of Nazism or state Shinto. A). Every person I've ever met on disability was plenty able bodied.B). Truly disabled people are not my problem.   Technically he's probably right.  Capitalism would let a lazy person or a crook starve- as they should. Where do I bet against them? I think you mean pussy This hits home... You really think the budget is getting passed? I got more of a "pick your battles" sort of point A group is identified by its loudest members. Most of us said enough is enough last year...   It's like the party said, "No one can be worse than Hilary Clinton." And Trump said, "Hold my beer.". People are against net neutrality.   I am against it.  It's hard to see past the echo chamber that is Reddit, but we exist. It would be nice if it or the article had actual research behind the assertions. I'm learning to code now and have already been promised a developer job without a degree.The trick is that I am a rockstar business analyst with a company that treats me right.I also got the analyst job by being a rockstar logistics coordinator.I make the company money, the company helps me grow.   win-win. I am experiencing this.  I've been calling it success whiplash.   My spending has been out of control for over 6 months. Attacking Trump nearly lost him his reelection. Don't think, just circle jerk  "10 people have an opinion about something." I have health problems and work 10-12 hour days.Maybe you're dying?  If not, maybe question your views on work in general.

Heh. /r/republican mod here. Most republicans also think this is some suspicious AF bullshit.Outside of "the Donald", the disgust is very much there. There are many leading republicans that would be down for impeachment, however they might not get reelected if they favored impeachment publicly.  The reason this is common is because politics is derived from ethics.    The Islamic golden age, the Renaissance and enlightenment are a result of adopting the Greek legacy.   That philosophy can also be rejected, which is why the Middle East returned to being a shithole. Was it 5 tons worth? Yes.   Last I checked healthcare didn't grow on trees.

Exactly.  You, I, Rand would all opt out if we could.  Since that's not possible, the only moral choice is to withdraw what is legally allowed. Exactly.  You, I, Rand - would all opt out if possible.   Since its not possible you can only hope you get back a small percentage of what was stolen. 15% is our cap - 25% is what I got.

Something that was taken from you by force?Why, how selfless of you.    Great summary- Objectivist here This is liberal Flint Mi were talking about here... Lol holy shit "I believe and I want to gather all the facts to illustrate this-that the worst curse on mankind is the ability to consider ideals as quite abstract and detached from ones everyday life. The ability to live and think quite differently, thus eliminating thinking from your actual life. This applies not to deliberate and conscious hypocrites, but to those more dangerous and hopeless ones who along with themselves and to themselves, tolerate a complete break between their convictions and their lives, and still believe they have convictions. To them either their ideals, or their lives are worthless, and usually both.I hold religion mainly responsible for this. I want to prove that religion breaks a character before its formed, in childhood, by teaching a child lies before he knows what a lie is. By breaking him of the habit of thinking before he has begun to think, by making him a hypocrite before he knows any other possible attitude toward life. If a child is taught ideals he knows is contrary to his own deepest instincts, ideas such as unselfishness, meekness, and self sacrifice... If he is told he is a miserable sinner for not living up to ideals he can never reach, and doesn't want to reach, then his natural reaction is to consider all ideals as out of his reach forever... As something theoretical, and quite apart from his own actual life. Thus the beginning of self hypocrisy. The killing of all desire for a living ideal. "APR 9th 1934. The Journals of Ayn Rand Good lord that's horrible  What the hell about him is right wing?   No, it's harder for a moron to achieve their own interests.  Life doesn't have ready made answers for what is good for you, and if it did, you still might not listen or commit.  Selfishness takes thought, labor, and discipline.  Think and act in your own interest.I know it's hard to hear, but sometimes being homeless and losing everything is just what someone needs- I know, I was at one point an irresponsible mooch who became homeless.  I do and I am, I love discriminating against stupid Christians and liberals all the time. Uh, no.  Life's not that easy.- an egoist  I haven't gained an appetite.Don't know why.   I have walked more. 50,000?  How is this even news? Fuck you.  A) not stealing from people =\= subsiding.B) the reason religion is and should be taxed exempt is because no government should have the power to tax an idea - this infringing on first amendment rights.If we can tax Christians for being Christian (a church is no fucking different) then Christians can tax atheists or Muslims for their beliefs.Goes to show my fellow atheists are just as goddamn stupid as Christians. It was already hot, even hotter knowing you're a real redditor. You win What are you doing on Reddit actually reading the article and using reason?Don't you know that narrative won't fit into the ingrained hate for capitalism and profit that was taught to us by our college teachers? And yet, you're alive because someone wanted to make money. Yes, that guy. Are you?  It's called property rights. Good grief, I was guessing the pictures were going to be kiddy porn.    At first I thought you were saying discrimination doesn't matter...  Then I realized it's worse, you somehow think someone else's choices are my moral problem.  Fuck off. Colors tell no story Your privacy?  You mean you have some magical fucking right to anonymity while using someone else's cables/servers/connections?  That's rich. Yeah I have a hard time believing most of the people in this thread work in professional environments.Sales, customer service, telemarketing, etc- yeah, that shit happens all the time because those positions are easily replaceable.I saw one guy in this thread with a programming job.  People always bitch more than they brag.   If you base your views on what a bunch of people on Reddit whine about, stay where you are. Flip side of everyone's bitching here.My director knows full well that I will be leaving position in two years.  Will be moving out of his account and into another position within the company.   He's helping me reach my goals, helping me get the training and experience for a future 90,000/year job, and I'm saving his account big $. Ditto, I fully fund mine every year and invest it. Actually, it is for that reason I am against the practice (not theory) of the death penalty.  The system is not as objective as it should be.That said, this guy confessed.Fry him. By committing murder, you forfeit your right to life.All people have the natural right to live, however you can not claim such a thing if you violate another's right to life. That would be a contradiction.   This sicko can not say, "I have a right to exist."  No, you don't.  That child did and that right was taken from him.Killing is not heinous, murder is.The only variable it is essential is certainly, to ensure that the murderer is beyond any doubt-guilty.   I came here to see what kind of college gave students the best ROI, instead I found a bunch of garbage about income bracket mobility. Garbage  I fully intend of working until I am medically unable to do so.  70? 75?  85? Hopefully.  I love work.I wouldn't get wiped out unless the crash lasted for some 10 years.   It would be a postponement of retirement for a couple of years. Move a greater percentage of my savings into stocks. I've been doing this for years.   My 401k and HSA are tied directly to the S&P, and I will invest a couple thousand a year in single stocks for companies who have products I love...  That's it...   I never sell.   I just plan on doing the same thing for the next 40 years. What does it matter.  Her health care is not my problem.  My healthcare is my problem.  Grow up.  Make smart choices. We'd get along.

I'm going to fight for it, but from what I hear the answer is going to be no. Slowly?Basically as the title makes it sound.   I have SSRS reports, excel, tableau....   And that's it. Unfortunately, SQL is not an option.   I don't have access and the previous analyst had already barked up that tree.   I plan on proposing a business justification to mirror the database so the analysts can have access.  It's not an expensive option, but I am completely limited to my local computer at the moment. Yep.  The only way to truly lower taxes is by lowering g spending.   Budget deficits are just taxes later. Thank you for being the one sane voice in a cesspool of stupid. Personally, I wear a lot of vests.    If I wanted to live like people in the 60s, I could work 15 hours a week instead of the 50 hours I currently work.I don't want to live like that. I like the idea, but can he do that with an executive order?   I didn't think that was possible. Love PBS, but this has nothing to do with education.  Highschool diploma.  Dropped out of college. Did some drugs. Had odd jobs for a few years.  Started my own business and did that a few years.  Then got the job as a freight broker for 2.5 years.  Was unemployed for 6 months before getting the temp job.The freight broker experience got me the temp job call, which got me into a booming account at the 3PL. I was a freight broker for 2 years, then was hired at my current company as a temp in March, hired full time as a logistics coordinator(simi entry level) in July, and promoted to Business analyst in November.I should also note that I made it common knowledge early on that I wanted to be the existing Analysts's backfill and got her to cross train me in her role at the same time.With a 40 person team I held the record for overtime hours(average of 63 hours a week over 7 months) and as a result my promotion was actually a small pay cut, but that's what I wanted.I say this not to brag, but to let you know what it takes to beat out coworkers with degrees and seniority who also want the same position.  I worked so hard my health suffered, but now I feel like I can breathe easy and focus on my career without having to worry about not having a degree.  Analyst is just the beginning.  My next goal is BI developer in two years.   I think it will be a lot easier now that all the competition is behind me.  This is due to left/right being pretty fluid and undefinable terms.   They never had a clear meaning and the implied meaning has changed over the decades. The pro-side:I am a business analyst in the transportation field with no degree.   I'm 28 and didn't plan this as a goal until last year when I took my first position with my company.    So in one sense it took me 10 years to get here, and in another it took me 1.   If you want to take the non-degree route then there are a few things to note:1. Company culture is the most important factor.  You want a company that that takes career development and personal growth seriously.  This is hard to find, and it may be beneficial to work with a temp agency so that you can "test the waters".  The temp agency route is also good because it gets your foot in the door and because most white collar jobs that are hiring temps are in a boom of growth. (These are often ground floor opportunities where you become one of the veterans within a year or two). If you stand out and kick ass, you'll likely quickly get what you want.2. Kick ass.  Maybe you're company culture just sucks?I was starting to think the same thing until I found my current company.   Not only do I feel like the executives and upper management work just like me, but we feel like more of a family than a company.    Average 65 hour weeks, promoted twice the first year.Pissed the tenured office politics folks right off. I had some bitch manager do that to me for a high paying sales job.  I told her she was the most rude and unprofessional person ever to interview me.  I didn't get the job but I knew a couple of my former coworkers who worked there and they all did a fraction of the numbers that I did at our old job.I got hired at an amazing company a month later that I didn't even apply for and was promoted twice the first year.Suck it bitch lady. *yawn Funny, I didn't hear much of this rhetoric the last 8 years.Now, almost overnight, it seems we have a problem again.I wonder what happened...? I was recently promoted into a business analyst job with no experience and no degree.I think people too often forget that most jobs go to existing employees.  Like that poop stool ad Fuck you Funny enough I was just proscribed everything you mentioned.  The only thing that has ever worked better was tramadol but no druggie want them because they can't get a high off of it.What does the physical therapy do?  I've been working too much to go yet, but I hope it helps. Eliminate the reasons the companies left in the first place...Taxes and min. Wage.That said, we'd then have a labor shortage for those low paying jobs, so we'd need an open borders policy to get immigrants into those jobs...  Which is the opposite of what trump wants. I'm not fan of Trump, but let's be honest.   Trump would be pro pipeline regardless of the conflict.  By that standard, let's talk about what the local preacher had for breakfast.Or let's not, because it has nothing to do with atheism. So...  A more productive purpose than what they are currently being used for? Technically, 'history' is in the past, is it not? Nationalism, trade protection, anti reason and intellectualism, and whim worship - yeah, great direction. Are all of you people really this stupid?    Down 3% in 9 days.    3%...   3 fucking percent.    Three...   percent.    Was the lack of women working the reason for the lower percentage in the past? But... But...  The lightbulb monopoly?! Lil Wayne is now an apostate from the church of Holy Social Justice and has been excommunicated for his heresy. I'm rather impressed with the comment section of the article. No one deserves my vote this year.No, not even 3rd party. Good on the former, fuck you on the latter. Something tells me that'd just raise the cost of vasectomies and tube tying.I'm against the sacrificing of one's life and wealth for the mistakes of another- regardless the number. Soo... Classical liberal? Thank you for being the only sane person in this cesspool of liberal morons. All countries are mixes economies.  The variance is the degree of capitalism or socialism.    We are more capitalist than China, China is more capitalist than North Korea, etc.. Who is John Galt? Campaign finance laws should be over the 1st. The only possible way for me is significantly lowered fees.    Sooo...  Very?   Got it. Could someone check and see if this included state taxes? Lol.   My market voodoo is not strong. I hate this stupid myth.  American business did well in comparison because we were untouched and we financed the reconstruction of the rest of the world.No business doesn't prosper in rubble. Wealth is created by producing values, not blowing them up. If that had been Rubio, Cruz, or Rand up there everyone would have said it was a horrible performance. That said, the bar is pretty low right now.    All Trump really needed to do to improve is refrain from pulling his pants down and taking a big shit in front of everyone.   We should probably just drop the pretense and have the third debate on Jerry Springer and get it over with. My thought is that if such a significant amount of our voting block consisted of these neo-nazi, alt-right Trump voters in the first place - We should have purged them out long ago.   Except, America's political system and the modern world is not supposed to be like Westros.   Ugh...  The Alex Jones stream?   Kill me.   George Bush created more liberals in this country than any commie college professor could have ever hoped for.   I could only imagine what a Pres.Trump would do.    Now more than ever, the Republican party needs a late-term abortion-of Trump. True, in fact I thought some of the AIRED stuff from the Apprentice was bad enough.   >"You Must Be a Pretty Picture, You Dropping to Your Knees" Well said Seph.  I fully believe that no matter the outcome of this current political season.   It is important for all of us to remain honest, rational, and objective in order to effectively deal with the issues that face our country and party.   Anarchism =/= Capitalism  A) Bill Clinton being a pig who's potentially assaulted and raped someone, does not make it morally acceptable for the Republican candidate to be the same way.B) Bravado is not becoming. If you feel the need to stay stupid and abusive things to impress people, you're not a man, you're a coward who needs the validation of others to fill your lack of self-esteem. C) The most damning thing about what he said was his reference to how fame made it possible for him to sexually assault whomever he wished.

E) Hillary Clinton being evil, doesn't take away or justify Trump's evil.Some people have standards for themselves, for others, and for the position of President of the United States.  Trump supporters will rationalize anything at this point. I'm disappointed with Johnson too.  He's not even a Libertarian, he's a moderate.  He's milk toast.    But at least he's a respectable human being - Which is far more than I can say about the other two candidates.   What's horrific to me is the justifications people are making for this scumbag.A) Bill Clinton being a pig who's potentially assaulted and raped someone, does not make it morally acceptable for the Republican candidate to be the same way.B) Bravado is not becoming. If you feel the need to stay stupid and abusive things to impress people, you're not a man, you're a coward who needs the validation of others to fill your lack of self-esteem. C) The most damning thing about what he said was his reference to how fame made it possible for him to sexually assault whomever he wished.

The modern day social sciences are all about as left leaning as you can get. And they definitely influence students.My Navy buddy is going to school in Texas right now.  He would tell me horror stories of the professor in his government class idolizing Che And other South American communists.

The question was, "name one you admire.".Sorry, I'm drawing a blank here too, there all pretty shit. By definition, neither are we.  We are all degrees of mixed economies.  China just had the greatest push toward a free economy since their starting point was zero with communism. She-Nixon lol Had I been there, I would have shot and killed those thugs.  Does that count? There's a way around that.   I have nor degree, stumbled into a brokerage job for 2 years, got a position in operations at a better company making 40k/year, and now they are grooming me to be their next Logistics Business Analyst on the account that would make 52k/year. "I can be overpaid for unskilled work and do a shitty job and not be fired."Yep, sounds exactly like a union job. Fuck you.It does not matter what luck a person has unless they capitalize on it, which takes work.For example, you can get good jobs and bad jobs, some part of it is dependent on luck, but unless you work hard and do a good job, you will Lose out on the good job and good luck.This is the source of the old phrase, "from shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves in 3 generations."    The first generation worked hard and created wealth, the second maintained or squandered it, and by the third generation it would all be gone...Because it takes hard fucking work. I was right there with you until..  > and their clinging to the myth of "rugged American individualism" Im as anti-Islam as you can get but...    Wait, burkinis?

"Blood of my Blood" has clear Daenerys implications.    Expect heavy Daenerys time. They have to either be on drugs, or have went to college... Looks like im going to have to write another one of my book long posts because clearly the Left's games are winning this war even among republicans.   What the hell are you talking about.  MANY of the main characters are very black and white.   For example:  Davos, Jon & Ned = WhiteJoffrey & Ramsey = Black  I can't up vote this enough Fayetteville is not progressive.  Not being stupid religious does not make you progressive. Apparently you didn't listen to the talk.They are using anti-fraud statutes to go after things that are not fraud. Though I agree with your point, I know of no one that thinks we contribute nothing to warming.   All of the skeptics I know hold positions such as:Human beings contribute to Co2 which contributes to warming.   However the degree to which Co2 contributes to warming is unknown, and therefore the impact human beings ultimately have on the climate is unknown.  The degree to how much warming is going to take place in the future can not be and has not been accurately predicted.  If warming due to our CO2 production is a problem, how is this weighed against it's benefits?If it could be ultimately determined that we are the primary drivers of an ultimately catastrophic warming, this does not automatically make it a government issue or a solution by government, possible.Etc...

Cook excludes Level 4, ((4a) No position/(4b) Uncertain) and for a good reason.3896/3974...  That comes to 98%...  I'm not sure were the other 1% went, but my head hurts ATM, and dont feel like figuring it out.   I'm defiantly not (7) but youre right, I my statements could categorize me as (2),(4b), and (5).   You're really just adding to my point about the subjectivity of Cook's methodology.   That was an April fools joke. No.Implicit Endorsement(As defined by Cook's methodology in Cook's paper):   >(e,g., humans are contributing to global warming without quantifying the contribution.) http://imgur.com/kf4jm1i^^^ Source ^^^ Science is not about what I think or feel but what can be concretely proven as objective fact.   I say, "I do not know the degree to which man has an impact."  Because there is not reliably data and analysis to determine that degree.  What is clear is that the IPCC models that were built with the assumption of a majority impact ended up being wrong.  I personally lean towards the majority being natural, not man-made.However the POINT is that by merely having the admission that man has some impact, even 0.1% impact, I am categorized by Cook as LEVEL 2: Explicit endorsement without quantification.Which he then lumps into his: "97% of studies support AWG 50+%" claim.   > OK, firstly, the 97% is 97% of papers, not 97% of scientists.Why are you using one of my own arguments, and something that was stated above, as something against my argument?   That makes no sense>However, there have been surveys, and they also came to very similar percentages. Which is what the meta-study was about!Yeah, 'studies', like this one.   You know you've won the debate when the other side will not stay on the issue at hand and will instead try to expand the scope of the debate.     I can and have refuted many of those other studies, however, at this moment the subject is ONE OF the studies, ‚ÄúCook et al. (2013).   Quit being a fucking intellectual coward. >So, is it your position that most of the recent warming is natural? If so, you're part of the 3%.My position is that SOME is natural, and SOME is man-made, and the degree is not certain because this is what the FACTS say.    The point is that a position such as that is NOT and endorsement of AWG, and Cook's study is claiming that it is.  What part of, ["under the methodology of their paper... I am a EXPLICIT supporter of Global Warming, when in reality I am not.'] do you not understand?You act as if this is an unimportant distinction, when in fact it is everything. The reason AWG has to be 50+% as defined by both Cook and IPCC, is because if it is ACTUALLY a minor 10% then it becomes obvious to everyone that the vast majority of climate change is outside the scope of our direct actions.The debate would instantly change from:>"What can to do to reverse our BAD AWG actions."To...>"What can we do to protect ourselves from natural climate changes."  The first involves force, and the dismantling of civilization and human lives.The second involves more of what we've already been doing.  lol, right?The irony is, that under the methodology of their paper...  I am a EXPLICIT supporter of Global Warming, when I'm not. MY position(Human beings cause CO2 rates to rise, and CO2 rates contribute some to warming) falls into level 2 =  Explicit endorsement without quantification e.g., humans contribute SOME indeterminate amount to global warming.However, level two DOES NOT fit the definition of AGW which REQUIRES that human beings are the PRIMARY cause.  **Primary, as defined by both Cook and IPCC as 50+%.**  Anyone who says, "Human beings cause CO2 rates to rise, and CO2 rates contribute some to warming" are being lumped in with AWG(50+%) when that is not the case...  I don't believe that, nor do most scientists making that statement believe that. It explicitly states that humans are the primary cause of recent global warming http://imgur.com/bKaqGYXquantified (e.g., humans are contributing more than 50% of global warming:http://imgur.com/kf4jm1iAGW by definition is ONLY Level 1 = "Explicit endorsement with quantification."Even MY position(Human beings cause CO2 rates to rise, and CO2 rates contribute some to warming) falls into level 2 =  Explicit endorsement without quantification e.g., humans contribute SOME indeterminate amount to global warming.However, level two DOES NOT fit the definition of AGW which REQUIRES that human beings are the PRIMARY cause.  **Primary, as defined by both Cook and IPCC as 50+%.**  Anyone who says, "Human beings cause CO2 rates to rise, and CO2 rates contribute some to warming" are being lumped in with AWG(50+%) when that is not the case...

However the theory of AGW([Anthropogenic, or human-cause, Global Warming) is that human being ARE the PRIMARY cause.However within his results he breaks down the summery of abstracts with AGW([Anthropogenic, or human-cause, Global Warming) position (%) as follows:Endorse AGW 97.1%Reject AGW 1.9%Uncertain on AGW 1.0%In formulating his result of "Endorse AGW", Cook lumps together "Implicit endorsement" & ‚Äúexplicit endorsement without quantification‚Äù  with  ‚Äúexplicit endorsement with quantification‚Äù. Thus lumping together papers which suggest that human contribute some portion, with those stating that we are the primary cause.Further examination of Cooks data http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/2/024024/media/erl460291datafile.txt shows the truth of the matter:By his count, the number of articles classified into each category was:Level 1 = 64Level 2 = 922Level 3 = 2910Level 4 = 7970Level 5 = 54Level 6 = 15Level 7 = 9The 97% figure was the sum of levels 1-3. Assuming the count is correct‚Äîthat 97% breaks down as:Level 1: 1.6%Level 2: 23%Level 3: 72%This shows only 1.6 percent explicitly stated that man-made greenhouse gases caused at least 50 percent of global warming. Only Level 1 corresponds to "the Earth is warming up and human emissions of greenhouse gases are the main cause."    Hence when John Cook attributed that view to 97% on the basis of his Cook et. al. (2013) he was misrepresenting 1.6% as 97%. So no, Cook et. al. did not find that "over 97% endorsed the view that the Earth is warming up and human emissions of greenhouse gases are the main cause."A study that is no more than a collection of ill-categorized data intertwined with word manipulation.  If this is what is considered to be 'scientific', then i'm sure I will enjoy these other 'studies'.   resubmitted with screenshot and quote https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/4f7hms/rscience_bans_and_silences_scientific_dissent_in/ I was this kid, but never had a teacher as wise as you've been.   I made perfect scores on every test, and got a 0 on every homework assignment...  Nearly failed out of school. Aww... Downvotes and no refutes.   Maybe the children here will understand drawings and pictures. This is pulled from Cook's own paper.  Table Two:Explicitly states that humans are the primary cause of recent global warming http://imgur.com/bKaqGYXquantified (e.g., humans are contributing more than 50% of global warming:http://imgur.com/kf4jm1iAGW by definition is ONLY Level 1 = "Explicit endorsement with quantification."Even MY position(Human beings impact CO2 levels which in turn has an impact on global temperatures) falls into level 2 =  Explicit endorsement without quantification e.g., humans contribute SOME indeterminate amount to global warming.However, level two DOES NOT fit the definition of AGW which REQUIRES that human beings are the PRIMARY cause.  Primary, as defined by both Cook and IPCC as 50+%.  Therefore to say that 97% of **papers** support AGW is a 100% OUTRIGHT LIE.   -------------------------**BANNED.   /r/science silences scientific decent**   http://i.imgur.com/dgseSJH.jpg----------------------------- /u/SkepticScience You've still not defended yourself against those who's papers you classified as endorsing AWG when in fact they were not...You've still not defended yourself against the fact that Cook et al. (2013) packages 'Explicit endorsement without quantification' & ' Implicit endorsement' with "Human beings are the cause of Global Warming" when those concepts are NOT the same.  Cook et al. (2013)  did not find that "over 97% endorsed the view that the Earth is warming up and human emissions of greenhouse gases are the main cause."Quoting from the Abstract, >"Among abstracts expressing a position on AGW, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming.

(2013) is ‚Äúexplicit endorsement with quantification‚Äù vs ‚Äúexplicit endorsement without quantification‚Äù  Within the Abstract section 2. Methodology, of ‚ÄúCook et al. (2013), we can observe the paper broken down as follows:(1) Explicit endorsement with quantification.(2) Explicit endorsement without quantification(3) Implicit endorsement(4a) No position(4b) Uncertain(5) Implicit rejection(6) Explicit rejection without quantification(7) Explicit rejection with quantification ‚Äúexplicit endorsement with quantification‚Äù is representative of a paper that states that: "Explicitly states that humans are the primary cause of recent global warming"‚Äîprimary cause in usage meaning more than 50 percent.  This is the only category anyone claiming "X number of papers endorse Man Made Climate Change." should reference, because this is the only category where that statement is true. ‚Äúexplicit endorsement without quantification‚Äù  are papers in which the author, by Cook‚Äôs admission, did not say whether .001 percent or 1 percent or 50 percent or 100 percent of the warming was caused by man. The crux of "explicit endorsement without quantification" is that man has contributed SOME amount.Then there is "Implicit endorsement", which "Implies humans are causing global warming.

Comrade!"I don't hate anything or anyone who hasn't earned it. The author's title is satirical of those same Trump supporters that use the term.  The problem with people like you is that you think there's a world where thieves spend their looted money rationally, and it's that fantasy hope that makes it all better. Yes to both.The Min.Wage gets brought up in regards to 'opportunity', employment, the myth of exploitation, win/win relationships, the outsourcing of jobs, and the cultivation of victimhood with the poor.  It reads like a narrative for most of it, however the first 1/3 of the book is pretty academically heavy with graphs included in order to take down Thomas Piketty & Robert B. Reich.  In general they go back in forth with concretes in the form of data and real life examples and abstractions and principles that tie it all together.   It doesn't.  As in it's just a different kind of book altogether.  VOS is a collection of essays in relation to Egoist ethics.Equal is unfair is a comprehensive attack on all modern leftwing issues from a statistical/economics level and a moral level.   Great question.>As far as I've understood it, everyone agrees that the middle class is shrinking and wealth is being concentrated at the topThey actually challenge this view by going after the statistical manipulations of  Thomas Piketty and Robert B. Reich who perpetuated this myth, they prove that all income brackets are immensely more well of than they were in the 70s, they show how an inequality gap is not an indicator of anything, and even if the myths were true it wouldn't give people moral authority to steal the unearned.   Actually, asshole, back in the 1920s when fascism was a new political development, it was widely -- and correctly -- regarded as being on the political left. Jonah Goldberg's great book "Liberal Fascism" cites overwhelming evidence of the fascists' consistent pursuit of the goals of the left, and of the left's embrace of the fascists as one of their own during the 1920s. Mussolini, the originator of fascism, was lionized by the left, both in Europe and in America, during the 1920s. Even Hitler, who adopted fascist ideas in the 1920s, was seen by some, including W.E.B. Du Bois, as a man of the left.It was in the 1930s, when ugly internal and international actions by Hitler and Mussolini repelled the world, that the left distanced themselves from fascism and its Nazi offshoot -- and verbally transferred these totalitarian dictatorships to the right, saddling their opponents with these pariahs.You might discover, if you care to look, that all the essential components of Left-wing philosophy are held firmly in the heart of Fascism:  Collectivism, Self Sacrifice, and Statism.  The issue of Nationalism or internationalism falls under the Statism premise. It does so because the premise of a person in service to the state is the same, regardless of it's size. (Be it a county, a country, or the globe.)  It leaves out(on purpose), the premise of the state solely as a protector of individual rights.Now you might say that there is a difference in regard to property, but i'll ask you to check that premise. Fascism, far from having anything in common with capitalism, is essentially the same atrocity as communism and socialism‚Äîthe only difference being that whereas communism and socialism openly call for state ownership of all property, fascism holds that some property may be ‚Äúprivate‚Äù‚Äîso long as government can dictate how such property may be used. Sure, you own the factory, but here‚Äôs what you may and may not produce in it; here‚Äôs the minimum wage you must pay employees; here‚Äôs the kind of accounting system you must use; here are the specifications your machinery must meet; and so on.This is their Primary difference in theory. However, in practice and principle they are one and the same. "Both ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù(or communism) and ‚Äúfascism‚Äù involve the issue of property rights. Under socialism, there is collective ownership of property de jure. Under fascism, there is the same collective ownership de facto. The right to property is the right of use and disposal. Ownership without control is a contradiction in terms: it means ‚Äúproperty,‚Äù without the right to use it or to dispose of it. If a person does not have the right to dispose of his property, he does not have a right to property. In practice both ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù and ‚Äúfascism‚Äù take communal ownership of an individual's property.Without Collectivism, Altruism/Self Sacrifice, an all powerful state, and the abrogation of property rights-neither Socialism or Fascism could exist. They are ideological Left-wing brothers. I thought the same thing, but the book is written for non-objectivists in mind and the FED is a complicated subject that deserves its own book.   I understood everything written in 'Equal is unfair', however when I thought of my dad reading the book, I knew it was already academically tough for most people.   I now have finished reading 'Equal is Unfair' and all I can say is WOW.  Even as an Objectivist I did not expect it to be so good.   This book is the definitive case against the modern left.  It doesn't just tackle income inequality, but the whole gambit of issues the modern left raises today.   This weekend I am going to buy two copies to give out to non-objectivist friends. I thought this was a April fools joke...  Then I went to /r/Conservative  If Sanders, Clinton, or Obama had said this, every single one of his supporters would be calling them communists or socialists. But it's totally different when Trump says it, because he's going to "make America great again."  Just don't ask him how...  >-‚ÄúIn your opinion, what are the top three functions of the United States government?‚Äù an attendee asked the billionaire.>Trump said the ‚Äúgreatest function of all by far‚Äù is security.‚ÄúI would also say health care, education,‚Äù he added Yeah, no.  Im 100% NeverTrump and 100% America first on foreign policy.    Once again, liberals are making things worse and attacking the only reasonable things Trump says. Thanks shocking considering they are like intellectual brother and sister. Salon.com would get a negative grade. You're a fool. The fault rests with Trump and his supporters.    Just like the fault for Obama winning a second term rests with the morons who nominated the only other person on the planet to sign a health care mandate into law, Romney. Make bad choices, get bad results.   That's because you don't need principles to move the country further to the left, they are required to be right wing. Well said. IF St.louis goes for Cruz it might be possible.   52% currently reporting. Jackson is at 77% with only a small Cruz lead.  If it was a huge lead it might matter, but 33% of a 1.8% lead of some 50,000 votes is not going to do squat.   And Boone is not a big enough county.   You're looking at maybe 1500 more votes for Cruz there. Well that's it for MO.  No more prop Cruz counties left, they are all at 100%.   So close.    I'm so sick of seeing states that would have went to Cruz in a two man race go to Trump. . #neverTrump means NEVER Ted has an unfavorable rating among all Americans of 37%, while Hillary Clinton currently has a 52% unfavorable rating. . Oh, what about Trump? 67% The highest unfavorable rating EVER POLLED.    If it was not for Trump, Hillary Clinton would have the highest unelectability in polling history.       http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2016/03/08/unelectable-trumps-unfavorable-rating-spikes-to-67-percent-nationally-n2130349If Trump wins the nomination, it's an instant Hillary win. His whole speech was against Trump, and rightly so.  lol, this must be your first Primary to say something so stupid. Does anyone have a link to Rubio's speech?   Agreed, and well said. Legalized discrimination?  Not only do I support the right of the religious to discriminate, I support everyone's right to discriminate for anything and any reason.   I actually believe in freedom.  That includes freedom to be an asshole. I'm an atheist and have followed Cruz's career before he ran for president, so I can confidently say you're full of it.    I don't deny that he's devout, however he takes the constitution as seriously as he does his bible, and that I can respect.  I can not say the same for Rick Santorum or Huckebee. There's only one way a someone elected to government can grow the economy, by getting government out of the way.Thinkers, inventors, designers, engineers, entrepreneurs, corporations, etc, grow the economy.   Not anyone in government.   lol, that goes right to my speech yesterday about #NeverTrump and "Anyone's better than Hillary"  https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/4a626d/can_i_ask_an_honest_question/d0xnk15Yeah, I'm behind free speech 100%.  I fully support the right of every Klansman and skinhead(or anyone else) to say whatever the hell they want, no matter how much I hate it.However, If I go into the hood wearing a Klan outfit and shout, "punch black people in the face!" Everyone knows I'm going to get my ass kicked. That doesn't stop me from being the moron I am, and everyone knowing what the result will be. The violent protesters are wrong, and are criminals. However Trump is morally responsible for encouraging this. He HAS been encouraging his supporters to violence.  In fact, I am 100% certain that Trump is happy it happened because it helps his campaign, what does that tell you about the man?Further, Trump is no champion of free speech either(Though that doesn't put the violent protesters in the right.)  Donald Trump blamed Pamela Geller for violence in ‚ÄúDraw Muhammad.‚Äù event. http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/05/04/donald-trump-was-asked-what-he-thought-about-the-muhammad-cartoon-event-in-texas-his-answer-isnt-what-youd-expect/She offended people and has the right to offend people, but never called for violence like Trump has.

Well I partially agree.   I supported Ron Paul's campaign in 08, and 2012.  My first choice this primary was Rand Paul, but when he dropped out I knew instantly my next vote would be to Ted Cruz.  See: https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/499pw7/why_i_an_atheist_support_ted_cruz_for_president/Granted, I disagree with many of Cruz's positions, but I consider him more good than evil, and I can not say that about any other likely nominee in the race on either side.  If Trump wins the republican nomination, I will just throw my vote away in protest to the Libertarian Party. Thank you, and I might add, it's not as common, especially with the /r/the_donald trolls we have to fight off on a daily basis...   But I hope to make it a more rational sub.I fully believe it's what the Republican party needs to get back on track.   Not a Donald Trump, but a new Enlightenment.   Reason first. Polls show that I'm better than your other lying, nasty, job candidates, I'll make you a better deal, believe me. I've got all kinds of friends(in Washington). You need a better negotiator, i'm the best negotiator. Did I mention I have big hands? Could you imagine trying to apply for a job with a Resume in Trumpspeak?   In that case you failed to read the paragraph RIGHT after that:>However, the fact that government forces people to subsidize the university isn‚Äôt Trump‚Äôs fault. Given the widespread existence of ‚Äúpublic‚Äù (i.e., tax-subsidized) property in America‚Äîincluding almost all colleges‚Äîwe have to have some sensible rules governing the use of that property. We can‚Äôt just say, ‚ÄúNo one really owns it, so therefore anything goes‚Äù; that would be total chaos. And Constitutional provisions delimit the use of tax-financed property. In this case, when the university rents Trump a facility for the evening, Trump has the right to use the facility for lawful purposes during that period. Everyone is harping on Cruz and Rubio for not vilifying the protesters enough, and not defending Trump.However, we routinely condemn those like Islamic Jihadists for chanting, "Death to America.", we've condemned the media for race baiting coverage that escalated riots in St.Louis and Baltimore, and we've been condemning Donald Trump for weeks over his hostile rhetoric towards protesters and reporters...But now, when protesters violently attack his rallies, we're supposed to ONLY blame the protesters, and exempt him from moral judgement?Yes, the violent protesters are criminals and Donald Trump has the right to say way he says, however that does not mean anyone should approve of what he's said and deny it's a factor in the resulting violence.People call Ronald Reagan, "The Great Communicator"... Considering recent events I think we can officially dub Donald Trump, "The Great Agitator". Everyone is harping on Cruz and Rubio for not vilifying the protesters enough, and not defending Trump.

Publicly making a veiled threat to another political candidate, backed up by his angry mob. This is devolving into the death throes of the Roman Republic, complete with political street gangs.  How can you not look 2 feet in front of you and see that he in ENCOURAGING this?!   How is this acceptable behavior of a Republican candidate for dog catcher, let alone President of the United States?! Are you people out of your minds?!

Trump belittled it.‚ÄúWhat in the hell is she doing?‚Äù Trump said on ‚ÄúFox & Friends,‚Äù regarding Pamela Geller and her event.‚ÄúShe‚Äôs taunting them,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúWhat is the purpose of it?‚Äù‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt there something else they could draw?‚Äù he asked earlier.http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/05/04/donald-trump-was-asked-what-he-thought-about-the-muhammad-cartoon-event-in-texas-his-answer-isnt-what-youd-expect/ Kasich's theme is:  "Trump created toxic environment" I'm fully against Trump.  What exactly guides you in determining what is 'good', period?  - For anything? Eh, don't evade the point.  What exactly guides you in determining what is 'good', period? Further on the subject of Apple..Trump has stated that he would force Apple to manufacture I-phones in the US.  Not only is this a blatant violation of rights, but they justify it with the economic myth that Americans are worse off for it.    There is no such thing as being worse off through trade, if he wasn't such a shitty businessman he'd know that myth got busted 200 years ago with the end of mercantilism.We send money to China, we get cheaper, more accessible products back. The fact that Americans can afford a smartphone is 100% due to this. If all smartphones were made in America, it would cost you $1500 a phone. If Samsung could produce in china, and Trump made good on his threat to force Apple to produce phones here, they would INSTANTLY drop out of the market because they have enough damn sense to know that their new $1500 phones couldn't compete with the rest of the market.So instead of "Bringing jobs back" he'd just ruin American companies like he ruined his own businesses. >  Except for his foreign policy which is frankly, nuts.Ok, and yet you condemn principles/ideology...    So what exactly guides you in determining what is 'good' foreign policy? Thank you.  I'm one of the few Objectivists in the Republican party, but I hope more follow.   Oh, I agree.  My question to him was a contradiction.   He believes the Republican candidates are bad, and at the same time attacks the idea of principles and ideology...        However the ability to condemn the Republicans itself requires an ideology that goes against the republican one.    Your observation is the same is mine.   8 years ago 98% of Libertarians strongly supported Capitalism.    Now they've been letting 'Libertarian socialists'/'left libertarians' in which is pretty much another word for Democrat. I didn't vote for Rubio, but Rubio's statements on this subject are perfect:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztdzg5kssXk&feature=share I support Ted, but I thought Rubio's response was pretty good:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztdzg5kssXk&feature=shareIn it he didn't really blame Obama at all.   He put the blame on the Protesters, on the things Trump said, and on the media.   To me he sounded genuinely disgusted about all of it.   Libertarians as a whole have one foot in LP and one foot in the GOP.   Rand Paul has both feet in the Republican Party. Two questions:  What do you consider yourself politically/morally?Why do you think a Trump presidency would ruin the US/world?   Talk about tiptoeing the line between 'wishing' to assault people and ordering others to assault people  http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/23/politics/donald-trump-nevada-rally-punch/Even if he has not crossed the line legally, he has certainly crossed a line morally and defiantly crossed a line in regards to what we should accept for a Republican nominee, and a President.   It's one thing to provide the government with national security information you have if they have a warrant.  It's quite another for the government to force you to do damage to your own business to obtain national security information you don't have. The statements ive seen and heard are exactly that he did, however just in case, I'll go double check. You're welcome.I agree with you.   For Apple to comply, they would be forced to develop software that would compromise their own product.  That is as offensive a violation of Apple's rights as could be done.   No, Freedom of speech ENDS when you tell people to VIOLATE the RIGHTS of other people.  I do not have the right to convince people:  "Go rob person X"  "Go punch person X"  "Go kill person X"        Speech ends where force begins, and the responsibly for inciting that force is partially on Donald Trump.   Charlie Hebdo were not drawing cartoons advocating violence against muslims.  Trump and his campaign have incited violence for weeks.   I was asked recently in regards to the #nevertrump:>"How successful can a political party be if it refuses to vote for the person it nominated."My answer:More successful than a party that supports and advocates something that is in direct opposition to it's principles.A political party's purpose is to advocate for a particular political philosophy, and support candidates with that philosophy.If it does the opposite of this, it's worse than an electoral defeat, it's utter suicide.Trump has entered the race and ripped the platform to shreds, he's brought in liberals and nationalists into a party that is against liberals and nationalism. Thus defeating the purpose of having the Republican party. The goal of a party is not to "Grow the party" by becoming more left-wing, our job it to convert people to be right-wing.It's not about winning per se, it's about winning with the right ideology. Anything else is a failure. If it was only about the 'win' then let's join up into one big Republocrat party and we'll win every time... But America will lose.And if someone wants to tell me, "Well anything is better than Hillary!"How do you think we got in this mess in the first place? How do you think the Establishment has maintained their power? By compromising on principles and nominating simi-liberal, deal making, lukewarm candidates on the hope that "Anything is better than the Democrats." We'll that's getting less true every year...The fact is that Trump is a Left-wing pragmatist(like Hillary) masquerading as a capitalist.He didn't oppose the Iran deal, he said he would have, "Gotten a better deal."He doesn't oppose Obamacare, or single payer, he'd "Make it better / negotiate better with insurance."He doesn't oppose trade barriers, he'd "Have them work in our favor."It's all about the "deal", pure pragmatism, no principles. He'll deal with with anyone... establishment republicans, democrats, Islamic terrorists, you name it.He's for destroying whole companies like Apple.He's for eminent domain. (And has used it, a lot)He's for domestic spying.He's against individual rights.And all of that doesn't even begin to list all of his problems, including his rude, and crass behavior.Further, As a member of several Republican/Conservative groups, I am EXTREMELY disturbed by the influx on openly declared "fascists" and "Nationalists" to these groups... These are people Donald Trump say's he's brought to the party.I've never been called a "Race hating", "Zionist", "Jew" so many times in my life. These same people brigand reddit, /r/republican, /r/conservative against anything anti-Trump or Pro another candidate, they sack internet polls, they incite violence, they pretend to be supporters of other candidates to then turn around and say they "Changed their mind"(while forgetting they have comment history).      Trump is a left wing, pragmatic, obsessive liar, and he's cultivated a cult of insanity around him.THIS is what Trump has brought to the party!   Isn't it wonderful?  Trump and his supporters have to be stopped at all cost.If he somehow wins the nomination, I will rally every conservative I can find to drop that insane SOB and vote Libertarian.   Yeah I know full well the responsibility the Left has for this.  That does not make Donald Trump innocent.   >I recognize that Ted Cruz is the candidate that is most similar to my beliefs, I feel that Donald Trump is the better guy to destroy the left.  He didn't oppose the Iran deal, he said he would have, "Gotten a better deal."He doesn't oppose Obamacare, or single payer, he'd "Make it better / negotiate better with insurance."He doesn't oppose trade barriers, he'd "Have them work in our favor."It's all about the "deal", pure pragmatism, no principles. He'll deal with with anyone... establishment republicans, democrats, Islamic terrorists, you name it.He's for destroying whole companies like Apple.He's for eminent domain. (And has used it, a lot)He's for domestic spying.He's against individual rights.And all of that doesn't even begin to list all of his problems, including his rude, crass behavior.What I am describing IS what the LEFT represents.Trump is a Left-wing pragmatist(like Hillary) masquerading as a capitalist. >  Also Ted Cruz's response to the events last night are unforgivable.Are you kidding me?This is what he said, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmxBp4IFe_I&sns=fb   Rubio said the same thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztdzg5kssXk&feature=share   And so did Kasich.  Trump supporters are throwing a fit over this, but nothing about it is wrong.  It's 100% accurate.  If I go into the hood wearing a Klan outfit and shout, "punch black people in the face!" Everyone knows I'm going to get my ass kicked.That doesn't make the violent people right, but that doesn't make the speech right either.The violent protesters are wrong, and are criminals. However Trump is morally responsible for encouraging this. In fact, I am 100% certain that Trump is happy it happened because it helps his campaign, what does that tell you about the man?

However Trump is morally responsible for encouraging this. In fact, I am 100% certain that Trump is happy it happened because it helps his campaign, what does that tell you about the man? More successful than a party that supports and advocates something that is in direct opposition to it's principles.A political party's purpose is to advocate for a particular political philosophy, and support candidates with that philosophy.If it does the opposite of this, it's not merely a electoral defeat, it's utter suicide.   Ahhh...  That explains it. First, no the voters do NOT support Trump. For 70% of the Republican Party, Trump is not their first, second or third pick.  Trump has a meager 100 delegate lead over Cruz because the field has been so wide, and his supporters are that fervent. That is all.   If we had a nationwide republican vote to drop Trump from the party, the 'majority' would kick him out.  However, this country is not a Democracy, and the Republican party is certainly not one.   So since it's not about 'what the voters want', it can only ever be for you 'whoever wins is right', however whoever wins is dependent on winning enough delegates.  You really expect Cruz to waste money and time campaigning in Florida or Ohio when he has 0 shot of winning FL or OH? You expect Rubio to campaign anywhere but Florida with his career on the line? You expect Kasich to campaign anywhere but the only place he could get a win in, his home state?and even 'whoever wins is right' is not the attitude to take...  Do you know why the party exists? Political parties exist to promote a particular ideology/platform. Trump has entered the race and ripped the platform to shreds, he's brought in liberals and nationalists into a party that is against liberals and nationalism. Thus defeating the purpose of having the Republican party. We don't want to "Grow the party" by becoming more left-wing, our job it to convert people to be rightwing.Remember the party's purpose is not just to win, but advocate a political philosophy.  It's not about winning per se, it's about winning with the right ideology. Anything else is a failure.  If it was only about the 'win' then let's join up into one big Republocrat party and we'll win every time...    But America will lose.  And if someone wants to tell me, "Well anything is better than Hillary!"How do you think we got in this mess in the first place?  How do you think the Establishment has maintained their power?    By compromising on our principles and nominating simi-liberal, deal making, lukewarm candidates on the hope that "Anything is better than the Democrats." The thing is, the argument for this is pragmatic, it's to not split the vote.   However for those like me who are neither Establishment or on Team Trump, I don't care if Trump takes his supporters with him.    Not only do I not think they are needed to beat Hillary, I don't want his endorsement of the GOP, I don't want his supporters, I don't want any of it.   The same thing that is wrong with the Establishment, is wrong with Trump; He's a pragmatic, flip floppy, compromising, dealer...  The same thing that is wrong with the evangelicals and the democrats, is that they're completely fine with emotionally based populism and advocate for demagogues...   I don't want that either.If Trump wins he will effectively have combined the worst aspects of both parties into the Republican party.   I'll join the Libertarians if that happens.     It's not close to over yet.     If Trump sweeps Ohio and Florida, then yeah, it will be very hard for Cruz to win outright.    However if Trump doesn't, then it's a long way to June and anything can happen. I'm an Atheist, so no fan of the Evangelicals here.  Further, my whole point is that it's not about winning per se, it's about winning with the right ideology.    Anything else is a failure.   > well, over the last 15 years ive lost hope in the party.Me too brother, but since there's definitely no hope for the democratic party, it's either continue to fight for what is right ideologically in the Republican party, or lose all hope in the entire country...   And I Will Not do that...As for, "If he's winning he should be nominate"  This country is not a democracy, and the party rules are not beholden to that ideal either.   A party is supposed to be a vehicle for a particular kind of political ideology.   It has no point in existing for any other purpose.   Per that purpose, no one should be able to waltz in and radically change that philosophy and direction of the party in a single election.    That's why we do not have one big democratic vote in all states at the same time.   It's a processes solely designed to weed out anti-ideological elements.   I want them to drop out...  After Ohio and Florida.   For winning Florida and saving face pretty much. Who's party?   The party is made up of:   Evangelicals, Establishment/moderates, Conservatives, Consitutionalists, and Libertarians.  (In order from Left to right)Remember the party's purpose is not just to win, but advocate a political philosophy.   Now Trump has brought in Liberals, Nationalists, and Blue collar guys who've never voted and have 0 knowledge of history or political ideals.    If Trump loses and takes those people with him...  I really dont care.    I don't want them in the part making any choices, and in fact I've been advocating for all closed primaries for some time.   Mixed in with the people that Trump brought in are Evangelicals which are pissed that they have never had power in the party, and Conservatives/Tea party guys who are too pissed off at the failed establishment to objectively see who they are advocating for.   If the Trump conservatives actually believe in conservative principles, they will wise up soon enough.   If they and they evangelicals don't, then they can go form their own 'Trump" party.In all though, I do agree with you.  Someone should win it outright and take out the Establishment...   Not Trump though. And the moral difference is? You mean:>"Whatever, I'm going to ignore everything you said and mention something that has nothing to do with the subject."Some of us, (real conservatives, libertarians, and those like me) have spend the last 15 years tirelessly chipping away at the establishment to get the party back to ACTUAL principles and philosophy instead of the moderate, traitorous, pragmatic, compromising deal making of the establishment.And then all of a sudden, a Reality TV jackass comes in attacking the "establishment" and claiming he can compromise and deal better than the compromising and dealing establishment....  And you think he's on your side?        Yeah, you're really immune to 'bigwigs'. You're kidding.     This kind of thing is not only common, but they'd be idiots not to do so.   Trump has done a good job of playing each of the candidates against each other, and yet, no one is throwing a sissy fit about it.     It's clear to everyone(including the candidates; including Trump) that the splitting of the vote has given Trump his 100Point lead.  You really expect Cruz to waste money and time campaigning in Florida when he has 0 shot of winning FL or OH?     You expect Rubio to campaign anywhere but Florida with his career on the line?    You expect Kasich to campaign anywhere but the only place he could get a win in, his home state?         You're ridiculous and your bias is showing.  By that shallow standard, Trump is 'cheating' by wheeling Carson out right at the perfect moment. (Yeah, it was clear he was in the Trump camp for a while)  I don't blame Trump, it's great strategy, I blame Carson for being a Judas to the principles he advocated for and represented.Do you know why the party exists?   Political parties exist to promote a particular ideology/platform.    Trump has entered the race and ripped the platform to shreds, he's brought in liberals and nationalists into a party that is against liberals and nationalism.    Thus defeating the purpose of having the Republican party.     We don't want to "Grow the party" by becomeing more left-wing, our job it to convert people to be rightwing.    Playing the polls? I think of all the clips of Rubio last night, the one on Cuba was by far the best and most important to Rubio's campaign.    It became clear in that moment that Trump was clueless on Cuba.  Trump literally dodged the question and mentioned 'a better deal' so many times that the audience was laughing at him.   Then Rubio was right there to absolutely crush him.  Such a key subject in Florida. http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/03/11/republican-debate-miami-trump-rubio-cuba-5.cnn/video/playlists/2016-republican-presidential-debates/ I was saying that before the debate, however with Cruz pulling out of FL and Rubio's amazing performance in the debate, I'd say he's got a glimmer of hope in Florida.  It's a long shot, but it's possible.   This has to be a joke. I know political terms have been heavily subjectivised, and I blame the Left for that...   But how do you define right wing?   Relevant video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QCbpafD3Pw This is me. Because in his pitch he was insulting the Dems for not wanting to do anything about S.S, then 1 minute later says he doesn't want to change anything.   I'm a Cruz supporter, however this one issue might have won Florida for Rubio.  Forget all the attack ads, just replay this in Florida 10,000 times before Tuesday. There's a reason I don't attend Trump rallies.   I try to avoid being called a "Cuckservative Jew" and punched in the face. Polls, deals, friends... Polls, deals, friends... Polls, deals, friends... If I took a shot every time Trump mentioned polls, I'd be dead halfway through the debate.   How many times does this pragmatic moron have to repeat it before Trump supporters wise up and realize he's full of it?    Paraphrasing Trump's opening, "I brought liberals into the party, along with millions of people who never voted and couldn't find Washington on a map."Cruz on Trump's neutral stance with Israel: "This is exactly the kind of moral relativism Obama has." Hit the nail right on the head.Rubio: "I'm not interested in being politically correct, i'm interested in being correct." Was a fantastic line.    Rubio on Cuba blew Trump out of the water.And did anyone catch this early on?  Trump: "The Dems don't want to do anything with S.S"Trump: "I'm leaving S.S as is."      Uhhh... ok? My internet cut out at the end and I missed it.   Does anyone know where the full upload will be?    YouTube CNN maybe?  According to Gallop, Trump has the highest unfavorable rating (67%) EVER POLLED. Talk about unelectable and unable to beat Hillary.   Too bad his supporters are too stupid to google Polls, deals, friends... Polls, deals, friends... Self funding my campaign... Polls, deals, friends... Polls, deals, friends...  Why not put some rat poison in your food?  You can't compromise on basic principles.  Cruz won't, and Trump knows Cruz wont make a deal. We are legion.   But! But!  He has Polls, deals, and friends! Trump = Hillary victoryWhich is what the Clinton News Network wants. He's trying to reverse his image as a nutjob now that he's in the lead. It did.   I meant to say Rubio, but I'm so used to bragging on Cruz that I wrote Cruz.   Polls, deals, friends...  Polls, deals, friends...  Polls, deals, friends...  Polls, deals, friends...     Shut up Trump HOLY SHIT Rubio is killing it tonight.   He might just win Florida.   If I took a shot every time Trump mentioned polls, I'd be dead halfway through the debate.The trade tariff "Threat" bs doesn't fly Trump. The businesses in China don't dictate what the Chinese government does. If you had any idea what you're talking about, you'd know that. You're bluffing the wrong damn group.Rubio: "I'm not interested in being politically correct, i'm interested in being correct." Ha, that's a good line.Cruz on Trump's neutral stance with Israel: "This is exactly the kind of moral relativism Obama has." Hit the nail right on the head. HOT DOG what an answer from Cruz. Trump:  "The Dems don't want to do anything with S.S"Trump:  "I'm leaving S.S as is."   Nooo....   I hate DHS more than almost any other department, but that's a long debate. You're right, but Nationalism also follows under the Collectivist premise.   Eh.  What a fucking horrible answer from the lot of them.  They are all basically 'me too'ing Trump's protectionism.   You say you like free markets, then you talk about regulating who/how/what businesses do and hire.   This is why the Democrats are having an easy time moving this country farther to the LEFT.   Protectionism is a form of collectivism or socialism. Its basic premise is that government can and must alter the marketplace to foster what the government considers its own interests.    Paraphrasing Trump's opening, "I brought liberals into the party, along with millions of people who never voted and couldn't find Washington on a map."Yeah Trump, we know you have the idiot vote. Paraphrasing Trump's opening, "I brought liberals into the party, along with millions of people who never voted and couldn't find Washington on a map."Yeah Trump, we know you have the idiot vote. I second the motion! You might support the nominee Reince Priebus, but if it's Trump then it's no longer my party. I was thinking the same thing.  Sellout just wants a cabinet position.  Bet he was on the Trump team for a while too, and just waiting to endorse in the right moment.   At this point, they ONLY way I will ever respect Rubio again is if he spends the entire night going kamikaze on Trump, and at the end for his closing statements, he endorses Cruz. Who ever expected the Clinton News Network to be honest and on time.   Luckily we don't have to rely on them at 3AM.   Freakin Carson.   I never want to hear from that slow brain fool again.  His endorsement of Trump goes against everything he ever said.   A traitor to principle. Man I hope CNN gives it to Trump like FOX did, but they probably won't because they want the unelectable Trump against Clinton.   Exactly, that was truly the amazing thing about Ronald Reagan, he didn't 'win' leftists to his side by dealing, compromising or placating...  he converted them.    Same for my hero Ayn Rand.  I was a liberal until I read her works.That's why hardcore leftists hate them so much. A stark difference to Trump's assaulting of protesters.   As I've said before:>>I am EXTREMELY disturbed by the influx on openly declared "fascists" and "Nationalists" to Republican and conservative groups... My local republican group has been overrun, and I stopped going. These are people Donald Trump say's he's brought to the party. I've never been called a "Race hating","Cuckservative", "Zionist", "Jew" so many times in my life. These people have to be stopped at all cost.Combine that with people like Sarah Palin, David Duke and Alex Jones backing Trump... Yeah, I can hate his supporters. Sometimes the truth hurts.     Government education has made a country of superficial stupid people, and republican voters are not exempt from this.  Consider all the people on the right who follow Alex Jones.   If all you knew was that Sarah Palin and Alex Jones back Trump.   While Mark Levin and Thomas Sowell back Cruz.  That should be enough to make an informed decision.   Ah yes, that endorsement says SOOO much...    Meanwhile, Sarah Palin, David Duke and Alex Jones's endorsement of Trump... says nothing of The_donald....    /s      >Tila TequilaO.o     Is she a famous stripper?   If all you knew was that Sarah Palin and Alex Jones back Trump.   While Mark Levin and Thomas Sowell back Cruz.  That should be enough to make an informed decision.   I don't think Paul can endorse anyone, his reelection for senate is already enough political heat thanks to Trump. If all you knew was that Sarah Palin and Alex Jones back Trump.   While Mark Levin and Thomas Sowell back Cruz.  That should be enough to make an informed decision.   Hunter/gatherer?    I'm a right-wing atheist, so yeah.   We make up the 5% of atheists that aren't dirty commies. >There is no difference between communism and socialism, except in the means of achieving the same ultimate end: communism proposes to enslave men by force, socialism‚Äîby vote. It is merely the difference between murder and suicide. - Ayn Rand  Russia =/= Soviet UnionRussia left to itself would have starved itself out much quicker had it not gobbled up half the east.  They sucked all those border counties bone dry, and all through the cold war the US was sending them aid. (Which I consider downright treason)  You can't.    I just know I'm not as worried about his religion because I've followed his career for several years.   I don't consider Cruz a bad guy, I consider him one of the good guys, even if I disagree on many of his views, and am worried how his religion will effect him.   However I consider sanders Hillary and trump as pure evil.That said, Cruz's actions have showed he's not follower of that religiously inspired "compassionate conservatism " like Bush was. That bothered me too, but I've followed Cruz's career long enough to know he doesn't do that.Still bothered me though. The reason why he is getting so much flack for it is that Santorum, Huckebee and bush really ruined people for devout candidates.I'm voting for Cruz though. >Ohio Governor John Kasich bests Donald Trump among Buckeye Republicans by a 34 to 29 percent margin.  Ted Cruz is third with 19 percent.  Marco Rubio trails with just 7 percent.Rubio just a few points ahead of "I dont know". >Ohio Governor John Kasich bests Donald Trump among Buckeye Republicans by a 34 to 29 percent margin.  Ted Cruz is third with 19 percent.  Marco Rubio trails with just 7 percent.Rubio just a few points ahead of  "I dont know" > He preached "compassionate conservatism," Bingo.   The Republican version of government mandated altruism.> The only conservative presidents we've had in the last 100 years are Coolidge in the Roaring Twenties and Reagan in the 80s.Mostly Coolidge, everyone loves Reagan's talk, but I wished he walked the walk more.  According to Gallop, Ted has an unfavorable rating among all Americans of 37%, while Hillary Clinton currently has a 52% unfavorable rating.  Seems pretty damn electable to me...   Oh, what about Trump?    67%    The highest unfavorable rating EVER POLLED. http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2016/03/08/unelectable-trumps-unfavorable-rating-spikes-to-67-percent-nationally-n2130349   But yeah "Trump is the only one that can win" Keep drinking the koolaid dude. Go fuck yourself you POS redneck.   I have voted Republican in every election for the last 15 years, if Trump is nominated, I wont.And, Only chance to win?  are you kidding me? As far as polls go, it shows Ted beating Hillary.   According to Gallop, **Ted has an unfavorable rating among all Americans of 37%**, while **Hillary Clinton currently has a 52% unfavorable rating.**  Seems pretty damn electable to me...   Oh, what about **Trump?    67%**    The highest unfavorable rating EVER POLLED. http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2016/03/08/unelectable-trumps-unfavorable-rating-spikes-to-67-percent-nationally-n2130349   But yeah "Trump is the only one that can win" Keep drinking the koolaid dude. Spoken like a true demagogue worshiper.  So what's to guide a man without principles, hmm?     Your pragmatic F√ºhrer is a demagogue of whim.   They're the biggest public promoters of conservative ideals...  Who would you pick?   Yeah...   That is a stretch I admit.   I get the anger..  We get the anger!!   We're angry too!But reread what you wrote and ask yourself if that's rational.   If stupidity got us into this mess, I don't think angry stupidity will get us out.   My little Orange message button was going off so much in such a short amount of time...  Idk what happened...   I just typed.   It's a reference to "god is dead". Dude, I'm an atheist, you're preaching to the choir there.  Trump is Pro WHOS business?   Because he certainly is not a Capitalist.He doesn't oppose Obamacare, or single payer, he'd "Make it better / negotiate better with insurance."He doesn't oppose trade barriers, he'd "Have them work in our favor."It's all about the "deal", pure pragmatism, no principles. He'll deal with with anyone... establishment republicans, democrats, Islamic terrorists, you name it.He's for destroying whole companies like Apple.He's for eminent domain. (And has used it, a lot)He's for domestic spying.He's against individual rights.Trump simultaneously is one of the most anti-capitalist candidates running and does the most long term harm to capitalism by making people think, "Oh, this is what capitalism is about." Thus giving anti American assholes like Bernie sanders moral justification.You think Protectionism is pro-business? Protectionism is a form of collectivism or socialism. Its basic premise is that government can and must alter the marketplace to foster what the government considers its own interests.Trump‚Äôs error stems from his lack of attention to ideology. He claims to love Ronald Reagan. Although an inconsistent pragmatist in practice, Reagan promoted the ideology of free markets and capitalism, often quite eloquently. Reagan would not agree with Trump‚Äôs protectionism; nor should anyone who favors Freedom.There is no such thing as being worse off through trade, if he wasn't such a shitty businessman he'd know that myth got busted 200 years ago with the end of mercantilism.We send money to China, we get cheaper, more accessible products back. The fact that Americans can afford a smartphone is 100% due to this. If all smartphones were made in America, it would cost you $1500 a phone. If Samsung could produce in china, and Trump made good on his threat to force Apple to produce phones here, they would INSTANTLY drop out of the market because they have enough damn sense to know that their new $1500 phones couldn't compete with the rest of the market.So instead of "Bringing jobs back" he just ruins American companies like he ruined his own businesses. You didn't answer me.   I disagree if you mean with his first election, I thought he was actually principled.    By the second rolled around I was ready to try him for Treason.     I'm right there with ya buddy.  At this point though, it's already a sign since they haven't written ALL of these jokers off.  To me, Cruz BARELY has his head above water, while the rest are just too horrible to even joke about.   Even if Cruz does win I won't be happy, I'll just know that we have, 'a little more time'.     If Cruz doesn't get the nomination, I'll just protest vote LP.   You see, you mention two things:1) "He's a theocrat" 2) "He's unelectable.  I prove BOTH of those things wrong, and you downgrade the first to "He says god bless!", and completely avoid the second that PROVES your candidate is the unelectable one.    Then, you bring up more bullshit to shore up your argument.Spoken like a true liberal.    I'm sure when you assholes elect our first female criminal to Commander-in-Chief, you won't be around for my 'I told you so."   Are you old enough to remember the platform Bush ran on in 1999?    MUCH MUCH different than what he actually did.    2000 was an innocent mistake.   And I don't know what could of gone different for 2004.   "Shame me once, you won't get fooled again."  McCain and Romney were the real nomination mistakes. I'm an Atheist and I support Cruz.    The media likes to paint Ted Cruz as this 'pastor-in-chief' candidate that is only supported by the religious right/evangelicals, however Ted Cruz is no Huckabee/Santorum. I NEVER would vote for those two.  Both Huckabee and Santorum expanded government, cared only for social issues, and happily trampled on the Constitution.Meanwhile, Cruz not only has been a scholar of the Constitution, but you can hear the reverence he has for it. In this respect he's much more like Calvin Coolidge.As far as electablity, they said Ronald Reagen was too conservative too.    As far as polls go, it shows Ted beating Hillary.   According to Gallop, **Ted has an unfavorable rating among all Americans of 37%**, while **Hillary Clinton currently has a 52% unfavorable rating.**  Seems pretty damn electable to me...   Oh, what about **Trump?    67%** http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2016/03/08/unelectable-trumps-unfavorable-rating-spikes-to-67-percent-nationally-n2130349    Good answer, and I agree.   However, if the doctor tells me I have Cancer, I'm going to at least take it seriously and get a second opinion before dismissing it.    To his credit, Beck is worth 250Million now...   Even I've thought about putting a show together and taking pointers from Beck.   So...   A Conservative would shrink the debt, shrink government, and avoid being the policemen of the world...  Bush did the opposite of that...     (You also forgot to mention Medicare Part D)  And you blame Conservatism?    Seems like not having conservative principles was the problem, and you want to elect a guy with no principles....Good luck with that. Yeah I know, I already got Part 1, 2, 3, and 4 of this story.   I don't want to elect part 5.   How many Donald Trump supporters does it take to change a lightbulb?    "Look, we can change the lightbulb. That I will tell you. We're changing it, ok? And I understand what you're saying, I hear it all the time. People call me and say "Is the lightbulb really dead?". Thats what they are asking me, its unbelievable. The lightbulb is in big trouble, that I can tell you. But we are going to change it." That's not the point.   I'm not worried about good speaking ability, I'm worried about demagogues...Which come in two forms:   Ideological(Bernie) and Pragmatic(Donald).    Bernie's no great speaker.  Joseph Stalin was a horrible speaker.      I only see you mentioning Hitler.   /r/gruntledsymbiont mentioned Mussolini.   There is a considerable difference.    Ben Shapiro, Thomas Sowell, Glenn Beck, Mark Levin...How many pillars of modern conservatism do Trump supporters need to take the hint?    Cruz IS the conservative candidate.   Populism and demagogues go hand in hand.    The Romans knew this 2200 years ago. Yep, and unlike Glen Beck who is more controversial, very few have a unfavorable view of Mark Levin.     So politically correct.  I like it.

But we're just talking about the horse race itself.  https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/707656213408915456Apparently, he just tweeted about opening a campaign office in North Carolina. If you have a twitter account, reply, and tell him what you think. That would be my dream.   It would restore all the respect I had lost for Rubio. Winning both Ohio and Florida for Trump knocks a very serious blow to the idea of Cruz winning the delegate race.   http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/delegate-targets/republicans/ Ha, that's pretty funny.  Do it Rubio! If Rubio could win Florida it wouldn't be a big deal, but it's highly unlikely he closes the gap, and since Florida is a huge 100 delegate winner take all state, Rubio is making a gamble that will likely give the state to Trump.Even if he drops out and Trump still wins FL, his dropping out also makes it more likely for Kasich to take Ohio. Then after taking Ohio from Trump, Kasich should drop out.Rubio is ruining this election for everyone not Trump. Throw in the towel! On the bright side, those 66 Ohio delegates would not go to Trump. Hot dog!   Finally a glimmer of hope.   Do it Rubio!   If Rubio could win Florida it wouldn't be a big deal, but it's highly unlikely he closes the gap, and since Florida is a huge 100 delegate winner take all state, Rubio is making a gamble that will likely give the state to Trump.Even if he drops out and Trump still wins FL, his dropping out also makes it more likely for Kasich to take Ohio.   Then after taking Ohio from Trump, Kasich should drop out.  Rubio is ruining this election for everyone not Trump.  Throw in the towel! Go back to /r/the_donald   > Furiosa is going for the other guy - this looks like some major members of the establishment making up their minds but sending out their "outsider" to do it... Yeah, I wish the establishment would stop pussyfooting around and throw in the towel.  If establishment money came behind Cruz in force then Trump would be done for.  No, most of us Paul supporters jumped onto team Cruz, the rest decided to pout and vote in the LP primary.   I'm not against voting Libertarian, but if my vote can count toward something meaningful I stay Republican.  However if It's Trump vs Hillary, I'll throw my vote away in protest.It also would be politically bad for Paul to endorse anyone as he is running a state election himself.  Though, after Trump tried to get his supporters to derail Paul's Senate campaign, it kinda became a moot point, and at that point I would have endorsed Cruz. Almost every republican I know has a favorable view of her. What I was saying above applies to him actually winning...However, as for him winning, Donald has the highest unfavorables, of any presidential candidate, in either party, in American HISTORY. (Technically in 80 years, which is how long we've been recording such data.)If Trump didn't exist, that award would go to Hillary Clinton.  http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2016/03/08/unelectable-trumps-unfavorable-rating-spikes-to-67-percent-nationally-n2130349This was already the case at 60% back in January: http://www.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/188936/trump-negative-image.aspx>**"Hillary Clinton currently has a 52%** unfavorable rating among all Americans, while Jeb Bush is at 45%, Chris Christie 38%, **Ted Cruz 37%**, Marco Rubio 33%, Bernie Sanders 31% and Ben Carson 30%. **Trump's 60%** is clearly well above all of these. "Now it's even higher at 67% So?I know anymore having support by Goldman Sachs is like getting support from David Duke, but....  So?      Had bush stuck to the 1999 playbook he campaigned on, he would of been great...   Problem is he didn't.   Between his big government cronyism and his treason to the military, he didn't come close to the things he campaigned on. Actually as an atheist if I thought Cruz was Santorum or Huckebee then I wouldn't vote for him, but I've followed his career for some time and he's no one trick pony. It doesn't work that way, all claimed delegates are locked in for the first vote, even if a candidate drops out.    In the "why are you supporting trump" thread, there is literally a Bernie sanders supporter saying he's voting in the republican primary for that very reason.   His comment history is what shows him as a sanders supporter. If the establishment wanted anything to do with Cruz  they would have thrown their support behind him already, and had Rubio and kasich drop out and endorse Cruz, but instead they're holding out for this BS brokered convention.   If anything, they know Cruz won't play ball with them, Trump however is always have willing to deal.  If it came down to the establishment picking Cruz or Trump, they would pick Trump. He worked as a domestic policy adviser for his 1999 campaign...  Then worked as the Associate Deputy Attorney General...That's about as far removed from being involved with the establishment as anyone on the national stage can get.And if you were old enough to remember, Bush's 1999 campaign looked amazing and was 100% someone to support, then, once he took office that all changed.   I did not vote for him in 04. Florida is winner take all though, and he's losing big time. If you look at his comment history, he's a Bernie Sanders supporter.  also:>If Trump wins the nomination and either wins the presidency or makes it close look for both Republicans AND Democrats to follow his scorched earth methods.Even if he crashes and burns he's lowered the bar considerably for what constitutes "acceptable" rhetoric.And possibly a nihilist?   It's hard to find a Republican that hates Bush more than me...    His actions in regard to the military and ROE I consider 100%, straight up treason.   So I fully understand the hate for Establishment republicans...     However, Cruz, who I support isn't one of them. I never would of expected a Paul supporter to move to the Trump camp.   That's like night and day... I'm a millennial atheist and I voted for Cruz.  In fact Cruz gets the most millennial republican support.   As for the issues you mentioned, Trump is all for carpet bombing a civilian area...    Cruz doesn't hate the gay community, I myself am against government paid for Birth control(not BC in general), and there is really nothing Cruz could do to reverse gay marriage... The fact that he's principled and hard headed is why I like him.    Washington is full of deal making pragmatists. I'm right there with you on the pissed off part, but to me...Cruz is like a FU grenade I pull the pin on and throw at the badguys.Trump is the explosive vest that takes out the bad guys and me along with it. Well shit...  So much for the idea of the other HI counties going to Cruz... As I said yesterday:>I am EXTREMELY disturbed by the influx on openly declared "fascists" and "Nationalists" to Republican and conservative groups... My local republican group has been overrun, and I stopped going. These are people Donald Trump say's he's brought to the party. I've never been called a "Race hating","Cuckservative", "Zionist", "Jew" so many times in my life. These people have to be stopped at all cost. PJ Media's Bill Whittle is one of my favorites. Ditto, everything you just said. I'm already past that point. > Trump will sweep southern Missouri and its meth labs.As someone born and raised in North Central Arkansas, I can attest to this. lol, dick... Yes.    >Not everyone can be a programmer; if they became programmers, or any other job that "requires intellect", there wouldn't be enough jobs to go around. You need more than that for day to day living, and the second you don't because of automation, or outsourcing because businesses "profit from it" we'll all be on government controlled universal basic income, and we'll be stuck in some new feudal system. No, but there is no big 'job' pie either.  Jobs/Careers are not some static thing, 100 years ago there were no programmers, electricians, taxi drivers, etc...  200 years ago there were no radio operators, train engineers, etc...Only a Billion people existed on the planet 200 years ago, and yet there are tens of thousands of jobs that have changed or gone extinct.This is because human survival and wealth creation is no done by physical effort, but by thinking beings.  Productive thought is a limitless resource.  So ask yourself, Are you poorer today because the automobile exists? Trains? Tractors? Trucks? The computer? The modern operating system? The smart phone?Are you poorer today because these things eliminated labor via the plow and horse, or the telegraph operator?Do you have more free time, and more luxury than than those 100 years ago?Are you poorer today because the Andrew Carnegies and Steve Jobs of the world made astronomical fortunes?Are there fewer jobs than there were 100 years ago?NO, NO, NO, and NO!We are all far richer because those things exist, we are far richer because those jobs are gone, we are far richer because those men walk this earth and made fortunes, and they are BILLIONS of more jobs today.How many people made money from programming I-phone apps in 1915? No one. Who 'Needed' I-phone apps in 1915? No one? How about data analysis? Nope. Cable TV programs? Nope. Oceanic oil drilling? Nope. Demand for Netflix? Notta.  Surround sound speakers? Nope. And the list goes on, and on, and on,...Throughout the entire history of mankind all the way to the cave, in fact the very nature of man is that man does not survive via physical strength... We survive by the use of our minds, we create values through our reason.In fact the machines we have today are already produce everything we need, we are just making them better.If AI based machines could autonomously produce all the physical values we need to a degree where almost no physical human effort was required, the ACTUAL result would be a substantial drop in the cost of living!If food, cloths, wood, housing, etc... cost 30% of what it costs today. How much more time do you have to devote to other work? What happens to poverty globally?Such an innovation would make poverty practically extinct. Such an innovation would push the whole world towards learning more, thinking more, etc As it has been since the industrial revolution and the creation of capitalism.>Because you need to care about your nation and the people in it more than the dollar and cent values they produce and consume. If not, you become the type of cyberpunk hellhole China's cities like Beijing are becoming.I do care about things other than money, I care about my life, my prosperity, my education, my daughter, and her life, prosperity and education...     And that's why I care about the dollar.As for caring about my nation?   Hell no, I care about me, and my nation in so far as it effects my life for better or worse.     No that came from the Washington Post-ABC News national poll March 3-6, 2016http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/politics/washington-post-abc-news-national-poll-march-3-6-2016/1982/ Are you blind?

It is a service job that will ultimately be taken over by more efficient structures through programming systems.   While doing my day job, i'm also learning to Program, and production related job.  It is a skill that will never be taken over because it requires intellect in production.Do you know where we would be if you Luddites won the argument against the loom 200 years ago?

Because we profit from it.You know why China trades with us?   Because they profit from it.Anyone in China with any sense knows this...And anyone with any sense here knows this... Have you met Bernie supporters?   No one is getting Bernie supporters but Bernie, they most likely won't even vote for Hillary in the General. Oooh, Good idea. The reason I'm not voting for Hillary has nothing to do with having a (D) by her name, same goes for Trump.   There is no such thing as being worse off through trade, that myth got busted 200 damn years ago with the end of mercantilism.We send money to China, we get cheaper, more accessible products back. The fact that you can afford a smartphone is 100% due to this. If all smartphones were made in America, it would cost you $1500 a phone. If Samsung could produce in china, and our would be 'asshole in chief' made good on his threat to force Apple to produce phones here, they would INSTANTLY drop out of the market because they have the good goddamn sense to know that their new $1500 phones couldnt compete with the rest of the market.

If you'd actually studied history or read a book in you life you'd know what im talking about, so ill give you some definitions and quotes:On the Morality side:Collectivism:>is the moral stance, political philosophy, ideology, or social outlook that emphasizes the significance of groups‚Äîtheir identities, goals, rights, outcomes, etc.‚Äîand tends to analyze issues in those terms. Collectivism is a basic cultural element that exists as the reverse of individualism (in the same way high context culture exists as the reverse of low context culture), and in some cases stresses the priority of group goals over individual goals and the importance of cohesion within social groups (such as an ingroup, in whichever specific context it is defined).  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CollectivismThis so called 'vague equivocation" is even used in the definitions you rely on:>Fascism was originally founded by Italian national syndicalists in World War I who combined extreme right-wing political views along with collectivism... https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/FascismIf you would like some examples, educate yourself:>‚Äú**The concept of personal liberties of the individual as opposed to the authority of the state had to disappear**; it is not to be reconciled with the principle of the nationalistic Reich. There are no personal liberties of the individual which fall outside of the realm of the state and which must be respected by the state. **The member of the people, organically connected with the whole community, has replaced the isolated individual; he is included in the totality of the political people and is drawn into the collective action.** There can no longer be any question of a private sphere, free of state influence, which is sacred and untouchable before the political unity. The constitution of the nationalistic Reich is therefore not based upon a system of inborn and inalienable rights of the individual.‚Äù‚ÄîErnst Rudolf Huber,[138] official spokesman for the National Socialist German Workers‚Äô Party, 1939Altruism/Self Sacrifice:>"the principle or practice of unselfish concern for or devotion to the welfare of others (opposed to egoism )." Or more accurately‚Ä¶. "The basic principle of altruism is that man has no right to exist for his own sake, that service to others is the only justification of his existence, and that self-sacrifice is his highest moral duty, virtue and value."More examples..>‚Äú[O]ur German language has a word which in a magnificent way denotes conduct based on this spirit: doing one‚Äôs duty [Pflichterf√ºllung]‚Äî**which means serving the community instead of contenting oneself**. We have a word for the basic disposition which underlies conduct of this kind in contrast to egoism and selfishness‚Äîidealism. **By ‚Äòidealism‚Äô we mean only the ability of the individual to sacrifice himself for the whole, for his fellow men.‚Äù**‚ÄîAdolf Hitler,[139] 1925...>‚ÄúTHE COMMON INTEREST BEFORE SELF-INTEREST.‚Äù‚ÄîNSDAP Program, Point 24, 1920...>‚ÄúWe must rouse in our people the unanimous wish for power in this sense, together with the determination to sacrifice on the altar of patriotism, not only life and property, but also private views and preferences in the interests of the common welfare.‚Äù‚ÄîFriedrich von Bernhardi,[142] 1912In political practice:Statism: >"a political system in which the state has substantial centralized control over social and economic affairs." or‚Ä¶ "The political expression of altruism is collectivism or statism, which holds that man‚Äôs life and work belong to the state‚Äîto society, to the group, the gang, the race, the nation‚Äîand that the state may dispose of him in any way it pleases for the sake of whatever it deems to be its own tribal, collective good."- Rand Regarding statism and eariler the issue of property rights...>‚Äú‚ÄòPrivate property‚Äô as conceived under the liberalistic economic order ‚Ä¶ represented the right of the individual to manage and to speculate with inherited or acquired property as he pleased, without regard for the general interests ‚Ä¶ German socialism had to overcome this ‚Äòprivate,‚Äô that is, unrestrained and irresponsible view of property. All property is common property. The owner is bound by the people and the Reich to the responsible management of his goods. His legal position is only justified when he satisfies this responsibility to the community.‚Äù‚ÄîErnst Rudolf Huber,[147] official Nazi Party spokesman, 1939 Pretty much 99% of Rubio's endorsements are establishment endorsements in a anti-establishment election.    If Romney came out to endorse Rubio I'd bet money it would hurt him more than it would help him. More context is exactly what makes it left wing, and the Left has worked very hard to make their 'say so' into the dictionaries. Back in the 1920s when fascism was a new political development, it was widely -- and correctly -- regarded as being on the political left. Jonah Goldberg's great book "Liberal Fascism" cites overwhelming evidence of the fascists' consistent pursuit of the goals of the left, and of the left's embrace of the fascists as one of their own during the 1920s. Mussolini, the originator of fascism, was lionized by the left, both in Europe and in America, during the 1920s. Even Hitler, who adopted fascist ideas in the 1920s, was seen by some, including W.E.B. Du Bois, as a man of the left.It was in the 1930s, when ugly internal and international actions by Hitler and Mussolini repelled the world, that the left distanced themselves from fascism and its Nazi offshoot -- and verbally transferred these totalitarian dictatorships to the right, saddling their opponents with these pariahs.Like I said, if you care to look, that all the essential components of Left-wing philosophy are held firmly in the heart of Fascism:  Collectivism, Self Sacrifice, and Statism.  The issue of Nationalism or internationalism falls under the Statism premise. It does so because the premise of a person in service to the state is the same, regardless of it's size. (Be it a county, a country, or the globe.)  It leaves out(on purpose), the premise of the state solely as a protector of individual rights.Now you might say that there is a difference in regard to property, but i'll ask you to check that premise. Fascism, far from having anything in common with capitalism, is essentially the same atrocity as communism and socialism‚Äîthe only difference being that whereas communism and socialism openly call for state ownership of all property, fascism holds that some property may be ‚Äúprivate‚Äù‚Äîso long as government can dictate how such property may be used. Sure, you own the factory, but here‚Äôs what you may and may not produce in it; here‚Äôs the minimum wage you must pay employees; here‚Äôs the kind of accounting system you must use; here are the specifications your machinery must meet; and so on.This is their Primary difference in theory. However, in practice and principle they are one and the same. "Both ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù(or communism) and ‚Äúfascism‚Äù involve the issue of property rights. Under socialism, there is collective ownership of property de jure. Under fascism, there is the same collective ownership de facto. The right to property is the right of use and disposal. Ownership without control is a contradiction in terms: it means ‚Äúproperty,‚Äù without the right to use it or to dispose of it. If a person does not have the right to dispose of his property, he does not have a right to property. In practice both ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù and ‚Äúfascism‚Äù take communal ownership of an individual's property.Without Collectivism, Altruism/Self Sacrifice, an all powerful state, and the abrogation of property rights-neither Socialism or Fascism could exist. They are ideological Left-wing brothers. Maybe you should head back to /r/sanders I can't find anything for the 31 point swing, but I hope you're right because that is awesome. No one running is Capitalist or Socialist....   They are all varying degrees of Fascist.    Cruz is the closest thing to a Capitalist we've got.If you care to look, that all the essential components of Left-wing philosophy are held firmly in the heart of Fascism: Collectivism, Self Sacrifice, and Statism.(Trump get's two of three, though if he were asked about eminent domain im sure he'd say it's for 'the greater good'.) The issue of Nationalism or internationalism falls under the Statism premise. It does so because the premise of a person in service to the state is the same, regardless of it's size. (Be it a county, a country, or the globe.) It leaves out(on purpose), the premise of the state solely as a protector of individual rights. That was poetry, thank you. http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ks/kansas_republican_presidential_caucus-4322.htmlhttp://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/la/louisiana_republican_presidential_primary-4074.htmlhttp://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ky/kentucky_republican_presidential_primary-3834.htmlMostly +10 across the board in a short amount of time.  I think the implication was that it would have been bigger minus the early voting.   From what I could read rather quickly, Phil Bryant seems to be rather popular there.  (66.4% win for Bryant in 2015)Combine that with the pro-Cruz trend from the last debate, Cruz's good ground game, Carson out of the race, Rubio's support tanking and the results from Super Saturday...   He just might pull it off.    Granted, a 25 point turn around looks crazy(Kansas and Maine were 10-15 point turn arounds), but if he pulls it off...  wow... I have a feeling tomorrow is going to be a good day to be a Cruz supporter.  This a key endorsement in a state that will have a close margin in the polls tomorrow.  Huge win for Cruz.>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for Republicans to join together and unite the party for the good of our state and our nation,‚Äù said Gov. Bryant. ‚ÄúI urge my fellow Mississippians to join me in standing behind Ted Cruz tomorrow.‚Äù Really?  Sweet! lol. Should I read the ending of Atlas Shrugged?   That's it?    That's your defense?That's like a stick of wood in the sand trying to hold back a tide of evidence. The speaker, and no one here likes Bush/Romney.Your straw man stinks. Coming in for the (3/4)closed Republican primaries on March 8. Polls show Trump collapsing Idaho and Hawaii, while Cruz is gaining ground fast. Michigan is solidly Trump, however Cruz might place a closer second now. Mississippi will be close, but if the large base of Carson supporters move to the Cruz camp, Cruz will win. All of these states are Proportional with delegates.The next debate is MARCH 10, 2016 Miami, FloridaMy prediction is that Cruz will win Idaho, Hawaii, and Mississippi(by a narrow margin). Trump will win Michigan.At the debate there will be more fireworks between Rubio and Trump. Trump will tell him his poll numbers suck and he should drop out, Rubio will tell him that Clinton is killing Trump in the latest polls and that he should drop out.The Flordia polls get split 3 ways with Trump 32%, Rubio 30%, and Cruz 28%...   Trump wins the nomination.Hillary, the most hated politician in the country(next to Trump), wins the election and drags our country further into the crapper.The GOP is forever stained as the racist/bigot/fascist/nationalist party instead of principles, freedom, and individual rights... A new generation of socialists feel even more morally superior.  America dies.Trump and Hillary high five each other. Polls show both Trump and Rubio tanking in Hawaii.     Like LA, they probably have the better share of early voting.   No, Dr. Yaron Brook is the speaker.>I've not listened to the podcast(Its 3 minutes long) Well, had you listened, the speaker does mention the anti-PC/anti-establishment support.   Please return back to /r/The_Donald where they accept those kind of thoughtless responses. Exactly, you're helping the case that, "Yes, the American population has become more dumbed down." Your sentence doesn't help your case any. You're right, and I would say a Constitutional social conservative is less a threat than someone like Huckebee or Santoum who obviously don't give a damn about the Constitution and are fiscal moderates at best.   Actually the same polls show otherwise.   As well as his win in Maine, that Cruz was able to win there proves he has moved beyond a small evangelical base. It's not hard to figure out why the above would be true.   The whole nation in polarized against trump, including me and the majority of the Republican party.   I wouldn't expect anything less from some moron member of /r/socialism who thinks capitalism promotes racism.   Hillary is already beating trump decisively.  http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2016/clinton_edges_ahead_of_trump_in_presidential_matchup?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=DailyNewsletterIf Trump supporters throw the election it's their fault, not ours. Lot of Trump supporters trying to bury this info. Ditto You are correct. The issue of Nationalism or internationalism falls under the Statism premise. It does so because the premise of a person in service to the state is the same, regardless of it's size. (Be it a county, a country, or the globe.) It leaves out(on purpose), the premise of the state solely as a protector of individual rights. I do.  But there is also really not much Cruz can do about it.  Even if he does appoint someone to the Supreme court that agrees with his view on marriage(that it should be a state issue, a position I disagree with), they are not going to reverse anything.I think he knows this but still has advocate against the ruling for political support in the primary.   That's why he's mentioned it's not going to be a priority for him(see below), because it's pretty much a done issue.http://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/ted-cruz-gay-marriage-secret-audio-217090 That is true, some of those I wish did not exist, like tax benefits.My point is that the state's only role is acknowledging the contract between two individuals, no matter the particulars of the contract.  (With the exception of a contract that proposed to violate another person's rights.   (Like a hit-man contract or such)) No, but it's an issue that is pretty much closed, and Cruz has hinted that he doesn't care to pursuit the issue.My position is that marriage is a religious institution, and outside of the state acknowledging a contract for shared property, the state should butt out.It is as much of a violation of religious freedom for a church in California to force a church nextdoor or in Georgia to marry a gay couple as it is for a church in Georgia to do the same in preventing a church nextdoor from marrying a gay couple. I literally 'laughed out loud' at this.   You're right. He was my first pick, though I didn't agree with everything he said either.    I am much stronger on the military and stronger against Islamic Jihad than Rand Paul is.    I don't think he was as bad as his father in this regard, but I don't think he is effective as someone needs to be.   That said, he is an outstanding senator.   Note that the Left attacks Cruz by means of calling attention to folks like his father, and saying that Cruz only has evangelical support. The 'melting pot' that leftists pretend to care about so much is a consequence of the political equality the Constitution and principle of individual rights creates.It's Europe that was known for it's balkanization, for its racial and ideological pressure groups that bashed each other over the head with government power.   What made America a melting pot was political freedom.   No more did, English, French, Germans, Italians, Dutch, Catholics, Protestants, Atheists, Jews, etc have to worry about some other 'group' legally harming them.   For the first time, each had a self interested reason to deal with one another, to work, to trade, to profit together, or leave each other alone.     Cruz is much different than those like Huckebee. This is why Ted Cruz is the only anti-Trump option, because Cruz is also anti-establishment. The evangelicals have been voting more for trump than anyone. I'm not saying there are not good evangelicals, but as a whole I don't think they can be trusted.And there are really weird mixes, like Glenn Beck.  He's a conservative, but has a little libertarian and evangelical in him.      Pretty much.Both groups are Christians, however what separates the two is which group puts which foot forward.Conservatives put their ideological foot forward.Evangelicals put their religious foot forward.However, in the world of politics, this amounts to evangelicals putting what they 'feel' forward.    This is why political values have taken a backseat for evangelicals in this election.   This is why they are coming out so hard for Trump.It shows up in policy too... Huckebee, Rick Santorum, Billy Graham...     I'm from Arkansas, when Huckebee was governor he expanded government more than the Dems ever did.      I've NEVER trusted the evangelicals, and their support for Trump is going right to my theory.   Same here.   If Trump wins the nomination, I'll vote for Gary Johnson as a protest vote. That's what I would do. Conservatives and Evangelicals are NOT the same thing.   They might have the same values, however they think and act quite differently.  A good comparison: Ted Cruz is a conservative.   Ted Cruz's father is an evangelical.Mark Levin = Conservative.     Huckebee = EvangelicalThomas Sowell = Conservative...     Billy Graham = EvangelicalBen Carson = Conservative...     The Robertson Family (Duck Dynasty) = Evangelical. Conservatives are more ideological.    Evangelicals are more emotional.Conservatives are more like the old roman republic pagans. Their virtues were their values, adopted intrinsically. They knew and felt what it meant to be a good roman.   While Evangelicals are much more like their early christian counterparts in the late roman empire.This is why the Conservatives have come out for Cruz, and the evangelicals have come out for Trump. Hubris...   Black democrats have the same psychology as Trump supporters.They are anti-political philosophy and like demagogues. Some of my conservative friends, have wondered in amazement how in the world the evangelicals are coming out to vote for Trump instead of Cruz.   It's the same principle. Christian Conservatives have a lot of common sense and are very ideological, but evangelicals are as gullible as they come. These are the kind of people that have never known an independent thought in their life, and are constantly moved with feverish emotion by some demagogue behind a pulpit.   Is it any wonder why they have come out in force for a demagogue like Trump while ignoring the similarly valued, principled man such as Ted Cruz.Evangelicals don't respond to values like Conservatives do. Evangelicals respond to pure feeling.Same thing for Black Dems...  have you seen some of those crazy mystical black churches? http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/23/u-s-religious-groups-and-their-political-leanings/the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church (+88 Dem)    See^ They(The Cruz campaign) re-tweeted a CNN tweet about Ben Carson dropping out; the misinformation came from them(CNN). You're the liar Trump.   I think Trump and Cruz got Rubio's cold.   Not much, I was a Paul supporter who now supports Cruz.   Pretty much all Paul supporters made up their mind to either Support Cruz or not vote when he dropped out.  In fact, Ironically...  I know some Paul supporters that weren't going to come out until Trump attacked Paul's Kentucky run today.   Such a stupid ass move from Trump.   Honestly, I think all the Republicans can beat Hillary.  She should be in jail. She's being investigated by the FBI.   She's a Clinton.  Half the Dems hate her.    4% difference now.  Holy crap.   Cruz closing the gap in KY.   6% Difference now.   Sounds like Ted Cruz caught Rubio's cold.   lol...  Clinton talking about 'china' now.   Maybe Trump can jump over to the Democratic party where he belongs. WP just called LA for trump.    Eh.   To their credit, it's been getting better the last few years.   However the damage has been done over the last 20 years. That's actually something I'm looking for to figure out if my theory is true.   In fact if I were Cruz I'd tell my supporters in Florida to vote for Rubio.   I think it was on purpose. I think Cruz and Rubio have a unwritten agreement now. Rubio will roll in the mud with Trump and keep them both looking bad while Cruz shines about the rest. Cant get your principles out there if you lose an election because of the Trump supporters.

First, wealth has to be CREATED before it's redistributed.   Second, those who pay morons large sums of money for non-work go out of business.     Go fuck yourself and your bullshit assumed premises.     >Large trusts and corporations can beat out smaller competition such as local businesses because of their ability to produce goods and services at a much lower cost.So?  Oh man, I had the opposite of this.I grew up upper middle class and was pampered by my parents to the point where I was useless.  This question assumes that large corporations are a bad thing. > They(The Cruz campaign) re-tweeted a CNN tweet; the misinformation came from them(CNN)Not the Cruz campaign.This is why you're being downvoted.   You didn't have a clue of what you were talking about. Not until after Florida. I've been seeing how Trump supporters stack internet polls like Ron Paul's supporters used to. (I used to be a Paul supporter) So I really question the accuracy of that poll. I've been seeing how Trump supporter stack internet polls like Ron Paul's supporters used to.  (I used to be a Paul supporter)   So I really question the accuracy of that poll. Arkansan here, Yep. I liked you in that awesome book you were in.   I agree with that statement too, in fact I consider it our oil(the wests oil) that they nationalized in the first place.However I do not believe Trump at all when he says this.He's a pragmatist, he says contradictory statements, and comprises on all issues. I agree with both of those points, and even think you went too easy on #1, I consider the rules of engagement set forth by the Bush administration tantamount to treason.   As for#2, I'm an odd duck.   I think we should decommission most forward bases and pull out of most areas.   At the same time I consider the countless actions of Iran for the last 40 years, each, acts of war, and that we should of leveled that country long ago.    Leveled all government and military installations, leveled every mosque(at peek operating hours), and so on until the only thing left standing are the secular groups and buildings in Iran.   No troops sent in, just destruction.      Then turn to Saudi Arabia(who I do not consider an Ally), and say "If you do not eliminate all elements of terrorist support and Wahabi extremism from your country, we will do to you, what we just did to Iran."So for the most part I agree with you, but how in the world do you see Trump as a supporter of that? Create your own party and take the neo cons with you. Good god, I read that in perfect Trumpspeak... >"They're going to do what I tell them." I think Trump has lost the military vote in this debate.    I was insulted on behalf of all my military friends and family.    For those who were confused by Cruz's oddly specific closing statements regarding having the backs of military personnel and such....Think back to the question Trump was asked about the military disobeying his unlawful orders.---------Meagan: It appears you are inconsistent.Trump: I'm not inconsistent.Meagan: But we have proof.Trump: You need to be flexible.  I can make a deal.Dear Trump:>"A compromise is an adjustment of conflicting claims by mutual concessions. This means that both parties to a compromise have some valid claim and some value to offer each other. And this means that both parties agree upon some fundamental principle which serves as a base for their deal.""There can be no compromise between a property owner and a burglar; offering the burglar a single teaspoon of one‚Äôs silverware would not be a compromise, but a total surrender‚Äîthe recognition of his right to one‚Äôs property." - Ayn RandWhat I love is that Cruz basically said this as a rebuttal.  There can be NO COMPROMISE on basic principles.    No deal, Mr Trump.----------------On a side note, Marco should just take over The Late Show with all these hilarious jokes he's got.>Trump interrupts*>"Breathe Donald" -Cruz>"When you're done with your yoga, I have something to say" -Rubio>"I hope we don't see yoga on this stage" -Cruz>"Well, Trump is very flexible" -Rubio If he doesn't get enough delegates to win on the first vote, he failed to win the nomination. Yeah, I don't know much about Cruz's law career, but that tells me he must be/have been a damn good lawyer.   I think Cruz knew Trump had fucked up with his military answer and made sure to press the point home in his closing statements.    >"They're going to do what I tell them."

"They're going to do what I tell them." I think Trump has lost the military vote in this debate. If you don't have principles, you can be consistent.   The establishment is made up of Neocons and Moderates. 100% off topic.  This has nothing to do with Atheism.  I signed no such pledge. I won't vote Hillary, but this republican will vote libertarian in trump gets the nomination. As for the personal explanation of how it would be, I defer to A quote from Atlas Shrugged:>‚ÄúThen this country will once more become a sanctuary for a vanishing species: the rational being. The political system we will build is contained in a single moral premise: no man may obtain any values from others by resorting to physical force. Every man will stand or fall, live or die by his rational judgment. If he fails to use it and falls, he will be his only victim. If he fears that his judgment is inadequate, he will not be given a gun to improve it. If he chooses to correct his errors in time, he will have the unobstructed example of his betters, for guidance in learning to think; but an end will be put to the infamy of paying with one life for the errors of another.‚ÄúIn that world, you‚Äôll be able to rise in the morning with the spirit you have known in your childhood: that spirit of eagerness, adventure and certainty which comes from dealing with a rational universe. No child is afraid of nature; it is your fear of men that will vanish, the fear that has stunted your soul, the fear you acquired in your early encounters with the incomprehensible, the unpredictable, the contradictory, the arbitrary, the hidden, the faked, the irrational in men. You will live in a world of responsible beings, who will be as consistent and reliable as facts; the guarantee of their character will be a system of existence where objective reality is the standard of the judge. Your virtues will be given protection, your vices and weaknesses will not. Every chance will be open to your good, none will be provided for your evil. What you‚Äôll receive from men will not be alms, or pity, or mercy, or forgiveness of sins, but a single value: justice. And when you‚Äôll look at men or at yourself, you will feel, not disgust, suspicion and guilt, but a single constant: respect. That's an impossible question to ask for a capitalist.200 years ago what exists today would be unfathomable to those back then.   All it took was 200 years of 70-80% capitalism to turn a poor starving world into what we see today.I can only imagine that 200 years of pure Capitalism and we would be living in Star Trek, minus the aliens and space travel. Arkansas here.  I know all the Carson supporters in my local republican meetup and more than half have Cruz as their second.   So it's a fair assumption. My worst nightmare. We are angry.  Anything that helps Trump makes us more angry.  Technically he's a racial bigot.  For him to be racist he would have to believe black people are superior to white people...   And...  Who believes that? They are, but I'm speaking to the content itself.>This was a very good book and an added bonus was that it was free on Amazon app store. Definitely recommended.Is not a very good review, even if it is 5star. I actually don't think this is a bad idea, as long as the polls in that particular state show a strong Hillary lead.    For example, 'Arkansas', everyone knew she was going to win that in a landslide.   So the best way for a liberal to make their vote count in the primary is use it to block Trump's nomination. If we don't, Trump will be the nominee.   I'm starting to think that Trump is getting so bad that the effects him winning the presidency might have on the party might actually be worse.It's one of those: Lose the battle, or lose the war. #NeverTrump  ROFL....To be fair, I never really liked any of those people to begin with.   Sweet.   Nice to know you would potentially vote for me.   I am an Atheist and as Right wing and moralistic as you can go.  I don't hold any punches when it comes to Islam though.  I've always HATED the Establishment(centrist/neocon) republicans...   However, now I find myself in the position of thinking that even they are not as bad as the direction we are going with Trump. Anyone that thinks a republican will lose to the Criminal Clinton is crazy.We could nominate a turd and beat the Dems, the sad fact is, it looks like we are. 100% right there with you. What's the point of winning if you lose all the things you care about? Probably the Libertarian candidate. Unfortunately, Nothing in it is satire, go fuck yourself. I agree we've been eating shit for a long time, but eating cyanide is not the answer. And if I believed a word of that, I would be right there behind you....However, Trump is a pragmatist(like Hillary).   On the issues he doesn't totally compromise on, he had the opposite view the day before.He's a pragmatic, untrustworthy, man-child who is campaigning on a cult of personality.   He's a uniter /u/supersammy00   He's going to pickup the phone.   He knows a guy.   He's going to unite us.  Republicans, Democrats together.   We're going to become great again.   It's going to be great.  They prepared so well for this skit.    As a Republican who HATES Trump, I too want to make Donald Drumpf again! I don't. The formatting is pulled from the paper you stupid fuck.Monckton's argument the (4a) No position and (4b) UncertainMine involves the endorsement (1) & (2)Either you're trying to play me for a fool, or your playing yourself as one.You'd know that if you actually looked at the argument and the paper rather than rushing for some link to justify your faith! No, I've never heard of Monckton on "Watts Up With That".   All you are doing is copying someone else's argument against someone else's debate.  I read the damn paper.   >You can‚Äôt compare papers that state no position on global warming with those that do.This is the crux of the debunk, however this is not my argument at all.  My argument is a semantic one, and that it maters in the context of what is being claimed.‚Äúexplicit endorsement with quantification‚Äù is representative of a paper that states that: "Explicitly states that humans are the primary cause of recent global warming"‚Äîprimary cause in usage meaning more than 50 percent.   This is pulled from Cook's own fucking paper.  Table FUCKing Two.Look, I made you a picture of it: Explicitly states that humans are the primary cause of recent global warming http://imgur.com/bKaqGYXquantified (e.g., humans are contributing more than 50% of global warming:http://imgur.com/kf4jm1iAGW by definition is ONLY Level 1 = "Explicit endorsement with quantification."Even MY position falls into level 2 =  Explicit endorsement without quantification e.g., humans contribute SOME indeterminate amount to global warming.However, level two DOES NOT fit the definition of AGW which REQUIRES that human beings are the PRIMARY cause.  Primary, as defined by both Cook and IPCC as 50+%.  Therefore to say that 97% of papers support AGW is a 100% OUTRIGHT LIE.  -----------------How do you not understand that by me saying, "The climate has been warming, and human beings have **some** effect on it warming" (<< Which is my position), that it is NOT an endorsement of AGW, and that statement is categorized in cook's paper with support for AGW. Do you forfeit Cook et. al. or not?    It's a yes or no question. I'm not ignoring them, I EXPLICITLY said I would get to those other subjects AFTER we were finished with the first.I am not going to let you change the subject...Either you capitulate and admit that I'm right on this issue, or you argue that Cook proves a 97% endorsement of AGW.  Not an argument.   And I literally said I would address your points once you've addressed mine, since you refuse, you forfeit.  Even I fall into their 2nd category for "Explicit endorsement without quantification".  The fact is only 64 papers endorsed AGW.   You refuse to accept that.  So don't talk to me about "pre-formed conclusions". I just keep a very low balance at all times(not enough to matter in terms of interest), and autopay on that.    I assume that works the same way?    lol, yeah I was ticked off when I wrote it and didn't bother to spell/grammar check everything.  Also, to be honest I've got some horrible grammar habits.  (I'm soon going to be taking a refresher class on grammar.)>It's frustrating to me that so many people have pre-formulated opinions on rand without having read any of her works.  Well, most Objectivists consider that an epistemological habit acquired through progressive schooling.   Many teachers today treat a child's views and opinions as sacred, and often call on them to voice their views without having the knowledge and evidence to back them up.  Not only that, but the hip trend in schools today is the "bull session" where the teacher becomes one of the students and they go around the room expressing their opinions.   These methods promote subjectivism and a "anything goes" egalitarian attitude.  "We have to respect everyone's opinions."   Which in practice means that we must respect the unsupported, the foolish, and the evil.   Then there are all of the attack articles put out by places like Salon.com  In all honesty, all the Objectivists I know get a good laugh out of them, and actually are happy that so many try to slander Rand.    Why?    Because we know that if a person who reads one of those attack articles is honest, and reads Rand's actual views...   Well, they'll know which side is honest and which side is not.   They might not totally agree with Rand's philosophy(I didn't at first), but they will distrust her opponents from then on out. The hell it is, Cook et. al. is the #1 cited source for scientific consensus.  From John Oliver's Last Week Tonight, to Bernie Sanders, to John Kerry, to Obama, to the thousands of articles published, even NASA(which you just cite) has Cook et. al. as its first citation on it's consensus page:>J. Cook, et al, "Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature," Environmental Research Letters Vol. 8 No. 2, (June 2013); DOI:10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024Of course I provided evidence against Cook et. al.   Read it again.   It's important to note that nearly ALL climate skeptic believe that the earth has been warming and that human beings have *SOME* effect on climate change, but are not the primary cause (in usage meaning more than 50 percent.)(anthropogenic)   Cook, et al however includes all of those under "Explicit endorsement with quantification." to make up his 97%, when in reality ONLY 64 papers made the cut.>you haven't addressed the issue, i.e. Anthropogenic Climate Change in any wayAnd of course we've not discussed the science behind Anthropogenic Climate Change, to do so PROPERLY would require more written than exists in this entire sub.   Just the matter of Consensus will take up many pages of writing, and I doubt you will concede it.    Further, the issue of consensus is most important because it is the weapon that is being used against those who have not scientific understanding and are asked to take this issue ON FAITH.So, if you concede that  Cook, et al is a a load of garbage, then I will address the points on consensus that you've addressed, if you don't concede, then we stick to Cook, et al. I really need to go to bed, but I had this all ready to go, and i'm still up, so...Yes, the source of this claim is cited from "Cook et al. (2013).  However, it did not find that "over 97% endorsed the view that the Earth is warming up and human emissions of greenhouse gases are the main cause."Quoting from the Abstract, >"Among abstracts expressing a position on AGW, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming.

(2013), we can observe the paper broken down as follows:(1) Explicit endorsement with quantification.(2) Explicit endorsement without quantification(3) Implicit endorsement(4a) No position(4b) Uncertain(5) Implicit rejection(6) Explicit rejection without quantification(7) Explicit rejection with quantification ‚Äúexplicit endorsement with quantification‚Äù is representative of a paper that states that: "Explicitly states that humans are the primary cause of recent global warming"‚Äîprimary cause in usage meaning more than 50 percent.  This is the only category anyone claiming "X number of papers endorse Man Made Climate Change." should reference, because this is the only category where that statement is true. ‚Äúexplicit endorsement without quantification‚Äù  are papers in which the author, by Cook‚Äôs admission, did not say whether .001 percent or 1 percent or 50 percent or 100 percent of the warming was caused by man. The crux of "explicit endorsement without quantification" is that man has contributed SOME amount.Then there is "Implicit endorsement", which "Implies humans are causing global warming. E.g., research assumes greenhouse gas emissions cause warming without explicitly stating humans are the cause".The important distinction here is that neither the ‚Äúexplicit endorsement without quantification‚Äù  or the "Implicit endorsement" make the claim that Human beings are the primary cause. However the theory of AGW([Anthropogenic, or human-cause, Global Warming) is that human being ARE the PRIMARY cause.However within his results he breaks down the summery of abstracts with AGW([Anthropogenic, or human-cause, Global Warming) position (%) as follows:Endorse AGW 97.1%Reject AGW 1.9%Uncertain on AGW 1.0%In formulating his result of "Endorse AGW", Cook lumps together "Implicit endorsement" & ‚Äúexplicit endorsement without quantification‚Äù  with  ‚Äúexplicit endorsement with quantification‚Äù. Thus lumping together papers which suggest that human contribute some portion, with those stating that we are the primary cause.Further examination of Cooks data http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/2/024024/media/erl460291datafile.txt shows the truth of the matter:By his count, the number of articles classified into each category was:Level 1 = 64Level 2 = 922Level 3 = 2910Level 4 = 7970Level 5 = 54Level 6 = 15Level 7 = 9The 97% figure was the sum of levels 1-3. Assuming the count is correct‚Äîthat 97% breaks down as:Level 1: 1.6%Level 2: 23%Level 3: 72%This shows only 1.6 percent explicitly stated that man-made greenhouse gases caused at least 50 percent of global warming. Only Level 1 corresponds to "the Earth is warming up and human emissions of greenhouse gases are the main cause."    Hence when John Cook attributed that view to 97% on the basis of his Cook et. al. (2013) he was misrepresenting 1.6% as 97%. So no, Cook et. al. did not find that "over 97% endorsed the view that the Earth is warming up and human emissions of greenhouse gases are the main cause."------------------------------------------------------Not only does Cook's own data not prove the case, but I have proof that much of cook's data is improperly categorized, and many scientists have come out against the clarification of their papers in pro AGW categories.It's bad enough that this 97% statistic is false, what's worse is that those who advocate that AGW exists try to browbeat people into believing in by using an illogical standard in the first place.  Even if we are to dismiss this appeal to authority, and IF this paper were actually true, it certainly does not excuse that fact that it's not even cited property the majority of the time- That people say 97% of scientists, or climate scientists, when the subject was actually peer reviewed papers.   The whole thing is one big fucking joke.This is one of the many reason I'm skeptical about AGW...    And if what I said above is correct, it's a very valid reason.Ok, now im going to bed. I will say real quick, that I know the definition and my question was directed to what the "consensus" is in relation to anthropogenic climate change. Actually I didn't know about the Petition Project.It's 3:30 am here and I'm going to bed.   I'll respond to this in the morning, pm me if I forget. I will tomorrow, it's 3:30 am here.  Pm me if I forget. To answer this would require an entire book on the subject.   However to answer as quickly as possible(im heading to bed), I would say that inductive generalizations from valid concretes are the basis of all scientific knowledge, and that you must have an objective criteria for proof in scientific theory.    The steps taken by those like Galileo, Newton, Kepler,  and Copernicus are much different than those of many scientists today. No, I have evidence and reasons to disagree with the IPCC and the current cultural attitudes and beliefs.I'm perfectly willing to listen to evidence and argue with someone who is honest, and doesn't try to browbeat me into believing in something.   That however, rarely if ever happens on this subject.Take a single issue: scientific consensusWhat do you think it is, and what do you think it means? Permalink my post and just see how many Rational responses I get and you'll see what I mean.  ;) The argument of the first comment is using my self as evidence that directly contradicts the OP's statements."People are only skeptics for religious or profit related reasons!"  I'm an Atheist and have nothing to profit from my position, therefore, I by nature of my existence proves the OPs statement incorrect.  Do try to keep up. I'm not stubbern, i'm perfectly willing to listen to evidence and argue with someone who is honest, and doesn't try to browbeat me into believing in something.   I'll be honest, if 99% of those who do believe in believe in anthropogenic climate change, acted like you do...  I would be less skeptical.  However, permalink my OP and just see how many rational responses I get.  ;) Ok, lets take a single issue: scientific consensus  What do you think it is, and what do you think it means? If you consider that a rational argument, then you don't care for a rational argument or know what one looks like.That, I might add, is one of the reasons I began to suspect the integrity of CC advocates in the first place.  That's not an argument.  No, I have evidence and reasons to disagree with the IPCC and the current cultural attitudes and beliefs. This has been made worse by a corruption in science philosophy, the basic scientific method, and government grants. This is NOT related to Atheism.   Mods, quit being biased pussies. I'm an Atheist, don't work in the oil industry and i'm a huge Climate Skeptic.  I'd give my reasons why, but lets be honest... what's the point? I blame Oprah.  She is the worst, she made it possible. Sleazy mystical nutbag, Leftist, racist, and promoter of quackery. She has been a platform for the crazy ideas of Jenny McCarthy, Dr. Oz, Obama, Deepak Chopra, and The Secret. She's also responsible for Dr. Phil. She's basically everything wrong with our country wrapped up into an overweight black woman. The first book I read was Anthem , which is a short 2H read. Then, in all honesty, I cheated and read the 'big speech'(3H) at the end of Atlas Shrugged before I read the book itself.    It was a pretty big spoiler, but for me who didn't read much at the time, it gave me the motivation to read further.  "We the Living" was the 3rd book I read.  It's kinda like an autobiographical fiction of what life was like in the USSR. It was dark and depressing, but what else is there to expect from a life in Soviet Russia.>Unfortunately Rand has quite a dismal following on reddit, even in /r/books. You're wasting your time even trying in /r/liberal...Well, my direct purpose was to get back at /u/legowhore.   He posted this in one of my subs, I refuted it, he talked trash and continued to post it elsewhere... Soo... I just copied it over.      To my shock a few people responded favorably to it.    I had one guy in /r/philosophy tell me that my post completely changed his view of Rand.   So that was pretty cool. Guilty of anti-social leanings comrade?  TO THE GULAG!Any idea how many times Leftists have called me and other Objectivists, sociopaths or psychopaths?   >If Uber was illegal where you are, they probably wouldn't have the service in your city..."If pot was illegal where you are, they probably wouldn't have pot in your city."   "If a gun was illegal where you are, they probably wouldn't have guns in your city."   Do you have any idea how many different taxes and regulations there are? Easy, I would auction off ALL government land  (Schools, roads, forests, etc)   Whatever was left over would be saved an a secure emergency military fund.I would end ALL government programs with the exception of the Police, and the court system.I would eliminate all law that does not serve the purpose of protecting a person's right to Life, liberty, and Property.  I would from that point on, finance the courts/police levy strictly on government enforced contracts.I would put forth a new Constitution and system of checks and balances to ensure it did not change.  I would then resign as dictator of Mississippi, sit back, and watch as every business and drop of capital comes pouring into the state. Granted i've got a cold today, but that was very difficult to read.If the issue at hand was truly cronyism, then we would be talking about cronyism, not the wishy washy concept of "Income inequality".   I disagree with that.The only people that justifiably should be helped are those who are suffering of no fault of their own.   That's about 1/1000th of the population.  The rest, deserve to suffer.   When I was homeless, I deserved it.Not only was it a choice due to previous bad choices, I had the option of being "Supported" like I had my entire life and not being homeless.It was only until I forced myself to suffer the consequences of my actions instead of unloading that burden on others that I changed my life around for the better.Altruistic assholes like Bernie don't care if what they do ACTUALLY helps, all they care about is the feeling of helping others.He uses the example of hungry kids and homeless vets because we all can agree that they are less/not responsible for their lot.  Homeless vets make up .01% of the population, and I assure you if you spent $200,000 per vet to help them out, 2/3 of them would be back on the streets in a year.As for the hungry kids...   Good luck finding an accurate statistic.    NO child in the USA starves because of means, anyone can figure out that with a $10 bill and a walk to walmart, the only ones that have actual starvation issues are from parental neglect.   This is why when you look this up you see all these bullshit subjective terms flying around like "food-insecurity" in order to artificially inflate percentages.  It's all one big fucking scam. Are you fucking kidding me? Seriously. 1. This has nothing to do with atheism.2. As someone who's been homeless, fuck Bernie, and fuck everything he said.  Bring on the downvotes bitches! As a funny aside, I had a Bernie supporter tell me today: "No one wants to equalize the wealth distribution in this country. Only to balance things out..... "lol >The issue of wealth and income inequality is the great moral issue of our time, it is the great economic issue of our time, and it is the great political issue of our time.  - Bernie Sanders>There is something profoundly wrong when the top one-tenth of one percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.  - Bernie SandersThe entire argument made around "income Inequality" is a moral issue.   Not only is it made a moral issue, it's painted as this intrinsic evil "Oh, isn't it so wrong that so few have so much, while so many have so little."   Those advocates use that intrinsic nature as a magic wand they then attach to and economic issues within the country.   They have to argue on principle why "inequality" is not an intrinsic evil first.Then separate the real pain issues out of the inequality debate and connect them to government intervention.To quote from the popular article that inspired all of this:>Is Economic Inequality Unfair? So if economic inequality necessarily emerges from political equality, is that fair? To answer that question we need to start by realizing that the inequality alarmists have tried to smuggle into the discussion a perspective on wealth that tacitly assumes that economic inequality is unjust. The ‚Äúfixed pie‚Äù assumption. The alarmists often speak of economic success as if it were a fixedsum game. There is only so much wealth to go around, and so inequality amounts to proof that someone has gained at someone else‚Äôs expense. Arguing that ‚Äúthe riches accruing to the top have come at the expense of those down below,‚Äù Stiglitz writes:>"One can think of what‚Äôs been happening in terms of slices of a pie. If the pie were equally divided, everyone would get a slice of the same size, so the top 1 percent would get 1 percent of the pie. In fact, they get a very big slice, about a fifth of the entire pie. But that means everyone gets a smaller slice. 6 ">What this ignores is the fact of production. If the pie is constantly expanding, because people are constantly creating more wealth, then one person‚Äôs gain doesn‚Äôt have to come at anyone else‚Äôs expense. That doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt get richer at other people‚Äôs expense, say by stealing someone else‚Äôs pie, but a rise in inequality per se doesn‚Äôt give us any reason to suspect that someone has been robbed or exploited or is even worse off.>Inequality, we have to keep in mind, is not the same thing as poverty. When people like journalist Timothy Noah complain that ‚Äúincome distribution in the United States is now more unequal than in Uruguay, Nicaragua, Guyana, and Venezuela,‚Äù they act as if it‚Äôs irrelevant that almost all Americans are rich compared to the citizens of these other countries. Economic inequality is perfectly compatible with widespread affluence, and rising inequality is perfectly compatible with a society in which the vast majority of citizens are getting richer. If the incomes of the poorest Americans doubled while the incomes of the richest Americans tripled, that would dramatically increase inequality even though every single person would be better off. Inequality refers not to deprivation but difference, and there is nothing suspicious or objectionable about differences per se.The ‚Äúgroup pie‚Äù assumption.>In a famous speech denouncing economic inequality, President Obama said, ‚ÄúThe top 10 percent no longer takes in one-third of our income‚Äîit now takes half.‚Äù 7 (Emphasis added.) This sort of phraseology, which is endemic in discussions of inequality, assumes that wealth is, in effect, a social pie that is created by ‚Äúsociety as a whole,‚Äù which then has to be divided up fairly. What‚Äôs fair? Economists Robert Frank and Philip Cook start off their book on inequality with a simple thought experiment. ‚ÄúImagine that you and two friends have been told that an anonymous benefactor has donated three hundred thousand dollars to divide among you. How would you split it? If you are like most people, you would immediately propose an equal division‚Äîone hundred thousand dollars per person.‚Äù8 If the pie belongs to ‚Äúall of us,‚Äù then absent other considerations, fairness demands we divide it up equally‚Äînot allow a small group to arbitrarily ‚Äútake‚Äù a third of ‚Äúour‚Äù income. But although we can speak loosely about how much wealth a society has, wealth is not actually a pie belonging to the nation as a whole. It consists of particular values created by particular individuals (often working together in groups) and belonging to particular individuals. It is not distributed by ‚Äúsociety‚Äù: it is produced and traded by the people who create it. To distribute it, ‚Äúsociety‚Äù would first have to seize it from the people who created it. This changes the equation dramatically. When individuals create something, there is no presumption that they should end up with equal shares. If Robinson Crusoe and Friday are on an island, and Crusoe grows seven pumpkins and Friday grows three pumpkins, Crusoe hasn‚Äôt grabbed a bigger piece of (pumpkin?) pie. He has simply created more wealth than Friday, leaving Friday no worse off. It is dishonest to say Crusoe has ‚Äútaken‚Äù 70 percent of ‚Äúthe island‚Äôs‚Äù wealth. >It‚Äôs obvious why these two assumptions about wealth would lead us to view economic inequality with a skeptical eye. If wealth is a fixed pie or a pie cooked up by ‚Äúsociety as a whole,‚Äù then it follows that economic equality is the ideal, and departures from this ideal are prima facie unjust. But if wealth is something that individuals create, then there‚Äôs no reason to expect that we should be anything close to equal economically. If we look at the actual individuals who make up society, it is self-evident that human beings are unequal in almost every respect: in size, strength, intelligence, beauty, frugality, ambition, work ethic, moral character. Those differences will necessarily entail huge differences in economic condition‚Äîand there is no reason why those differences should be viewed with skepticism, let alone alarm. If we keep in mind that wealth is something individuals produce, then there is no reason to think that economic equality is an ideal or even that economic inequality is something that requires a special justification. On the contrary, it is an inevitable byproduct of the ideal of political equality. But as the above analysis suggests, differences in productive achievement aren‚Äôt the only source of economic inequality. Economic inequality can result from injustices. To think clearly about inequality, we have to be able to distinguish between the earned and the unearned. What does it mean to say that someone ‚Äúearned‚Äù his income? In short, that he produced it. If Robinson Crusoe builds a spear and uses it to catch a fish, he earned that fish‚Äîhe produced it, it belongs to him, and it would be wrong for Friday to come along and take it. By the same token, we can earn values indirectly, by trading what we produce for the things that others produce. If Crusoe chooses not to eat his fish, but exchanges it with Friday for a coconut Friday chopped down from a tree, then Crusoe earned that coconut by obtaining it through the voluntary consent of Friday in a value-for-value trade.>In a division of labor economy, the principleis the same, but its application is less obvious. Wedon‚Äôt produce and trade concrete items like fish andcoconuts, as people do in barter economies. Instead,we produce in exchange for money, and we exchangemoney for the things that others produce. Whatdetermines how much money we receive for ourproductive efforts, and what we are able to buy withthat money? The voluntary consent of the people weexchange with. To earn something, in a division of laborcontext, is to acquire it through production andvoluntary exchange. What we merit is the economicvalue we create, as judged by the people who voluntarilytransact with us.  > was hardcore into Objectivism for like, 5 years.>I am also a pretty compassionate guy. .>Because of all that I've come to realize that I no longer, or never did, believe selfishness is a virtue.This is a great example to everyone here: this perpetual cultural myth that selflessness = compassion, and selfishness = apathy or worse.  I'm often help out my friends, family, and people who I believe deserve it.    My help is a a payment to their value.   It's selfish.   Compassion that would not be selfish is if I were to waste my money/time on people that:* Had no value / were self destructive.* Wanted to harm my life or values* Were evil.  >Also an unregulated economy will end up in a state where all the wealth is concentrated with a few people/corporations.Nevermind that this is false.  This shows that he never adopted the epistomology, because he never actually addresses(no one ever does) what is wrong with wealth inequality.   To many, Income inequality is an intrinsic evil.     >Part of the reason for that is the coming mass automation that will leave something like 40% of everyone unemployed. 15% higher than during the great depression.And if he'd studied economic history he'd know that this had been a myth that won't die ever since the invention of the loom.   Not to mention, that if he knew Epistemology, he would know that since man survives by his means of reason, and that physical automation can not replace human thinking, that the mankind does not become unemployed because machines are making all the physical movements in production.   You didn't read the book description.     They address the issues that arise from a mixed economy.  They have to argue on principle why "inequality" is not an intrinsic evil first.   Then separate the real pain issues out of the inequality debate and connect them to government intervention.  See: https://campus.aynrand.org/~/media/pdf/turning_the_table_on_the_inequality_alarmists.ashx?la=en I was a Libertarian and even worked for the Paul campaign in 08 before I was an Objectivist.  Even after agreeing with the epistemology, ethics, and politics, the stance on terrorism/islam/jihad was something I disagreed with for a long time.   I had a ton of these arguments with other Objectivists.(Side note, objectivists don't believe in government military contracts given out to private groups)Now as an Objectivist, I was already against religion/faith, and even knew that Islam was worse than Christianity(the mix of Aristotelianism in Christianity is what made it much more moderate).   I also knew faith and force were corollaries,   "Anyone who resorts to the formula: "It's so, because I say so," will have to reach for a gun, sooner or later."(http://freedomkeys.com/faithandforce.htm) I also knew that the money/lives that were wasted in military efforts the last 15 years were more damaging to the US than the Jihadist attacks themselves.  And I believed in the "blowback" often preached by those like Ron Paul.   So what changed?     The last two points changed and I learned that this whole issue is FAR more complicated than the catchphrases I was basing my views on.First, I studied Islam more, and compared Islam to many other mystical fanatical groups that had created the same type of violent, selfless, fanaticism(Like Nazism, State Shinto, etc).  I also compared the actions taken in relation to such groups and what the results were.   I found that in every case of appeasement the violent/mystical group were encouraged more, and that their reigns of evil were only ever brought to an end with total unquestionable defeat.  (continuing the easy ww2 example, both Germany and Japan fought to the bitter end, even past the point where any hope was possible.)In relation to the blowback theory, I began to examine who exactly was the aggressor in each of the historical examples in relation to Islam. I also knew the history of militaristic Islamic expansion in the middle ages, the history of the Ottoman Empire including its entering of WW1 with the goal of retaking lost territories it had previously acquired through conquest and it's dismantling after WW1.   I knew the necessary and inevitable destruction and dismantling of the Ottoman Empire was not the West's fault.   I knew the Ottoman Empire ruled with an iron fist and suppressed many fundamentalist religious uprisings itself and that the partitioning of the empire helped lead to the destabilization and rise of more fundamentalist groups.Now, though I disagree with the 1947 UN partition resolution in Palestine, the territory was under British/UN control and had every right to make the resolution, under that resolution the Jewish people declared their independence and had every right to.  Both before and after the Jewish people were very much on the defensive from Arab/Palestinian attacks from within, and the precipitating invasions from Islamic Egypt, Trans-Jordan, Iraq, and Syria.   Now in relation to Israel and Islam most people use the Six Day War as an example of the Islamic states being in a defensive war.  However those same people often leave out the context of the 1948 war where the Islamic countries were the aggressors, they leave out that Egypt had amassed 1000 tanks and 100,000 soldiers on their border, and were openly calling for unified Arab attack against Israel.    Under this context, that situation clearly went way beyond an ‚Äúobjective threat.‚Äù to the Israeli people and was for all purposes a clear intention of war.   What is a country supposed to do under such circumstances?  Sit back and wait for the first tank to cross the border?   Within context, it is clear who the aggressor was, and what the intentions of each side were, as such I fully agree with Isreal's pre-emptive strike against an clear and obvious aggressor. I would like to add that the 1967 war was preceded by countless Arab cross-border attacks on Jewish civilians in Israel. It is also often ignored that every time the two-state solution was on the table, the Jewish side said yes and the Arab side said no: the Peel commission in 1937, the UN partition plan 1947, Israel's offer to return territories after the 1967 war, Camp David 2000, Annapolis Conference 2007, PM Netanyahu's Bar Ilan University Speech 2009. The conflict is not territorial but existential which is proven by official Arab genocidal statements and actions against Israel.It's important to note that following the Ottoman defeat, there was never unified Arab action against Western control, the only unified offensive war that was initiated was against the jews(not the british/french/UN).  If it really was a political/territory issue as many Islamic apologists claim, this unified attack would have happened prior to Israel's existence.  (This had to be clarified because it is often an object of confusion and contention within the topic at large.) Then there is the matter of the nationalization of Western property in relation to oil in the middle east.    This writeup is already too long, so i'll just say that yes, I consider that a violation of rights.On the issue of Iran, one can only be against the US/UK's morally if:  1. You disregard western property rights, and 2. you recognize the right for people to nationalize other people's property & revolt to create a theocracy.   I dont.   The West had a responsibility to it's property rights, and it's property rights only.   If the Iranian revolution was some secular revolution championing individual rights and self-determination(and as such had no intention of nationalizing other's property), then I absolutely would have supported their right to do so and would be 110% against protecting a monarchy.  I think the US/UK of the time would as well.    Ok, so far we've got:* The entire history of middle age aggressive Islamic expansion.* The Ottoman strong arm of violent religious sects.* The Ottoman involvement in WW1* The aggression against the Jews in the 1947 war.* The aggression against the Jews in the Six Day War.* The nationalization of Western properties.* The Iran hostage crisis.And of course the continued history of Islamic attacks since.Combine that with the knowelege that:* Faith and force are corollaries.And you have a pretty clear picture that Islamic Jihad would exist with or without the theory of "Blowback".There are also thousands of written Islamic works and clear study of their views places much more of a emphasis on religious/philosophical/cultural issues than on "intervention" being the cause.    Ok, be that as it may, the US had been intervening plenty particularly after 9/11, and yet the problem has got worse, not better, and we've still lost more money/lives due to intervention.  What I failed to do is define exactly what kind of intervention it was, and what the goal was.I was going to write up a thing on this point, however I think i'm about to pass the 10,000 word limit....To keep it short, the American Foreign policy in the Middle East has not been a defensive total war(like I think if should of been) where the aggressors where totally obliterated(like Germany/Japan).  It very much has been a altruistic nation-building campaign, and that is what I attribute the situation to.    I blame modern education.  Both high schools and colleges. I mean the white guilt people who are told wealth came from slavery.   The questioner didn't bring that up.If he did I would of brought up the points above. Who cares what those people think, they're wrong.  The wealth was created in the 19th century in the most free societies to have ever exist.  There has been slavery and colonialism throughout human history, and yet by some magic it's all together to build off of right after the start of this country.Wealth has to be created, before it can be stolen/looted.   The issue with these brain dead leftists is that they have no idea how wealth is made.If I owned 10 million slaves and put them to work digging a hole(like a bridge) to nowhere, I will never create wealth.However, the man who thought, and invented the loom did create wealth. Yes, he had just finished an hour lecture and was in the middle of giving and hour q&a.   Here's the full video for the q&a.  http://youtu.be/iwb8m_ZbU-UI couldn't find the lecture. Well I'm selfish, but I'm not ignorant.  ;)If the whole world was Capitalist, I'd be better off.    I love MF, he was a brilliant economist and the first question he nailed 100%.  However the second one made me cringe.   People are rich or poor by luck?  We live in a family society?   Eh.    That whole video should be a must watch for all Americans.   I just wrote this for someone else in the /r/philosophy sub, but reading your post I think you might also understand.When I was a child I was bombarded by adults and teachers who constantly told me, "You don't always have to be right.", "It's not always about being right, you know.", "All you care about is being right.", "You're not always right.". Despite their attacks, I continued to argue and demand an answer to: "Is it true?" & "Why?".Looking back, their motive is obvious.I was always one of the smartest students in class, however the unintelligibly of everything and everyone around me began to erode my values.   By the time I got out of highschool and partly through college, I was a mess.   I had lost all the drive, motivation, and passion I had in my youth.  I didn't know what I was doing, where I was going, why I kept suffering, who I was fighting...  None of it made much sense.  .  I dropped out of college, drank and used drugs, and was practically homeless and starving when I picked up my first Rand book.    I've always been an atheist(though my parents were devout Christians) and always wondered about people who claimed that "Jesus Christ saved my life" and went on how Christianity turned their life around for the better.  It's clear to anyone who's studied Christianity that it's goal is not to make YOUR life better here on earth.   Yet, sure enough, many people who's lives were in the gutter, have had their lives changed for the better by Christianity.    After reading Rand, I discovered why.   Regardless of what philosophy a person adopts and regardless if it's a conscious endeavor or a grab bag of mixed premises thrown together, it's clear that human beings require a philosophy to guide their actions and survive.  We are not animals who survive by instinct, we are not born with an instinct to build computers, cars, airplanes, or even a fire and spear.   There are practical consequences for adopting a philosophy which is true or which is false. For example on a macro scale, the degree to which the mainstream philosophy of the times was more true or false has dictated the nature of entire historical periods: Classical Greece, the European Middle Ages, Republican Rome, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the modern Middle East, and modern America today.. When I started reading Rand, I found for the first time in my life someone else that considered, "Is it true?" & "Why?" more important than anything else.    As I read her I began to understand the practical importance of philosophy.  I began to understand that just as I had been hearing "You don't always have to be right.", "It's not always about being right, you know.", "All you care about is being right.", all my life there were philosophers and college professors preaching, "Don't be so sure--nobody can be certain of anything.", "It may be true for you, but it's not true for me.", "Don't be so sure, life is not black and white." and so on...

It did change/save my life.   Now I can give my daughter the life and education she deserves and I can pursue my values and life with confidence...  Now when someone tells me, "Who are you to know?", "Don't be so sure of yourself.", "All you care about is being right."I can answer back with a smile.  "Yes, all I care about is being right."   When I was a child I was bombarded by adults and teachers who constantly told me, "You don't always have to be right.", "It's not always about being right, you know.", "All you care about is being right.", "You're not always right.". Despite their attacks, I continued to argue and demand an answer to: "Is it true?" & "Why?".Looking back, their motive is obvious.I was always one of the smartest students in class, however the unintelligibly of everything and everyone around me began to erode my values.   By the time I got out of highschool and partly through college, I was a mess.   I had lost all the drive, motivation, and passion I had in my youth.  I didn't know what I was doing, where I was going, why I kept suffering, who I was fighting...  None of it made much sense.  .  I dropped out of college, drank and used drugs, and was practically homeless and starving when I picked up my first Rand book.    I've always been an atheist(though my parents were devout Christians) and always wondered about people who claimed that "Jesus Christ saved my life" and went on how Christianity turned their life around for the better.  It's clear to anyone who's studied Christianity that it's goal is not to make YOUR life better here on earth.   Yet, sure enough, many people who's lives were in the gutter, have had their lives changed for the better by Christianity.    After reading Rand, I discovered why.   Regardless of what philosophy a person adopts and regardless if it's a conscious endeavor or a grab bag of mixed premises thrown together, it's clear that human beings require a philosophy to guide their actions and survive.  We are not animals who survive by instinct, we are not born with an instinct to build computers, cars, airplanes, or even a fire and spear.   There are practical consequences for adopting a philosophy which is true or which is false. For example on a macro scale, the degree to which the mainstream philosophy of the times was more true or false has dictated the nature of entire historical periods: Classical Greece, the European Middle Ages, Republican Rome, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the modern Middle East, and modern America today.. When I started reading Rand, I found for the first time in my life someone else that considered, "Is it true?" & "Why?" more important than anything else.    As I read her I began to understand the practical importance of philosophy.  I began to understand that just as I had been hearing "You don't always have to be right.", "It's not always about being right, you know.", "All you care about is being right.", all my life there were philosophers and college professors preaching, "Don't be so sure--nobody can be certain of anything.", "It may be true for you, but it's not true for me.", "Don't be so sure, life is not black and white." and so on...   Just with the teachers of my childhood, their motive is also obvious.When I got to the speech at the end of Atlas Shrugged I honestly cried through most of it....   >‚ÄúBy a feeling he has not learned to identify, but has derived from his first awareness of existence, from his discovery that he has to make choices, man knows that his desperate need of self-esteem is a matter of life or death.

Also, in regards to the person I was talking about and the subject of English and education.(This is her blog: http://www.lisavandamme.com/    I think if you teach English, you just might like her.  )Compare and contrast the pedagogy of modern education to Lisa VanDamme's:>"The proper goal of education is to foster the conceptual development of the child‚Äîto instill in him the knowledge and cognitive powers needed for mature life. It involves taking the whole of human knowledge, selecting that which is essential to the child‚Äôs conceptual development, presenting it in a way that allows the student to clearly grasp both the material itself and its value to his life, and thereby supplying him with both crucial knowledge and the rational thinking skills that will enable him to acquire real knowledge ever after. This is a truly progressive education‚Äîand parents and students should settle for nothing less."  -http://www.vandammeacademy.com/..and how it applies to particular subjects:>Literature-  "We teach literature. ‚ÄúReading,‚Äù commonly crammed in among the spelling drills, vocabulary puzzles, and stream-of-consciousness journaling exercises that comprise ‚ÄúEnglish‚Äù class, often involves no more than a novel or two a year followed up by multiple choice comprehension tests or the dread ‚Äúbook report,‚Äù and mundane excerpts from textbook readers accompanied by instruction in how to find the topic sentence or identify metaphors and similes. But literature is a thrilling journey to other worlds, worlds in which we meet distinctly-drawn and timelessly memorable characters and in which we are exposed to great authors‚Äô unique insights about life.>At VanDamme Academy, students read nearly a dozen novels, plays and stories a year, engage in animated and penetrating daily discussions of plot, characters, and life lessons, learn to see the connection of those life lessons to their own personal experiences, and in doing so become intelligent, thoughtful, and avid readers.>In kindergarten, they are taught to read, seamlessly and seemingly effortlessly, using the ingenious Montessori reading curriculum, which the teacher uses to guide them step-by-enjoyable-step through the reading process. In their elementary years they enjoy such beautiful (and often overlooked) classics as Trumpet of the Swan, E.B. White‚Äôs classic story of a tragically mute trumpeter swan, who, to win his beloved, must learn the art of the real brass trumpet; or The Secret Garden, Frances Hodgson Burnett‚Äôs story of an ill-tempered orphan girl and her invalid cousin who bring a lifeless garden‚Äîand, simultaneously, themselves‚Äîback to glorious, blooming life; or From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, the story of siblings who join their (very distinct) talents to run away from home, live secretly at the Metropolitan museum of art, and solve the mystery of an unauthenticated Michelangelo sculpture.>In junior high, they are ready to devour adult classics like The Miracle Worker, William Gibson‚Äôs play about the feisty and determined Annie Sullivan, who fights the obstinate skepticism of Helen Keller‚Äôs family and succeeds in giving this deaf-and-blind child the miraculous gift of language; Les Miserables, Victor Hugo‚Äôs epic and heart-wrenching story of the underprivileged in 19th-century France; and Cyrano de Bergerac, Rostand‚Äôs moving play about the gallant soldier, brilliant wit and ardent lover whose unyielding independence‚Äîand unsightly appearance‚Äîmake him a tragic failure in life and love.>Literature is one of the cornerstones of a VanDamme Academy education. After a decade of discussing these literary classics, our graduates are not just ‚Äúwell read‚Äù‚Äîthey are perceptive observers, incisive thinkers, and passionate valuers."-->Writing - "We teach writing. The skill of writing is at once supremely important, profoundly difficult, and, in most schools - woefully neglected.>At VanDamme Academy, the skills of writing, reading, vocabulary, spelling and grammar are not all crammed together and cursorily taught under the heading of ‚ÄúEnglish.‚Äù Instead, each of those subjects is its own class, giving these vital skills their due.>Over the course of their education in writing, students learn, step-by-careful step, how to form a complete a meaningful sentence, how to write a clear and articulate paragraph, and how to generate a logical and engaging essay. Additionally, the students write sentences, paragraphs, and essays not just in writing class but in all their classes. I relish the opportunity to tell new students who ask, ‚ÄúWill the test be multiple choice?‚Äù that they will never, ever, in their whole time at VanDamme Academy, have a test that is multiple choice. The only meaningful test of their knowledge is to discover whether they can communicate it, clearly, in complete, individually-generated thoughts.>We do not hand students a sheet of blank paper and tell them to write, the most paralyzing instruction you can give a young student. Our students learn to always follow a definite process, of brainstorming, ordering their thoughts, determining a theme or main idea, outlining, writing a rough draft, and editing, editing, editing. This process is done at school, under the supervision of the writing teacher, who can offer guidance and support. After nearly a decade of going through this writing process again and again, our students emerge as clear, confident, eloquent writers; this is one of the most notable qualities of our graduates. One graduate, when visiting from high school, shared with VDA parents how intimidated his peers from other schools were by writing, whereas his attitude was, ‚ÄúGive me an essay test and I will knock it out of the park.‚Äù>Writing is a crucial and empowering skill for everyone to have, no matter what their interests or career ambitions. Most adults feel it is a skill they are lacking. For VDA students, it becomes second nature." You're welcome, and thank you for writing a response worth it.   Good response.I'll clarify some stuff.    My main beef is with /u/LegoWhore.  As anyone can see from his profile, he first posted this to /r/conservative and /r/Anarcho_Capitalism, he and this article got torn apart there and he refused to address the points made.   When it was posted at /r/philosophy  I copied my response over where he decided to respond to me with a bunch of crap, and right after reposted this to /r/Liberal /r/democrats & /r/progressive.   Though I'll admit it's not my entire motivation, because I noticed that the response I made in /r/philosophy was never actually addressed.  Despite having a disclaimer, "This is not a defense of Rand's philosophy, but proof that the author of the article was wrong."   No one cared to address the article in question, they only wanted to ~~talk about~~ bash Ayn Rand.   So between that, and /u/LegoWhore  being a prick, I copied the response over to each repost.      Out of the 4 places it was copied over, not a single person has addressed a single point that was actually made...   Not a single person for a single point.    ~~I've got to move to another computer, so I'll edit and finish this in a moment...~~The first part of the disconnect -   I agree.>The second part of the disconnect is the tendency by Objectivists to want to turn every conversation into an Aristotelian debateThis is also true.   This because in regards to any subject, the first question an Objectivist asks is:  "Is it true?"If it is not true, then that is the end of it.   Sadly,  /r/philosophy or /r/AcademicPhilosophy is not very interested in that question either.  As for the third part, I also agree. >Though I'm a college English teacher, I find the self-referential and self-congratulatory nature of academia to be insufferable, not much more than ego stroking and philosophical masturbation, and most "academics" not much more than sad sacks desperate for some sort of validation they can't receive elsewhere. There are plenty of folks in higher education out there making an actual difference; you won't find many of them in the philosophy department, alas. ^  That was brilliant.  As for part four:>The fourth disconnect is the tendency of Objectivists to take their philosophy as completely and totally true, cleaving to it with 100% of their hearts and minds. There is no philosophy that is totally accurate. None.I sorta disagree with this.   Regardless of what philosophy a person adopts and regardless if it's a conscious endeavor or a grab bag of mixed premises thrown together, I think it's clear that human beings not only require a philosophy to guide their actions, but there are practical consequences for adopting a philosophy which is true or which is false. (I know, that sentence was atrocious) For example, the degree to which the mainstream philosophy of the times was more true or false has dictated the nature of entire historical periods:  Classical Greece, the European Middle Ages, Republican Rome, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the modern Middle East.   For there to be any knowledge whatsoever there has to be absolutes in an objective universe. If there are such things as "true" and "false, then there is or can be a philosophy that is 100% true, and all that is left up to human beings is the discovery of that philosophy.This does not mean that Objectivism is 100%, I am merely stating the possibility of there existing a 100% true philosophy.  >Which brings me to the fifth disconnect:This is in part based on the premise of part 4.   As for the things I stated in my original post that might apply here, note, I did not try to interpret the 'understanding' for anyone.  I quoted Cummins and then supplied quotes by Rand which were in direct contradiction to Cummins's statements.   If in comparing the quotes you come to the conclusion that Cummins's statements are incorrect, then the "You don't understand" argument absolutely applies.    >And finally the sixth disconnect   This is true to an extent.  However, as I said above, I'm not looking to argue Rand's philosophy.   My goal was to prove that the article was false, and I did.   Looking at the comments, I think you'll agree that no one cares if it's false, and for an objectivist, that is a moral issue.> In the end, philosophy is a bunch of fucking hot air. It's how you live that matters.I like this and agree.   You walk down to any philosophy department and all you hear is hot air that has no practical application to living life.  In objectivism, we talk about the "Moral-Practical Dichotomy"( http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/moral-practical_dichotomy.html ) in modern philosophy, and that it is the source of the disdain for philosophy.    However, as I mentioned above, we all have a philosophy regardless if we want it or not, choose it or not.   The purpose behind Objectivist philosophy is living your life, it's combining the moral and the practical, and makes human life the standard.   Considering your statements about academia and the admission that you teach English, I'll assume that you are aware of the insane pedagogical non-sense being practiced in college, highschools, and elementary schools.   I'm also going to assume that you care about your work, want to be right, and do the best.   I have a two year old daughter, and she has been a driving motivation for me to relearn much of my education and teach her in a proper manner. (A good example is grammar, as I've admitted, it's bad)Lisa Vandamme is an Objectivist Educator and one of my heroes.  To her, philosophy matters and philosophy dictates what is taught and how.   I'll provide a example of what I am talking about below: What does that have to do with the post that proves the article wrong? Typically, when someone claims something to be false, they provide evidence to disprove the subject in question.  Otherwise they are dismissed as baseless.  My post proves the article wrong.   True or false? Oh cute, an anecdotal...That goes well with /u/legowhore's appeal to authority, and the rest of the thread's complete disregard of the fact that I proved with evidence that the article writer was full of shit.  It really says a lot that instead of addressing the theme "The article writer was wrong", you idiots fell right into bashing Rand as much as you could and proving your lack of....  wait for it... objectivity.  Like I said below, what "academic" cites Salon articles as evidence?   The majority of you don't care, you've proven that.  Standards?  Who cares about standards?   I actually am surprised that a few commentators below actually had some integrity, stopped, thought, and admitted, "Yeah, dude brought evidence."  Though, none have yet called out the article writer.    I've proved my case, both against Ms Cummins, and that /r/progressive can't separate their feelings from observation.   Clever, and without a single drop of concrete substance.  You think cute retorts work on me?   Try to actually prove something like I did above, then we'll see what you're made of.    Now stick to the subject, my post proves the article wrong.True or false? > I would think encouraging logical debate vs emotional debate would be encouraged. Does that look to be the case?I wrote the above regarding the article elsewhere and copied it here.   It plainly proves that the linked article is a complete lie.    However, do you really think the people here in this sub care if it's the truth or not?   You seem to, but all evidence suggests your fellow /r/progressive members do not.   Yeah, reality's an asshole.   Actually, I was a leftist when I was a kid.The fact that the above is proof of the article writers dishonesty, and all anyone wants to talk about is politics or tell me Rand is evil....   Is proof of progressive's disinterest in truth, and open dishonesty.  If the ideologues of this sub actually cared about facts and not their feelings then everyone here would of been throwing Denise Cummins under the bus, where she belongs. > You can be right all you wantThat I am.  >I would happily help a stranger fallen in the road. Would you?Sure.>Who do you think society would view in a positive light? Don't need or care for anyone's approval.>Selflessness is only bad when you completely abandon your own interests.Is it?  What's the principle result that makes 100% selflessness bad, but 99%, 70%, 50%, or some other random % good?  > Every other degree that does not kill you is a net positive for society.I live for my own happiness, not some disembodied collective.>Not to mention that the level of unhappiness one has to bear in order to be so insufferable would drive any sane person mad.Heh, no, i'm quite happy with it.   So are the people I listed above.>What is the real incentive to live in your cutthroat system? What's cutthroat about it?    Why would I want to cut anyone's throats?   >Why do you think being an unabashed asshole about a dead fiction writer is going to sway anyone to think her way was the best way?Correction, the person I'm being an asshole to is the writer of this article.  She's earned it by either intentionally lying, or being the most incompetent academic imaginable.  What makes you think I have any intention of swaying anyone here?     My goal was to prove that the Leftwingers here are openly against evidence, proof, and reason.   I succeeded.  >Tools will one day progress to complete automation. How do we feel relevant then? We will live lives of leisure, but those of your ilk must then feel completely useless, no? Would you off yourself so you wouldn't have to live a helpless existence?Machines can do many things, but they can not ever Reason like we can.   If that day you speak of comes there will no longer be any manual labor jobs, but there would be more jobs that require thinking than there are jobs currently in existence.   How do I know?     I know man and the history in depth.  >Not everything is black and white, guy. If there is no black and white, there can be no gray; since gray is merely a mixture of the two.>Remember that when you think you have the answerWhat makes you think I think I'm omniscient?  >What works for you does not work for most people.Alright William James...       You have to have a clue of what exactly works for me before you can make that statement.  >You are not the only one on the planet, therefore the world will never revolve around you.Don't want it to.   Yes, it's obvious that Progressives care nothing for proof, ignore contradictions, and don't care to have any knowledge on a subject before having a view.   Whim worshiping, evidence evading, faith based morons.  You realize that even half of the points i've made about Cummins article are true(and they all are), then I've proved Cummins is a dreadful hack and the rest of you don't give a shit...  Right?    No, of course not.   My post proves the article wrong.True or false? What "academic" cites Salon articles as evidence? Are you fucking kidding me?!She claims that Honduras is an example of Rand's philosophy in practice...    Honduras!Honduras has personal income tax, capital gains tax, social security, corporate tax, and VAT. It is ranked 116th of 178 in the Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom. Honduras is a prime example of the hell of unlimited progressive government. They have complex and unrealistic minimum wage laws (http://www.wageindicator.org/main/salary/minimum-wage/honduras), and the World Bank lists them at #138 (out of 189 countries) on their "hardest countries in which to start a business" list. Also, #166 (of 189) for the worst at enforcing contracts (http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/honduras/). 84% of the country's (overpriced) electricity comes from the state-owned power company, and all international calls have to go thru a state-owned company, too. This is pretty much proof that the Left is insane.   "When the debate is lost, slander becomes the tool of the loser."- SocratesI'm sure that explains all the homeless people Ayn Rand killed in the streets of New York and, of course, in discussing a young Rand thinking on paper in her private journal, lets never mention that she also called Hickman a "purposeless monster" and mentioned his "degeneracy."You can get a fuller picture of what Rand actually wrote and thought in this video: http://www.hqvdos.com/watch/x1KGfnn3cbc/did-ayn-rand-draw-inspiration-from-the-serial-killer-william-hickman-dr-diana-hsieh.htmlLike I said, I've PROVED the dishonesty and lack of intellectual integrity of Denise Cummins and her article.What "academic" cites Salon articles as evidence?

How much pot do you have to smoke in order to lose the ability to smell all the bullshit you're wallowing it? You're pathetic.   How?   Can you manage a logical response?Where are the Rand's adherents murdering people in the street?   Every single thing in that whole article is bullshit.     If you want to attack Rand, fine, but you HAVE to be HONEST about it.>Socrates ‚Äî 'When the debate is lost, slander becomes the tool of the loser.' What are they counting on? That people will not pick up one of Rand's books to find out that Denise Cummings is full of shit?  >Denise Cummings: "(It is perhaps worth noting here that the initial sex scene between the protagonists of Rand‚Äôs book ‚ÄúThe Fountainhead‚Äù is a rape in which ‚Äúshe fought like an animal.‚Äù)"Not only is it a non sequitur, but it's also 100% false.  Dominique did everything she could to lure Roark into her bedroom.If people read a little more closely, they might begin to wonder why Dominique didn't scream or call for help (her servants were within earshot), why she didn't try to run away, etc. And a great many other "why's" emerge if one reads the whole series of scenes going back to the beginning of Chapter 1. Ayn Rand does a masterful job of showing the reader what Dominque was feeling about Roark and about life in general throughout Chapters 1 and 2 (and the rest of the book, as well).  I enjoy asking such people to explain the scene where she horse whips Roark when he sends the little Italian guy to "fix her fireplace". Without admitting that she was desperate to have sex with him. That usually shuts them up.>"But the fact is that Roark did not actually rape Dominique; she had asked for it, and he knew that she wanted it. A man who would force himself on a woman against her wishes would be committing a dreadful crime. What Dominique liked about Roark was the fact that he took the responsibility for their romance and for his own actions. Most men nowadays, like Peter Keating, expect to seduce a woman, or rather they let her seduce them and thus shift the responsibility to her. That is what a truly feminine woman would despise. The lesson in the Roark-Dominique romance is one of spiritual strength and self-confidence, not of physical violence."^ Quoting from Ayn Rand (in Letters of Ayn Rand)-----First, Cummin's whole setup and understanding is a mess:>Denise Cummins: "unfettered self-interest is good and altruism is destructive. This, she believed, is the ultimate expression of human nature, the guiding principle by which one ought to live one‚Äôs life. The fly in the ointment of Rand‚Äôs philosophical ‚Äúobjectivism‚Äù is the plain fact that humans have a tendency to cooperate and to look out for each other, as noted by many anthropologists who study hunter-gatherers."**There are 3 mistakes in this one paragraph.**Mistake 1:>1. "unfettered self-interest is good"She did not advocate unfettered self-interest, she advocated RATIONAL Self-interest. Unfettered means "release from restraint or inhibition." She was not a hedonist. This is not a word she would have ever used to describe what she advocates because it conflates rational self-interest with self-defeating whim-worship. Pursuit of rational self-interest can and does include cooperative behavior. What it does not include is self-sacrificial behavior.Mistake 2:>2. "is the ultimate expression of human nature" .. " the guiding principle by which one ought to live one‚Äôs life" No, she specifically stated that man SURVIVES by means of Reason, and that this is his nature. Self interest is a choice, as well as Altruism. >"Man cannot survive on the perceptual level of his consciousness; his senses do not provide him with an automatic guidance, they do not give him the knowledge he needs, only the material of knowledge, which his mind has to integrate. Man is the only living species who has to perceive reality‚Äîwhich means: to be conscious‚Äîby choice. But he shares with other species the penalty of unconsciousness: destruction. For an animal, the question of survival is primarily physical; for man, primarily epistemological." -Ayn RandMistake 3:>3. "humans have a tendency to cooperate and to look out for each other" NO WHERE in any of Rand's writing does she disparage cooperation. Cooperation happens under capitalism in every single voluntary transaction. Rand considered Altruism(self-sacrifice) evil, however altruism and cooperation are not the same thing. Rand readily acknowledged the benefits of social cooperation provided the social interactions are based on mutual respect of individual rights. >"Can man derive any personal benefit from living in a human society? Yes‚Äîif it is a human society. The two great values to be gained from social existence are: knowledge and trade. Man is the only species that can transmit and expand his store of knowledge from generation to generation; the knowledge potentially available to man is greater than any one man could begin to acquire in his own lifespan; every man gains an incalculable benefit from the knowledge discovered by others. The second great benefit is the division of labor: it enables a man to devote his effort to a particular field of work and to trade with others who specialize in other fields. This form of cooperation allows all men who take part in it to achieve a greater knowledge, skill and productive return on their effort than they could achieve if each had to produce everything he needs, on a desert island or on a self-sustaining farm. -Ayn Rand in "The Objectivist Ethics"**She claims that Honduras is an example of Rand's philosophy in practice... Honduras!  What "academic" cites Salon articles as evidence?**Honduras has personal income tax, capital gains tax, social security, corporate tax, and VAT. It is ranked 116th of 178 in the Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom.  Honduras is a prime example of the hell of unlimited progressive government.

If you want to attack Rand, fine, but you HAVE to be HONEST about it.>Socrates ‚Äî 'When the debate is lost, slander becomes the tool of the loser.' What are they counting on? That people will not pick up one of Rand's books to find out that Denise Cummings is full of shit?  >Denise Cummings: "(It is perhaps worth noting here that the initial sex scene between the protagonists of Rand‚Äôs book ‚ÄúThe Fountainhead‚Äù is a rape in which ‚Äúshe fought like an animal.‚Äù)"Not only is it a non sequitur, but it's also 100% false.  Dominique did everything she could to lure Roark into her bedroom.If people read a little more closely, they might begin to wonder why Dominique didn't scream or call for help (her servants were within earshot), why she didn't try to run away, etc. And a great many other "why's" emerge if one reads the whole series of scenes going back to the beginning of Chapter 1. Ayn Rand does a masterful job of showing the reader what Dominque was feeling about Roark and about life in general throughout Chapters 1 and 2 (and the rest of the book, as well).  I enjoy asking such people to explain the scene where she horse whips Roark when he sends the little Italian guy to "fix her fireplace". Without admitting that she was desperate to have sex with him. That usually shuts them up.>"But the fact is that Roark did not actually rape Dominique; she had asked for it, and he knew that she wanted it. A man who would force himself on a woman against her wishes would be committing a dreadful crime. What Dominique liked about Roark was the fact that he took the responsibility for their romance and for his own actions. Most men nowadays, like Peter Keating, expect to seduce a woman, or rather they let her seduce them and thus shift the responsibility to her. That is what a truly feminine woman would despise. The lesson in the Roark-Dominique romance is one of spiritual strength and self-confidence, not of physical violence."^ Quoting from Ayn Rand (in Letters of Ayn Rand)-----First, Cummin's whole setup and understanding is a mess:>Denise Cummins: "unfettered self-interest is good and altruism is destructive. This, she believed, is the ultimate expression of human nature, the guiding principle by which one ought to live one‚Äôs life. The fly in the ointment of Rand‚Äôs philosophical ‚Äúobjectivism‚Äù is the plain fact that humans have a tendency to cooperate and to look out for each other, as noted by many anthropologists who study hunter-gatherers."**There are 3 mistakes in this one paragraph.**Mistake 1:>1. "unfettered self-interest is good"She did not advocate unfettered self-interest, she advocated RATIONAL Self-interest. Unfettered means "release from restraint or inhibition." She was not a hedonist. This is not a word she would have ever used to describe what she advocates because it conflates rational self-interest with self-defeating whim-worship. Pursuit of rational self-interest can and does include cooperative behavior. What it does not include is self-sacrificial behavior.Mistake 2:>2. "is the ultimate expression of human nature" .. " the guiding principle by which one ought to live one‚Äôs life" No, she specifically stated that man SURVIVES by means of Reason, and that this is his nature. Self interest is a choice, as well as Altruism. >"Man cannot survive on the perceptual level of his consciousness; his senses do not provide him with an automatic guidance, they do not give him the knowledge he needs, only the material of knowledge, which his mind has to integrate. Man is the only living species who has to perceive reality‚Äîwhich means: to be conscious‚Äîby choice. But he shares with other species the penalty of unconsciousness: destruction. For an animal, the question of survival is primarily physical; for man, primarily epistemological." -Ayn RandMistake 3:>3. "humans have a tendency to cooperate and to look out for each other" NO WHERE in any of Rand's writing does she disparage cooperation. Cooperation happens under capitalism in every single voluntary transaction. Rand considered Altruism(self-sacrifice) evil, however altruism and cooperation are not the same thing. Rand readily acknowledged the benefits of social cooperation provided the social interactions are based on mutual respect of individual rights. >"Can man derive any personal benefit from living in a human society? Yes‚Äîif it is a human society. The two great values to be gained from social existence are: knowledge and trade. Man is the only species that can transmit and expand his store of knowledge from generation to generation; the knowledge potentially available to man is greater than any one man could begin to acquire in his own lifespan; every man gains an incalculable benefit from the knowledge discovered by others. The second great benefit is the division of labor: it enables a man to devote his effort to a particular field of work and to trade with others who specialize in other fields. This form of cooperation allows all men who take part in it to achieve a greater knowledge, skill and productive return on their effort than they could achieve if each had to produce everything he needs, on a desert island or on a self-sustaining farm. -Ayn Rand in "The Objectivist Ethics"She claims that Honduras is an example of Rand's philosophy in practice... Honduras!  What "academic" cites Salon articles as evidence?Honduras has personal income tax, capital gains tax, social security, corporate tax, and VAT. It is ranked 116th of 178 in the Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom.  Honduras is a prime example of the hell of unlimited progressive government. They have complex and unrealistic minimum wage laws (http://www.wageindicator.org/main/salary/minimum-wage/honduras), and the World Bank lists them at #138 (out of 189 countries) on their "hardest countries in which to start a business" list.Also, #166 (of 189) for the worst at enforcing contracts (http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/honduras/). 84% of the country's (overpriced) electricity comes from the state-owned power company, and all international calls have to go thru a state-owned company, too.It's enough to discredit this crap just with the first two points, so I'll go straight to the question posed: >"So what if people behaved according to Rand‚Äôs philosophy of ‚Äúobjectivism‚Äù?
